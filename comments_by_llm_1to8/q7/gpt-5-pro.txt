  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines layer image, action, and thematic weight ("The wings were once gentle, but the flood taught them to write"). Rhythm varies purposefully, balancing long reflective sentences with clipped declaratives in the triage passages. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative coherence is strong except for one mixed vehicle: "drumline of plastic and branches and patience" conflates percussion with endurance in a way that strains sense. Opening and closing lines charge the frame effectively. Minor deduction for density of metaphor in the final third—most sentences carry figurative weight, approaching but not crossing into overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance discovery, setting, or thematic layering. Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric sentences in reflective beats and shorter units during the search. Two frictions: paraphrase loop in "It was not empty, just spacious, the kind of hush where a life can set without cracking. I breathed with it" restates stillness without adding pressure. Stock metaphor "leaned like folded wings" (crates) is decorative. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt that memory tug," "felt my purpose gather") in peak beats slightly dulls immediacy. No severe artifacts, but these accumulate to prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high ("frost became score, hands became choir, and the tower learned to speak by warming"). Most lines advance image, character, or atmosphere. Minor paraphrase loop: "we never faked applause, but the snow...crusted with boot-prints" and the adjacent "printed ovation" rephrase the same concept without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative language is concentrated but mostly coherent; "fretted into lace" and "braided through them like patient breath" work. One slip: "their noise curdled into nothing, like bubbles that forget to burst" mixes vehicle (curdling, forgetting) in a way that strains logic (−0.3). No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong figurative density throughout: "grief runs me the way water wears a channel," "Books rise from the silt, shaking off eels like tassels," "the pressure of the deep resolving into the weight someone calls home." Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Rhythm varies purposefully. Deductions: several near-paraphrase loops ("the drowned never quite stop knocking" / "the drowned have been sending distress signals"; "to give rest a permanent address" recurs three times with minor variation). Overwriting in the middle third: figurative language appears in almost every sentence during the library work without clear pattern-teaching, edging toward density for its own sake ("spines bloom with names," "hair combed flat by currents," "rings that learned the circular grammar of waves"). A few stock metaphors: "thin code," "hollow crown." Elevated diction in peak beats slightly obscures immediacy. No major clarity breaks, but the accumulation caps Q7 below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Metaphor coherence holds except for one mixed vehicle: "antique silver bell that shivered even in sunlight, as if homesick"—metal shivers from cold, not warmth; the homesick vehicle is emotionally apt but physically contradictory. Light paraphrase loop: "No names would be thanked, no names would be shamed" / "we will keep it nameless" recurs without adding pressure. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly voice-motivated and legible. Minor deductions for the mixed metaphor and loop; otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm is controlled and sentence openings vary, but figurative density is high throughout without significant pattern-teaching or cost linkage in most beats. Mixed metaphors appear: "box is a breathing lantern" (box breathes or emits light?) and "my friend sets his whisk glowing…a slow comet…writing constellations" (comet/constellation vehicle unclear). Stock phrasing: "gentle and patient," "simple applause." Paraphrase loops: "unused love is stored" recurs without added pressure across three paragraphs. Template cadence in mid-section: "I breathe shallow…I breathe full…" parallels without escalation. Information density is moderate; many lines do two jobs, but some sentences ("Tonight it waits like a gentle animal") are ornamental. No pronoun drift or spatial confusion. Deductions: figurative muddle −0.5, paraphrase loop −0.2, template cadence −0.4, stock metaphor −0.2 (total within-band cap −1.3).

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot ("frost stenciled lace on the leaves and my breath made tiny planets" does triple duty). Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is controlled ("coral," "lung of green shadow," "ink dropped into water"). However, several paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs lower the score: "It used to crown...the bronze body eaten...the circle split" repeats structure without added pressure; "I was retrocognitively trapped, not in a single past but in the garden's entire rehearsal" restates the same idea across clauses. The phrase "quaking reverie" in the middle echoes the tone element without advancing scene work. No grammar errors; clarity remains high despite lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes). Some figurative language clusters in the opening third ("stubborn drawer," "swallow's apology," "heavy applause") without harming clarity, but a few stock phrases emerge ("mean sun," "fragile verb"). The final third tightens propulsion. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; grammar and sequencing are clean. A minor scaffold phrase ("I work quickly, calculating") appears mid-story, applying −0.2 once.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information-per-sentence ("coils wound from salvaged filaments and apple wire, each loop tempered by polar light"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; sentence openings vary naturally. Minor overwriting appears in the middle section—figurative density ("cochlear organoids," "sapbeats," "metronome for patience") occasionally slows momentum without a taught pattern. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Clarity remains high despite the lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative language is dense and often lyrical ("tides," "coastlines," "minnows," "lanterns"), but metaphors occasionally crowd each other without clear physical grounding—"redistributing choices into new coasts" and "a heart being reinterpreted by tides" layer abstractions in adjacent lines. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm is controlled, but information density dips when metaphor replaces concrete action (e.g., "the moonbeams clicked their tiny shutters"). A few paraphrase loops appear ("carrying away," "carry away") and the phrase "reinterpret" recurs five times, approaching template cadence. Clarity holds, but the lyric texture occasionally obscures causal sequence, lowering propulsion in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and rhythm are strong in many beats ("ice was loosening its grip on the rafters, clicking like timid fingernails"), but paraphrase loops appear: "The answer arrives as a rattle...Back then, I silenced my questions" recounts rather than dramatizes the memory's pressure. Template cadence runs in the "Cue the oxygen...Cue the fire...Cue the turn" sequence without clear payoff that reweights stakes. Several lines restate gentleness and patience ("patient," "slow," "kindly") in adjacent paragraphs. Applying the paraphrase-loop and template-cadence penalties (−0.2, −0.4) and the Non-closure Accumulation Cap yields a mid-6 score.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high across most beats. However, overwriting clusters in peak moments: "my heartbeat a drumline I could not keep in straight time," "fear answer," "film reflower" stack metaphors without always clarifying the image. Template-cadence runs appear ("I told him how... I told him the... I told him...") in the climax, and paraphrase loops ("transformative betrayal, the kind that does not end you so much as replace your hinges") slow momentum. Mixed-vehicle metaphors ("breath keeps arguing," "truth knocked like a stunt punch") and elevated diction ("biography section," "circulation desk") in a visceral crisis scene create register drift. Artifacts in the final third disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with strong images ("spindrift across the storm-tossed ridge," "the star riding like a nail above the surf," "reefs wait"). Information density is high in early paragraphs, and figurative language is mostly vivid and coherent. Three friction points lower the grade: (1) "marbled hush" recurs four times without functional variation, risking motif fatigue; (2) the sequence "We set… Wind paced… We waited" in the final paragraph uses identical "We [verb]" stems in close succession, creating template cadence at closure; (3) minor opacity in "ambered hush" and "syruped quietude poured from a wound in time"—the vehicles are adjacent in sensory register and blur slightly. The closure beat ("We waited in the marbled hush until the last star lowered, and the booklet emptied its gold") is clean but the prior template run dulls momentum just before it.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with short declaratives in early loops ("I signed," "I said") giving way to longer, layered sentences at closure. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and the central question. A handful of near-paraphrases appear ("loop by loop" constructions, multiple "the courtyard" sentence openings in the final third) that slightly dull propulsion. No template cadence or mixed metaphors touch the closure beats. The final image ("pressed my broom into service again, remarkably composed, and the courtyard agreed to be new") is clean and charged. Figurative language is consistent (steam as cursive, sky's cuffs reflected, note wearing answers like a scarf) without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines layer image, character, and pressure ("Under the lens, the doodles swelled into chambers; the rain beads inside the glass connected dots the pen had not"). Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm breathes. Two minor frictions: "resonant hush" appears four times, risking scaffold; and "ambiguously clear" is both descriptor and required attribute, creating a hint of prompt echo. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and figurative language ("the forecourt hummed like a throat readying a vowel") remains coherent. Clarity and propulsion are strong, with no artifacts touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at closure, longer syntactic weaving in reflection). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. One minor scaffold pattern: repeated "I + verb" stems across the opening third (seven instances in close succession) create slight cadence monotony but do not obscure causality. Figurative language is purposeful and mostly coherent ("light shaped by hands is labor," "marbles into tiny constellations") though "blooming withering" as a closing verb phrase is compressed to near-opacity without prior teaching. Clarity remains high; no filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats. Paragraph structure varies. The final line ("The garden knows me, and I know it") is clean and charges prior material without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the experiment. Figurative language is frequent ("like embered breath inside a helmet of frost," "dreams...rendered as currents of light") and occasionally stacks without clear payoff, risking overwriting in high-pressure beats. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "subdued awakenings" recurs three times without added pressure, and "icy warmth" is restated as "mechanically warm" without transformation. Template cadence is avoided, and sensory detail is strong. The closure beat is clean. Deductions for density without escalation and mild figurative muddle prevent entry to 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"indecisive fireflies," "language seemed as clumsy as wet wood," "a single wrong sound, consummately placed, can realign a theater"—and occasionally competes for attention in high-pressure beats where clarity would serve better. The phrase "amid the hush of unstruck chords" recurs as bookend framing, which charges the closure but also reads slightly ornamental. Information density is strong: most lines do double work (sensory + stakes, or action + interiority). No loops or synonym churn. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the final image lands cleanly. The overwriting remains just within tolerance because the voice is consistent and the closure image is not obscured, but sustained metaphor in the mezzanine-crack sequence ("surged," "took the crowd like a lung") begins to feel effortful.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "He had promised the director to keep such maps off paper, and I had promised to keep him from trouble" compresses motive, relationship, and institutional constraint in one beat). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short declaratives at the broadcast ("I take the microphone"), longer accumulative sentences during reflection. Minor loop: "to find the weight of a swallowed truth" appears verbatim twice (paragraphs 3 and 26), and "occupying margins" recurs without functional shift. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. The graphite-lifting image is vivid and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic propulsion. Information density is high—most lines do double or triple duty (e.g., "The beads were glass and plastic, wired clumsily...tokens pressed by fingers that needed warmth or luck or grip, souvenir saints for unbelievers like me" advances object description, thematic motif, and character stance simultaneously). Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("silence pressed," "truth like a pill," "tags in my cheek like a coin"). Minor loop: "drowsy alertness" recurs three times with slight variation, and "hush" appears frequently without always adding new pressure. One filter-verb cluster in the middle third ("I heard," "I felt," "I could see") slightly dulls immediacy during the wheel-turn beat. No major scaffold or paraphrase loops, and the final image is sharp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm and imagery are strong—"dust fell like pale rain," "the regenerative silence wove itself through fear like thread closing a wound"—and sentence openings vary. However, paraphrase loops appear: "crumbling peace" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure, and the closing lines recycle the drift-of-seasons phrasing from earlier. Template cadence surfaces in mid-section ("We returned always, because…"; "Others set stones…, as if…") where parallel constructions repeat without taught pattern. Line-level clarity is high, but density suffers from minor redundancy. No major artifacts touch closure, so deductions stay moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic resonance. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("lacework shadows," "tears...held like stars," "quiet like a seed"). Minor overwriting: "shadows sharpened like careful pencil lines" and "a silence so clean it felt rinsed" cluster metaphor in adjacent lines. One paraphrase-loop candidate: "We waited for the first bite of shadow" / "When the light thinned" restates the eclipse's onset. Stock metaphor: "tucked like a heartbeat" in the opening. No template cadence or major scaffold. Propulsion is steady; no loops obscure the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; nearly every line does double duty (e.g., "carbon dust marking his fingertips like new fingerprints" ties tactile detail to axis-shift motif). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and no major loops appear. Two frictions: several beats use similar template cadence ("It spoke of…" x3 in close succession); figurative language is dense throughout ("ribs become vocal cords," "field lines buckled," "tilt changed the stories like rain slanting") without pattern-teaching or consistent vehicle logic, risking overwriting. The closure beat—"inscribing bronze quiet into paper so the walls could rest"—remains clear despite elevated diction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density (metronome beam, glass cathedral, staff lines of steam) enriches without obscuring. Several template stems recur ("They told how..."), and synonym churn appears in adjacent lines ("orchestrate arrival by directing flow" / "arrange the standing by directing flow"). Paraphrase loops in the middle third ("open secrets" rephrased across three paragraphs) trigger −0.4. No major opacity at closure, but tightening would lift momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high: "He layered a hush, then a longer hush, and let the recording feed back on itself." Several metaphors are striking ("scabbed moons around a single blue sun") but some edge toward overwriting: "braided like river grip around a stone," "moved like a thumb over vellum." A few filter verbs cluster ("He tried to plumb," "felt the dimensional anchor") without harming clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Figurative density is high but mostly earned; the final third maintains momentum. One run of similar constructions ("Let there be") is purposeful anaphora, not template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.3)
    Figurative language is dense and controlled; most images advance atmosphere and the conductor conceit. Sentence openings vary, paragraphs create visual rhythm. Minor loop: "upturned hush" recurs three times with slight variation but no material reweighting between instances, trending toward ornament. A few lines edge into elevated register that strains legibility under the POV's crisis state ("articulation, not sleep but lucid rest"), though clarity never fully breaks. No major scaffold or synonym churn; information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, vivid compression ("lamp cast a halo that grew thinner with each minute, a darkening brightness that felt like breath fading"). A few synonym-adjacent phrases cluster mid-piece ("reflect, rotate, invert" / "reflected on the boy… rotated the scene… inverted the guilt") in template cadence, and "periodically eternal" recurs as label without fresh embodiment in two beats (−0.4). No paraphrase loops or scaffold in peak beats. Rhythm accelerates into the fall and slows cleanly at closure. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and land the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence in the cavern sequence: multiple sentences begin with "She [verb]" or "He [verb]" across adjacent lines, and the drum's effect is restated in near-synonyms ("mirrored hush," "audibly muted," "patient throbs," "tremor like a candle"). The backward-songs concept and filament mechanics are described rather than made tactile through distinct action. Stock metaphor strings ("grief walking back to its doorway," "timid bird warming its own egg") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she imagined," "she noticed") in high-pressure beats reduce propulsion and trigger template-cadence and paraphrase-loop deductions totaling approximately −1.2 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Figurative density is high and generally coherent ("quiet courtyard at dusk holding the day's last breaths like folded paper boats"), but several constructions border on overwriting without payoff: "air still felt classified, as if stamped reluctantly with approval" mixes metaphors; "the sky practiced remaining undecided" stacks personification. A paraphrase loop appears mid-story: "I would go once more to the perimeter, not to sneak but to stand where wind shifts, and write what the fences cannot muffle" recaps the lateral-approach idea stated two paragraphs prior. Information density is strong in the pigeon sequence and closing vow; rhythm modulates appropriately. Aggregate artifact penalty totals approximately −0.6 in Q7 for density and minor loop, escalated slightly because one figurative clash occurs in the closure third.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create visual and auditory texture ("I brush dust from a mural, coaxing a whale from clay, its spine a fractured calendar"). Information density is high, with most lines serving multiple functions (character, atmosphere, stakes). Minor scaffold slips: "I am ethically playful" and "These are impossible choices" edge toward label-only summary rather than dramatized pressure. A brief paraphrase loop appears in the penultimate reflection ("It was patience… and we love by letting them remain layered") that restates the thematic claim without new pressure. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "breath like torn silk" and "rope… a mobile sky of knots" are vivid and apt. No major clarity breaks or loops that obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: "The chronic hush tightens, then cracks like thin ice under a patient foot" delivers clear propulsion and image. Information density is high, with most lines advancing both atmosphere and event. However, several beats exhibit template cadence and paraphrase loops: "Mara comes to find beauty in the unfinished, because finished things end and end again" (the second clause restates the first without added pressure). "The chronic hush does not vanish; it learns to listen, to share, to breathe behind voices" / "When she plays… the sea holds quiet but not empty"—near-synonym closure. These patterns accumulate across the final third, dulling the closure image slightly. Penalty: −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template stems touching closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, and stakes). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor deductions: "affectionate detachment" appears three times (opening, midpoint, near-end), creating mild synonym churn around the central concept; "the grotto warmed as if a hearth had breathed" and "the grotto dimmed like a patient closing their eyes" are vivid but slightly strained metaphors given the amber-stone setting. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and figurative language serves voice rather than obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings avoid template runs. Information density is high in the envelope-discovery and tuner-recognition beats. However, the final third features paraphrase loops ("We had begun something gentle yet sturdy, a chorus sung in whispers..."; "Each card would remind the next card...") and elevated diction that drifts from the broker's earlier concrete voice ("cautious exuberance," "continuous return"). Filter-verb use is restrained. Proofreading clean; no grammar breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift between subject, prepositional, and participial. Information density is high: "They pressed their stories into the bench, a lattice of anecdotes, splinters smoothed by laughter, until the weave remembered more than my wrists" layers action, image, and thematic resonance. Minor artifice: some figurative phrasing accumulates without clear escalation ("glimmering," "shimmering," "luminescent" appear frequently), and a few lines near the climax risk purple prose ("webs of kinship trembled awake"). No loops or scaffolding detected. Propulsion is strong, with strategic telling compressing transit ("We walked between trunks") to preserve momentum for the dedication beat.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (most lines advance setting, action, or thematic charge). Minor template cadence in the middle third: several "I [verb]" stems cluster without taught pattern ("I set," "I caress," "I follow," "I unclasp," "I sketch"). One paraphrase loop: "the city a knot" echoes "weaving between towers" without adding pressure. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "syrup-thickens" and "shimmer like a bubble made of memory" work, though "bright animal pacing inside a cage whose bars are beats" verges on mixed vehicle. No clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines serve image, character, or pressure. Figurative language is purposeful and mostly coherent ("equations went feral," "theorem unfinished"). A handful of lines repeat concepts across adjacent beats without added pressure: "secretive conjurer, gently inventive by necessity" closely mirrors "I work via the chipped patterns" in function; "I ask the figure to stay, but I ask the orchard to speak" and the subsequent "compromise" restate the same moment. Template cadence appears in the mid-section with repeated "I [verb], I [verb]" constructions. These warrant a −0.6 deduction in Q7 for paraphrase and template patterns, but the closure beat itself remains clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense and imagistic with strong rhythm: "sapphire hush," "burr of recorded grit," "granular world holding breath." Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Sentence openings vary. Minor artifacts: "sense memory" is invoked three times as a concept rather than always dramatized, and a few metaphors risk overwriting ("fish to a stream after thunder" feels slightly generic). "Kindly methodical" recurs as a label in one line. Figurative density is high but mostly legible; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Clarity and propulsion are strong; no loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: "I kept notes that read like apologies, and they did not fool me" shifts cadence cleanly. Information density is high; nearly every line advances character stance or atmospheric pressure. Two artifacts lower the score: (1) runs of parallel "I [verb]" stems in the final third create template cadence ("I would reconstruct… I would keep returning… I still wince… I let the leaf decide"), and (2) minor paraphrase loop between "releasing control to the weather" (line 23) and "by releasing control to water" (line 13). Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated throughout; no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies effectively ("The drip became a ribbon, the ribbon a current") and information density is high across most beats. Figurative language generally serves pressure: "cistern mouth was a black coin," "spine uncoiling." However, elevated register occasionally drifts from POV plausibility—"haggard awe" repeats as a stock phrase, and "unearthed convergence" reads more authorial than character-voice in peak moments. Opening and closing lines anchor well (tide as lung / rain teaching). Minor paraphrase loop: "amber holds sunlight like a breath, and this one held more than the sun" restates without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and the stake. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. However, several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "I explain that unseen forces inhabit…" followed by "Still, the cave keeps itself steadily unpredictable" restates mood without added pressure. "They say they promised… / That promise aligns…" loops the promise concept. In the closure sequence, runs of short clauses ("We hum, and the sound walks away… then returns… The thresh of ordinary life has become…") create slight monotony. Apply patterned-artifact penalty (−0.6) for loops and template cadence across multiple beats, though none touch the final image directly. No figurative muddle; metaphors remain coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with high information load per line. Figurative language (gulls, kelp, spray, breath) coheres into a marine texture that charges the closure. Minimal loops or scaffolding; each paragraph advances. However, repeated stems ("I [verb]," "We [verb]") and near-synonym clusters ("hearten," "listening," "shaped questions") appear in adjacent lines without full pattern payoff. Stock metaphors ("dry bones waking," "houses stop flinching") dilute specificity in two beats. The closure beat remains clean and imagistically strong.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm is controlled and lyric, yet runs of similar metaphoric structures ("folded like a transfer ticket," "hummed like tuning forks," "curling like a signature") create template cadence across the piece, reducing propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "I approached, heart quivering" followed immediately by "A voice crackled from nowhere" restates readiness without added pressure. Filter verbs ("I felt the old itch," "I thought of the dare") stack in the opening, dulling immediacy. Figurative density is high—most sentences carry metaphor—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure escalation, triggering overwriting penalties. Clarity remains legible, but momentum sags under decorative weight, especially in the vault sequence where abstract phrasing ("the backs of words, their meanings glowing on the far side") slows the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several beats show overwriting: "thin stars braided like hair across the table, luminous strands spooling" stacks metaphors without clarifying the tile's mechanics. "Unheard symphony" recurs five times, approaching template cadence without sufficient reweighting. Paraphrase loop: "I realized that to transcribe was not to trap, but to catch the wind" / "we had planted the hollows as well as the seeds" both restate balance without added pressure. Filter-verb stack in reflection-heavy beats ("I knew," "I realized," "I told him") slightly dulls immediacy. Clarity remains mostly intact; deductions for density and loop accumulation reach −1.0 within Q7, with artifacts touching but not obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and dense with purpose: "It spoke in negations, in knots that unknotted only if you promised not to pull them, a child's paradox." Information density is high; most lines advance character, action, or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. One mild friction: a few metaphors approach overwriting ("the corridor the color of forgotten promises") but remain legible and do not dull the closure image. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph structure supports momentum. No grammar, tense, or continuity errors detected.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., "I dipped the nib into the ink pot, its lacquered body older than my oaths, and tallied one more necessity" advances plot, character, and motif). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is controlled except for brief stacks in the opening third ("cold moons," "black mouth," "solvent for certainties" cluster densely but remain legible). No loops, no scaffold, no template cadence. Minor slip: "drips from the faucet to keep the beat steady" is slightly mechanical in a high-pressure beat, but the payoff (officers' attention sag) justifies the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("minutes keep the pulse company," "drama would snap these fragile hours like thread"). However, metaphor density approaches saturation in high-pressure beats without clear payoff, and several paraphrase loops recur: "charting the faint hum" / "chart peaks of memory," "invented histories" restated across multiple paragraphs. Template cadence appears in mid-section ("I record… I note… I tuck…"), flattening propulsion. Closurebeat remains clean, capping penalty at −0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Every snippet is a shell pressed to my ear" advances method, voice, and metaphor). Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric sentences in reflection and shorter beats in action ("I left him with silence"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Two minor slips lower the score: "a code, too, a letter flicked sideways" repeats the code-as-cause motif without adding pressure, and "the hush of rain" after "hum of backdoors" risks stock poetic pairing. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and voice-motivated, though "diesel sheen, thin yet stubborn" and "murder that had learned to bathe" approach overwriting in adjacent beats.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically dense, with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. However, paraphrase loops and metaphoric restatements accumulate in the middle third: "the method was simple, and strange" is followed by "Words gathered, not heard but felt, a transcript in vibrations"; "the universal riddle does not ask what binds everything" is restated as "the answer…is a practice of gentle refusal." Template cadence appears in stacked reflective stems ("I wanted…Instead…I laughed…I turned…I understood"). Figurative language appears in most sentences of several high-pressure beats without clear pattern-teaching, creating mild overwriting (−0.5). One clear loop: "gloomy cheerfulness" opens the story and reappears verbatim in paragraph 29, but the reprise reweights the phrase, so the effect is purposeful. No grammar or tense errors. Scaffold is minimal. The closing line ("even a cliff can feel like a cradle when you listen") is strong, but the cumulative metaphoric density and restatement loops merit a −0.8 deduction in Q7, pushing the grade below 7.0. The artifacts do not obscure the closure image, so no Q2 bleed-through occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies naturally, and many lines do double work ("The chip found its place inside the mouth of a painted shrimp, and a path bloomed that rerouted the main glitter current around Old Clinic Row"). However, the piece accumulates metaphorical density without clear escalation—nearly every sentence in the first third carries figurative language ("confetti, tide charts, and whispered apologies braided together," "feathers were not already molting," "flowed like song"), which softens momentum rather than sharpening it. Several phrases loop conceptually: "hopeful desperation" appears twice with similar framing, and "dual allegiance" is restated in multiple forms across the arc. The final paragraph's "dual allegiance no longer a split but a braid" followed by "steadier choices" risks paraphrase. Filter verbs and abstract nominalizations ("the smell of our dawns," "the shared costume") occasionally dull immediacy. No major grammatical errors, but the prose would benefit from selective pruning to raise information density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs ("I kneel by the vial set into a ring of basalt chips and breathe through the mask" grounds action, ritual, and environment). Rhythm varies naturally and accelerates at closure ("I press the shutter and hear the briefest thunder of cloth and spring, a last honest sound"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor weakness: a few lines edge toward figurative density without full payoff ("logos comb their antlers across the day, hunting for buyers" is vivid but the vehicle—antlers—reads slightly strained). Propulsion is strong; no scaffolding or filler.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the repair and navigation beats. However, patterned stock metaphors cluster: "breathed like a sleeping animal," "iron prayers," "magnetic calm," "day opened across engines and waves." The final paragraph loops thematic summary ("one artisan listened until the world answered in kind") that restates rather than sharpens. Figurative language in most lines of the opening and closing beats without clear payoff applies −0.5. Clarity and propulsion remain solid in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or the central search. Rhythm varies naturally (short declarations, longer lyric runs), and sentence openings shift. Minimal loops; occasional near-paraphrase ("the tranquility of it worries me" / "It is a worrying tranquility") but spaced and voice-motivated. Figurative language is concentrated and consistent with POV ("isobaric prayer," "antlers," "throat where pressures meet"). One minor scaffold moment: "I tell the falcon, who answers by clacking its beak at the world as if taking dictation" feels slightly self-conscious. Proofreading is clean. Propulsion remains steady without sluggishness; the accretion supports the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm is controlled and vivid ("wild hush," "smoke-dark hum," "black gull on tide"), but figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or simile, risking overwriting in a piece this compressed. Minor template cadence appears: "He told me... His name did not matter... We circled..." runs of similar stems. A paraphrase loop surfaces mid-story: "the archway drank the pattern" / "stones listen for the downbeat" restate the same premise across adjacent paragraphs without new pressure. No outright clarity breaks, but the accumulation of ornament slows momentum in non-peak beats, costing ~−0.6 in aggregate.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (the net "caught me and the transmitter both" advances plot and metaphor). No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence across high-pressure beats—"hawk tightening its claws on its own legs," "a gathered hush made visible, breathing in place like a sleeping animal," "doors to swing where there had been walls"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, applying a −0.5 deduction in this category. The closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("slow as a heart made of clockwork salt"), but the accumulation across consecutive sentences ("rumors were my inheritance," "thread a labyrinth with your own story," "sustains impossibilities," "filtering the corridor into strips") without variation in mode triggers overwriting penalties (−0.5). Template-cadence runs appear ("I learned," "I needed," "I understood," "I had to," "I will") in the final third (−0.4). A paraphrase loop occurs in the pantry beat: "false panic" / "different" restates the same contrast without added pressure (−0.2). Information density is high, but the figurative load and stem repetition dull momentum approaching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentences open differently, and paragraph lengths create visual and conceptual breathing. Information density is high—most lines advance image, atmosphere, or character stance. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but coherent within the alchemical-lyric mode taught early. Minor deduction: a few phrases approach ornamental ("ash lifting from her veil like steam off morning bread") without pressing the action forward at that beat, and the line "Her eyes held both graves and bells" stacks metaphor without clear vehicle logic. Propulsion remains strong through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high across most beats. However, figurative density approaches saturation in several passages (tide pools exhale, canyon as hush, walls "swallow," stone parts "with shy gratitude," corridors "open like lungs"), risking overwriting without clear pattern-teaching or payoff tied to escalation. A mild paraphrase loop appears in the repeated "broken precedents" framing (lines 5, 6, final paragraph) without added pressure each time. No severe scaffold or template cadence, and the final image remains clear, so artifacts do not touch closure directly but accumulate to −0.4 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and a lyric ear, but several artifact patterns accumulate: paraphrase loops ("Our journeys were not over; they had been interrupted" / "interrupted journeys braided into one long walk"), synonym churn around "interrupted" and "restless," and near-identical stems ("I carried," "I understood," "I realized"). Template-cadence runs appear in the middle third ("I thought of…," "I did it through…," "I carried it as if…"). Stock metaphors like "door opening slowly" and "hand in blessing" lack sharp specificity. Information density is high in places, but scaffold sentences ("So I…," "So we…") and minor redundancies (e.g., "shifted from fear to welcome" echoes prior "less like endings") dull momentum. No major clarity breaks, but combined texture issues prevent higher scoring and trigger the artifact penalty pack baseline (~−0.8 in Q7).

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally, with short declarative sentences ("Oona is gone") alternating with longer, imagistic lines. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and purposeful, building the futuristic-nostalgia tone without mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction ("exuberant colors that fade to strategies") fits the narrator's educated, specialized voice. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or pressure ("She would shift a star one stitch, and ink would bloom under heat"). Rhythm varies naturally, and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Clarity remains strong across spatial moves (dome → mural room → southern gatehouse → back beneath the dome). Minor deductions for figurative density in non-peak beats: "ghosts graze her patience," "seam picks apart a careless hem," "murmuring flock" cluster without pattern-teaching, and some metaphors strain coherence ("threading night into cloth as if mending weather" mixes vehicle logic). These artifacts do not touch the closure beat but accumulate across the middle third, applying −0.4 under the artifact penalty pack. Grammar and tense are clean; no pronoun ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose carries strong rhythmic control and vivid images: "his fingers curl toward mine like roots," "the break in me begins to stitch." However, template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "She says...she says...She says" in the final third creates a drumbeat that flattens momentum. Minor paraphrase loop: "I am here to find the moment before deciding" recurs verbatim without reweighting. The phrase "fierce tenderness" appears three times, twice as a label rather than embodied perception. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "apology gathers...like clouded glass" works, though "language our throats never learned" edges toward abstraction. No major artifacts touch the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high: most sentences do more than one job (e.g., "One side calls him kin and the other calls him proof" compresses conflict and stakes). Rhythm varies purposefully, especially in the decryption sequence where short clauses accumulate pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence across the full text. Weakness: "shrewdly innocent" recurs as both attribute and phrase three times without evolving meaning between uses, trending toward synonym churn. "Lotus-hearted ache" appears twice, once as label and once as action ("let the lotus-hearted ache open and gentle"), the second use rescuing the first. Figurative density is high in the opening third but thins under pressure, allowing clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent, but several metaphors stack without breathing room ("fog lapped…silvering it," "knowledge network hummed as if trees remembered how to rewind laughter," "pensive mirth wrapped the rows as if a shawl were knitted") in consecutive lines, triggering mild overwriting penalty (−0.4). A handful of recycled stems ("I wanted," "I knew," "I had," "I tried," "I let") create template cadence in the middle third (−0.3). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing lines anchor voice and closure. No loops or paraphrase; no clarity breaks. The figurative density and template runs are pervasive enough to prevent 8+ but do not obscure causality or dull the closure image, so deductions remain modest and routed here only.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high. No paraphrase loops or pronoun drift. Minor overwriting: "nested awakenings, each echo catching the next like a set of hands ready to raise a friend" stacks vehicles without adding pressure. Figurative density is high throughout ("cranes unfolding from paper sleep," "time flowers outward"), risking saturation in peak beats. Read-aloud ear test passes; no causality obscured. Modest deduction for decorative metaphor spread.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high; many lines do double duty (e.g., "mantises posed like green knives beside watering wands" anchors threat and setting). Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory specificity (gourd clicking, moths rehearsing) advances atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "joining community gardens to plant message patterns" recurs verbatim across three beats without added pressure, triggering −0.4. Template cadence in the collectors' sequence ("Ilya smiled…Ilya was candidly cryptic…Ilya shook the seed") adds −0.3. Figurative density in mid-story beats (amber iris, drummers warming up sky, ellipsis refusing to finish) occasionally obscures causal linkage, but clarity at closure (seed in envelope) remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and image density is high: "galaxy postcard drifted under my door like a tide leaf," "acoustics bow like trees in a salt wind," "sickles turned to harps." Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, two artifact patterns lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines—e.g., "The song threads the corridor, shyly unstoppable, tugging the wind to duty. / I sing our history..." and "Together we propose a season... / Together we write the blossom armistice"—the repeated "Together" and synonym churn dilute propulsion. (2) Template cadence in the final third: multiple sentences open with "The" or "We" or "I," creating a drumbeat rhythm ("The wind buries... The wind carries... Together we propose... Together we write... We store... I feel... My insomnia..."). The "shyly unstoppable" phrase recurs three times across the piece; while purposeful, the third instance feels decorative rather than earned. No loops touch the closure image directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 for paraphrase/template issues.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense, but several beats stack metaphors without clear vehicles: "foxglove regret in its rhythm" compresses poison/flower/meter unclearly; "ribbon staircases" and "weathered chambers" float without spatial grounding. Paraphrase loops appear ("She followed the sound… toward the old vestibule window. There hung the wind chime…" could compress). Template stems recur: "Room of X had Y; Room of Z had gone hoarse" reads list-like. High information density in many lines, but the final third introduces multiple new abstractions (mezzanine, stormfields, schoolyard comet) that slow closure momentum. No major causality breaks, so artifacts stay here.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense, with sentences often doing double work (e.g., "She lifted the glass ink well between us, as fragile and clear as a drop of intent" conveys object, gesture, and thematic charge). However, figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without relief: "lullabies of nations," "sweetened by our vows," "warm bread" cluster in the climax, blurring specificity. Template cadence appears in the vow sequence: "We wrote... We spoke... We continued... We sat..." (−0.4). Minor paraphrase loop: "to argue without abandoning" and "disagreements stitched so a seam offered strength" restate the same idea. No significant scaffold or pronoun drift; grammar is clean. Propulsion is steady but occasionally yields to ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Information density is high (most sentences advance character, discovery, or atmosphere). Figurative language is pervasive ("stone lung," "encrypted compassion," "slyly heartfelt metronome"), and while generally purposeful, it accumulates in high-pressure beats without always clarifying causality—e.g., "math and mercy arguing" is evocative but abstract at a pivot moment. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. One scaffold phrase: "When I laid the chain across the steps, the amphitheater hummed, and the pattern translated" uses passive discovery where active problem-solving might sharpen agency. Overall clean, with momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, stakes, or setting without padding. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. The metaphor chain around paper trails, echoes, and balance coheres without contradiction. Minor deductions: "blooming withering" as a coined term appears three times but only the final use reweights meaning; the middle mention feels slightly ornamental. A few near-paraphrase moments in the Mara backstory section ("She vanished… / …I claimed other towns and fathers") could compress further. No template cadence, loops, or artifacting. Clarity and propulsion remain strong through peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with purposeful compression: "wood remembers direction better than ink," "dust and weather" as memory anchors, "runway of wood" uniting pilot/carpenter motifs. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates (short declaratives at threshold, longer arcs in reflection). Minor overwriting: figurative language in most lines ("river where currents still run," "wet wing under cloud," "soft airport of the desk") approaches saturation without clear pattern-teaching payoff at closure. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold. One small register drift: "Resonant Reconfiguration" sensibility in "attention stretched across necessary distances" is slightly elevated but voice-recoverable. Clean grammar and tense.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose carries a lyric, incantatory rhythm with purposeful repetition ("softly ingenious," "luminous respite," "shadowseam wonder") that teaches a pattern. However, density issues accumulate: near-paraphrase loops ("We stood at the dome, held our lungs to the quiet, then released together" / "So we exhaled at the dome, and the shrimps pulsed back"), template cadence in descriptive beats, and stock metaphors ("the way fog folds into the first meadow after rain"). Figurative language appears in most sentences without always advancing pressure. "Captivate my doubt, folding it" mixes vehicle logic. Information density is moderate; some beats do double work (feather as talisman and tool), but scaffolding phrases ("It was all softly ingenious, like a lullaby") pad rather than propel. Clarity remains high; no orientation confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence, creating density that enriches texture but occasionally muddles propulsion. Mixed-vehicle moments: "eats footpaths like a tide eats castles" works, but "corridor blinked, then slid sideways with a sound like turning pages" conflates visual and auditory vehicles. Paraphrase loops are minimal; template cadence absent. Overwriting penalty (−0.4 for density in high-pressure beats) and one mixed-metaphor instance (−0.3) applied; no artifacts touch closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and often purposeful ("the sea had a metronome," "bodies drafting new lanes," "a blueprint dissolving into the organism it described"), but clusters in nearly every sentence, risking overwriting. Some vehicles contradict: "tuples of strangers" imports coding idiom without clear POV anchor, "diagonals offer the possibility that distance can be crossed without trespass" blurs spatial and ethical registers. Template cadence appears in "He asked her to choose… Then he asked her to choose" (acceptable as intentional parallelism). Clarity holds; no loops or causality breaks. Information density is high, with most lines advancing action or thematic texture. Pronoun references remain clean.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and many lines carry double duty: "Exile tastes like brine swallowed in winter, sharp, necessary" anchors both setting and interiority. However, the piece shows recurring template cadence—multiple paragraphs open with "I + verb" or "The + noun + verb" structures, creating a drumbeat that flattens momentum in the middle third. Figurative density is high throughout; nearly every sentence deploys metaphor, which in peak beats ("He forgets to speak, and in that unmade sentence I press the moonstone") can obscure the physical action sequence. No paraphrase loops, but "obsidian grace" appears three times without functional variation. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is densely imagistic and rhythmically controlled: "fog trumpet slowly up the ribs of the frame," "beam leapt into rainbows that wandered the interior, sampling ropes, fish scales, and boots." Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or pressure. However, several metaphors stack heavily in succession without breathing room—"glass greenhouse full of unplanted mornings," "star crack, as if some constellation fell and could not swim," "noctilucent reckonings rise over the bay like ledger columns glowing blue"—creating mild register drift and occasional opacity in the first third. The phrase "concentricities intersect, then travel, translating wind, worry, and chance into a legible ripple script" verges on overwriting. No loops or scaffold detected, and the ending image is crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece demonstrates strong figurative control in spots ("smoke etched into his pores," "moon threw its silver") and varies paragraph rhythm. However, repetitive sentence openings—"He climbed," "He had pulled," "He carried," "He opened," "He told," "He smiled," "He closed," "He felt," "He would"—create template cadence across the narrative spine. Several adjacent lines loop or paraphrase: "gently skilled at moving weight" recurs as "gently skilled fingers" and "gently skilled and scarred"; "hard softness" appears twice without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("ribbon crisped brown," "sky turned") and filter-verb stacks ("he wanted to," "he could not") dull immediacy in peak beats. These artifacts pervade enough to trigger accumulation penalties and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; paragraph structure modulates with pressure. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The grotto agreed, or I imagined it did; the patterns wavered and then clarified" carries world-building, interiority, and plot turn simultaneously). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. However, figurative density approaches overwriting in places: "the hush of a patient lung," "tern tracing wind," "mirrored currents," and "arithmetic curves" cluster within the opening third without pattern-teaching, creating mild register drift into elevated diction that occasionally obscures immediate causality (e.g., "let the sea wind solve for x" is evocative but mechanically vague). The final paragraph's "proof I loved most" and "theorem every timeline could share" risk thematic echo but stay anchored in scene (needle, chest, sea). Grammar and tense are clean; no pronoun ambiguity. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "She chose the collection over a man stranded on the stairs" seeds both backstory and moral calculus). However, paraphrase loops appear: "I discovered a fireplace... Inside its throat, half-burned pages" then immediately "I read the museum's memory through half-burned diaries found in a fireplace" restates the same discovery. Template cadence runs in the middle third: "I said... The wall agreed... I stepped inside... I followed... I realized..." clusters identical stems without pattern-teaching. These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats but do not obscure causality. No filter-verb stacks or stock metaphors in peak beats, and the final image is propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is densely figurative throughout—"swallows spooled their quiet," "a borrowed heartbeat ticked from a small brass locket, engine of an unshared story"—without teaching a pattern or paying it off at closure. Multiple sentences restate the same concept with synonym churn: "possibilities, not a promise" echoed in "bent obligation into choice and duty into dream." Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("They used no chalk, only their hands…"; "Will you lend a beat too, the painter asked…"). The final third accumulates abstractions ("a grafting of patience and hope," "a seam of brightness") that dull momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering elevated deductions and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("breath-clouds pressed to the wood, leaving ghost ovals that overlap like small continents," "the terrace…its cracked rail a smile missing teeth") and occasionally muddles clarity under pressure—"steam braid the air" compresses syntax awkwardly, and "breath rattles around the reed like a sparrow in a bell" stacks metaphor on metaphor in the closure beat. Template stems appear in beats 10–20 ("I ask…I ask…I speak…I tell…I set") applying −0.4. Mixed vehicle: "alignment has a seam…the seam will close like a wound" conflates spatial and medical images. Information density is strong elsewhere (each ritual gesture advances pressure), and no paraphrase loops obscure causality. Propulsion is steady but figurative load slows peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Sentence openings vary; rhythm accelerates and breathes with scene pressure. Two minor loops: "secretly sentimental" appears three times, once as label and twice embedded in action, creating slight redundancy. The phrase "the echo that vanishes first" and "the long hall of time collapsing when the singers stop returning" are adjacent restatements of the same idea; one could be cut. No scaffold or template cadence. Figurative language (salt as mirror, egg as unsent letter, chamber as throat) is coherent and voice-consistent. Opening and closing lines are strong: the taut sky and scored steps anchor the beginning; the thunder carrying the earlier song charges the end. Minor nitpick: "Threadlines converging beneath this salt" adds texture but does not tighten the beat as much as surrounding clauses.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, a paraphrase loop appears early: "She came for the harvest of echoes" / "Lira was here to defy the lullaby" restate intent without added pressure. Stock metaphors cluster: "blade of absence," "schools of fish turning," "pupil enters dawn." The final paragraph summarizes rather than compressing into one charged image, weakening propulsion. Minor filter-verb stack in the middle ("she let," "she drew," "she teased") without dramatic cost. No clarity breaks, but the density of figurative language in non-peak beats ("arteries under ice," "threads hummed an echo") slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify; information density is high (most lines do two jobs—sensory detail + interiority or action + theme). Minor loop at "He wrote Listen… then wrote it again" is functional repetition that illustrates the reversal motif. A few figurative phrases approach overwriting ("the dome curved overhead like a skullcap, gathering their earlier words and cooling them into fossils"), but they remain legible and thematically coherent. No scaffold or template cadence detected; clarity and propulsion hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic modulation. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, stake, or motif. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "I did not reach...I only steadied" / "I only wanted him to know" cluster in the monarch sequence, and "transiently rooted" is repeated verbatim twice without added pressure. Figurative language is dense ("sky felt like a library closing," "wingbeat, then the missing answer") but mostly coherent. No major clarity breaks, though the final third could tighten two lines of summary ("signals are not monuments") that restate prior showing.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; figurative language (aurora as spectral brass, ice tinkling like bells, organ opening like a lung) generally serves pressure without overwriting. Minor deductions: a few adjacent lines risk paraphrase loops ("The sanctum did not demand penance anymore; it asked only..." echoes the structure of "after forgiving yourself the world does not vanish; it brightens"). Filter-verb usage ("I had thought that scar an accusation") is light. Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings shift appropriately. Clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances image, choice, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with pressure (short bursts during seal-breaking, longer breath during collective moment). Clarity remains strong across complex metaphors. Two pattern issues lower the score: synonym churn around "path" / "directive" / "order" in the middle third creates mild conceptual looping, and several participial openers ("counting," "gathering," "pressing") in sequential paragraphs produce template cadence. No muddy metaphors or filter-verb stacks, and the final image propels cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence openings diversify across the piece. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "a river of ash where constellations once glowed," "their histories were joining budgets to avoid collapse." Two localized slips: "It was an empirically ironic faith" borders on thesis statement, and "the passage did not open with miracle, but with the practiced thrift of doors long kept" repeats the frugality motif without advancing pressure. Minor paraphrase loop: "he spoke with the unknown" is restated as "he began to speak with the unknown" within three paragraphs. Template cadence appears in the sequence "He drew…not predicting…only offering…to ensure," but does not pervade. Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or ritual progress.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high with layered imagery, but several prose artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("She had held a man so he could die faster, and her throat had wanted to keep him instead" restates what cellular memory just revealed), template cadence in the ritual sequence ("I called it...I reached for...I felt the..."), and elevated diction clusters ("limned," "braided but unbroken," "tremble passing through me") that occasionally obscure momentum. The broken pin as recurring concrete anchor works well. Figurative language density in the opening and ritual beats borders on overwriting without clear pattern-teaching, though the sanctuary's dust-to-rivers transformation is specific and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("apple skeletons leaned like ribs," "fog threading them into corridors") but appears in nearly every sentence, risking overwriting without relief. Template cadence is evident in repeated "He [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems across multiple beats. Some paraphrase loops appear: "erasing boundaries" recurs as both phrase and concept without added pressure. Clarity holds and no mixed metaphors break logic, but the uniform elevated register and lack of propulsion variance during key beats (e.g., the dream's arrival and Iren's offering) flatten momentum. Sentence openings and paragraph lengths vary minimally. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (image + character motive) but scaffold phrasing ("He had studied," "He wanted to capture") pads early exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies effectively and information density is high—most lines layer action, memory, and metaphor without padding. Figurative language is dense but mostly legible: "bark" for the daughter's feistiness, "deciduous vows," "breach grown leaves." Minor overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("arguments bright and brittle as new leaves") and a few filter-verb clusters ("I said," "they asked"). The ribbon beats are propulsive and concrete. Two adjacent lines near the middle paraphrase the vows concept without added pressure (−0.2), and template cadence in dialogue tags appears briefly (−0.3). No loops touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.3)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("leaves of faint aurora," "petals edited the air," "seeds small as commas"), but patterns are taught early and cohere with the lyric-surreal premise. Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Two minor loop artifacts: "I decided to return and make no choice except attention" followed shortly by "Back under the aurora leaves, I will inquire of the roots" rephrases intent without advancing pressure, and "brightened disquiet" recurs decoratively. Information density is strong overall, and the closure image remains clear. Apply −0.3 for the paraphrase loop, landing mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("grammar frays when the mountain slopes into memory"). Information density is strong—most lines do multiple jobs. However, runs of similar syntactic stems appear in the middle third ("I touch...I ask...I write...I feel") and a few metaphors stack without full integration ("shelves that hum like beehives of paper" works; "a chord never struck but vibrating" is elegant; together they risk slight overwriting in the final beat). No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks. Propulsion remains steady through the rescue sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "fog parting in ribs through which moonwater poured," "rides slept under nets like drowned stars." Information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs. However, several metaphors strain coherence: "pocket storms" (how do pockets generate weather?), "unmarked soil shivered awake" (soil shivering reads imprecise), and "blossoms carried chalked letters that dusted our wrists" (the physical mechanism is unclear). The phrase "trapped freedom" recurs without sufficient grounding to make the paradox concrete. Minor template cadence in the middle third: "I followed… I wound… I answered…" across adjacent beats. These accumulate to −0.9 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high: most lines do double duty (archive clues, tactile engagement, conceptual framing). Rhythm modulates well between catalog passages and mechanism-room immersion. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The fables of absence said you listen for the space around a fact, not only the fact itself" is restated by "listen for the space around a fact" earlier, and "confusion breathes / clarity takes the air" recycles the confusion/clarity binary without new pressure. Template cadence runs emerge in the middle third ("I checked the escapement, I checked the weight drums, I checked my own pulse"). These artifacts accumulate to −0.6 in Q7 and, because they appear in a high-pressure sequence, disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, and stakes simultaneously—and the rhythm modulates with pressure (short declaratives at peak moments: "I knelt and read"; longer, layered sentences during reflective beats). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally. Minor deduction for occasional figurative density that risks opacity: "the hush gathered until it carried a fragrance like frost bitten thyme" stacks metaphor (bloom, fragrance, frost-bitten) in rapid succession, and "weather that refuses to break" followed immediately by "weather that loved us" shifts the vehicle without clear transition. The final paragraph's syntactic parallelism ("I am a mapkeeper… the cave mapped us") is purposeful and lands cleanly. Overall line-level control is strong with no artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances setting, character, or stake. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is mostly coherent. However, minor overwriting appears: "thin music over ruins and salt" and "a river discovering a forgotten braid" stack metaphors without clear vehicles, and the opening third carries slight density surplus ("the beacon-tower custodian Kera" is clean, but "retroactively blessed, cursed, some said" adds modest hedging). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. These slips do not touch closure, capping deduction at −0.4 per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity and rhythm are strong; sentence openings vary and figurative language is controlled. However, paraphrase loops appear: "I speak both into the crystal whispering forecourt after rain, and I feel the hush gather" closely echoes prior descriptions of the forecourt's function, and "the deepening hush" recurs without new pressure in several beats. Template cadence is minimal but present in mid-section list-like transitions ("Here the shadows double…there they split"). Information density is moderate; several lines ("I have carried too much alone, fearing…") summarize interiority that could be compressed. The closure beat avoids artifacts, capping deductions at −0.8 per the non-closure cap.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid ("luminous seeds that hovered slow as moths"), but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without respite, creating decorative density rather than propulsion. Paraphrase loops are minimal, yet template cadence emerges in repeated structures ("he chants while walking… she twirled unlit flame"; "filter… filtering… filter"). Register drift into poetic abstraction ("argument against despair," "articulation," "ledger of what it could carry") occurs frequently, obscuring concrete action. Line-level clarity is adequate, but overwriting in high-pressure beats (the launch sequence) reduces momentum and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives at the peak choice ("I said, I do not know if I will stay") contrast with longer lyric arcs earlier. Information density is high; nearly every line advances image, stakes, or interiority. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deductions: elevated metaphoric density in the opening third (drip/hush, braille in water, throat of rock, slick of a star) occasionally slows momentum without pattern-teaching, and one near-synonym pair ("letting our words fade" / "the silence spilled") in adjacent beats. The closure beat is clean and propulsive. Within-band penalty totals −0.4 for density and one redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, interiority, metaphor). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at peak beats ("open the doll fully and let the bunker note breathe with the gilded one"). Minor scaffold appears: "I learned," "I call," "I realize" stems recur in adjacent paragraphs, creating template cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "intangibly tangible" reads oxymoronic without clear grounding, and "dew bells...float like seeds" mixes vehicles slightly. One paraphrase loop: "claustrophobic child" and "his corridors shrank my breath" restate the same constraint. No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high: most sentences advance atmosphere and character. However, multiple paraphrase loops weaken propulsion: "in the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" appears twice; "monitoring noise levels" is repeated with "I monitor the corridor" and "my hands kept monitoring noise levels"; "the hush" and "silence" are synonym-churned across adjacent beats without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("I adjusted... I dimmed... I told... I set...") flattens momentum. Storm-glass description ("blooms with feathered crystals," "knit spiky snow," "softened to filigree") stacks figurative language densely without pattern-teaching, triggering the overwriting density check. Applying −0.6 for loops and −0.4 for template stems (−1.0 cumulative under the patterned-artifact penalty pack), plus −0.3 for figurative density in one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent: "kaleidoscopic waterfall," "ruby flake…shard of heat-fused sand," "throne…a radio made of rain." Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is strong across beats. However, multiple lines repeat conceptual content without adding pressure: "the orchard spoke…Go…sally to the root-room" paraphrases the prior flake guidance, and "stewardship began where the unclaimed throne listened" restates the conceptual shift already shown. Template cadence appears in mid-section description: "I set…I pressed…I climbed" across adjacent beats. No paraphrase loops touch the closure image, capping deduction at −0.4. Syntax and openings vary; no filter-verb stacks or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("loaded emptiness," "listening was another kind of breathing," "suffocating the way shame suffocates"), creating a persistent lyric density that slows momentum and obscures cause-effect linkage at key beats. The teaching sequence—"In for four, stay for four, out for six"—offers concrete instruction, yet surrounding lines loop metaphorically ("trembled at the staying, because staying felt like drowning disguised as patience") without advancing the action. Template cadence appears in the opening third: "I am the tender shadow keeper… I am one who burns bridges…" Stack of declarative "I am" stems signals scaffold. Paraphrase loops recur: "suffocating to breathe" appears twice within three paragraphs. Deductions: −0.6 for figurative density across high-pressure beats, −0.4 for template cadence, −0.2 for paraphrase loop = −1.2 total in Q7, placing the score in the upper 5-band.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every beat ("lantern dust," "patient tide," "raindrop made stubborn"), creating atmospheric density but dulling propulsion in high-pressure moments—chamber entry and the bead's formation deserve sharper clarity. Paraphrase loops appear: "pressure is patient" / "patient tide"; "quantum promise" recurs without functional variation. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "I [verb]" or "The [noun]" across adjacent lines. Information density is high, but metaphoric stacking in peak beats (e.g., "grammar could rive carbon into crystal") obscures the physical sequence. No major causality breaks, but momentum suffers under ornamental weight. Artifacts touch the closure third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several lines veer into overwriting that obscures rather than clarifies: "golden shadows thickened as if to bear witness" and "standing waves decayed like candle smoke returning to wax" strain the metaphor. The phrase "nostalgia of shells people use instead of hearts" is abstract and disrupts momentum. Minor template cadence appears in paired constructions ("She had lost me the throne… They called me dynasty ender…"). Information density is high, but the accumulation of figurative language in most sentences of high-pressure beats (portrait opening, plate blooming) risks opacity without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high and often purposeful ("syrup," "vines bent like vines," "strings meet finger joints"), but several lines loop or paraphrase: "unsnapped the seal" / "unsnapping old closures" / "unsnap what armor remained" recycles the same image without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("He saw," "He understood," "He realized," "He reached") in the final third, flattening propulsion. Mixed metaphors emerge: "vellum that gleamed like rain" bearing "dust thick as regret," and "air brightened not in light but in meaning" abstracts rather than grounds. Minus −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems in closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (the button description conveys both object and Alvarez's care). Rhythm varies purposefully, and the final paragraph's longer breath supports closure. Two craft issues lower the score: (1) minor paraphrase loops ("small kindnesses" appears three times with synonym churn: "magnify," "gestures that kept a day from failing," "proof that a man once fixed a coat"); (2) occasional filter-verb stacks in reflective beats ("I remember," "I do not read," "I say"). These artifacts appear in non-closure beats, so the cap at 8.7 does not apply, but they reduce propulsion in mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is ambitious and imagistic—"auric lagoon," "advertisements peeled like molting snakes," "starlight dripped through grates"—with strong rhythmic variety. However, density overload in peak beats (the relay chamber, the lagoon flare) layers metaphor without always advancing action: "the auric water flared, and for a breath the lagoon mirrored not the stars but the erased" is evocative but syntactically dense when clarity would sharpen momentum. Paraphrase loops appear ("a map suggested by puddle reflections at dusk" recurs twice; "coded freedom" appears three times without functional shift). Minor filter-verb stacks ("watched," "felt," "studied") and template cadence in the middle third ("She knelt... She fitted... She moved") reduce propulsion, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm and imagery are vivid and purposeful: "breath borrowed from sleeping reeds," "a throat of stone and light," "oval fits the atrium's prism." Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, action, or theme. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, creating cumulative density that occasionally slows propulsion in the middle third (e.g., "ferns silvered by drip, their filigree trembling with bright caution" stacks metaphor without altering stakes). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor friction: the extended poetic mode risks overwriting in a few beats where a simpler anchor would sharpen clarity, but the closure image ("hear only water remembering how to fall") remains clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is extremely high: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("patient whale made of wood," "frostbitten firefly," "soft comets sketching relief"). In peak beats (Moonstone flare, drawer-emptying), the ornamental phrasing competes with action clarity—"the monument rang like spring" decorates rather than clarifies the arbor's response. Template cadence appears in paired clauses: "he would prod... he knew... he listened... he adjusted." Paraphrase loops: "building tiny monuments" recurs across paragraphs without added pressure. Information density is moderate; many lines perform one job (describe) rather than advancing multiple threads. No major causality breaks, but momentum drags under metaphor weight.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with most lines doing multiple jobs: "moss silvered the walls, and a river stole light from a crack above" anchors setting and light source while advancing spatial descent. Rhythm varies purposefully—short clauses during machine assembly, longer breaths in retrospective opening. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor figurative density in the cavern section: "breathing cool like a hidden lung," "folded time like cloth," "spoke in drips and thuds, a grammar of perhaps" cluster within four paragraphs without clear pattern-teaching, approaching but not crossing overwriting threshold. Propulsion is strong; scaffolding is minimal. One stock phrase: "the color green grown tired of itself" risks cleverness over clarity but remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (image, metaphor, character stance). Rhythm varies purposefully with short declaratives anchoring longer lyric sweeps. Figurative density is heavy but mostly coherent ("names fall heavy when they are all that remains, heavier than steel if guilt is the flux"). Deductions: minor paraphrase loop between "I work to understand the weight of names" and "Names fall heavy when they are all that remains"; elevated diction in a few peak beats ("luminous regret," "jealous arithmetic") reads slightly ornamental. No loops or scaffold touch the closure beat, which remains propulsive and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "spectral confessions were treasures and burdens, gleaming as they bruised"). Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Clarity holds under figurative load. Minor density spike: the final third stacks metaphors ("thin silver of sound like grass singing beneath ice," "air brightened like milk poured into tea") without rest, though none muddle causality. No loops or scaffold. The closure image ("small river under my tongue") lands cleanly. Pronoun references are unambiguous throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character (trauma archive), setting (pollen hum), or theorem. Rhythm modulates (short clauses during trauma spasms, longer syntactic arcs during reflection). Zero paraphrase loops; figurative language (echolocation unfolding, shiver writing date) is coherent and sparse. Minor deduction: two adjacent lines near the pool ("I lean over and the water gives me a face I do not fully trust, a face that survived because it learned to impersonate stone") edge toward metaphor stacking without full payoff in the next beat.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("sky-bound river," "anchors of intuition sharp as hooks"), but several metaphors strain clarity: "bruised whites begin to breathe," "soot-sweet laughter," "silvery marginal weather." Template cadence appears in repeated "I [verb]" stems across the opening third. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the phrase "elusively tangible" recurs four times without accumulating pressure. Information density is strong in the translation beats; momentum sags in the reflective asides ("between childhood and now" appears three times). Figurative language in nearly every sentence of the canvas-examination beat (midpoint) risks overwriting without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the discovery beats. Clarity is generally strong, but several lines tip into figurative excess: "cotton candy without a stick," "agreements make ghosts hungrier than finales," "a nick in brass." The dust-reading sequence is crisp and propulsive. Minor loops: "light as" appears twice in close succession ("light as invoices forgiven," "shoulders light, burden light"). The final paragraph stacks metaphors ("steam," "invoices," "habit") without all landing cleanly. No major scaffold or template cadence, but the figurative density in non-peak beats slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances metaphor, stakes, or image. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph rhythm creates visual breath. Figurative language is dense but purposeful, though the final third approaches saturation: "every second stood up like wheat and bowed like wheat and died like wheat" risks ornamental stacking. Clarity remains legible under the lyric mode, with no paraphrase loops or template cadence. One minor slip: "the sea of clouds shifted its spine" followed closely by "a roused archive shaking off its dustless sleep" introduces slight vehicle drift. The piece earns its accumulative texture, but closure-beat density prevents entry to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.9)
    Density is high with lines often doing double duty (e.g., "defunct revolutionary" anchors both backstory and present stance). Sentence openings vary and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, the piece exhibits mild paraphrase loops: "poetically inclined" appears three times with near-identical framing, and "burnished sorrow" recurs four times without enough functional shift between uses. Template cadence is absent, but the figurative load is heavy in peak beats (the second shard tableau, the storm sequence) with stacked metaphors that occasionally blur clarity ("time strings itself," "seconds walk like tame animals," "histories bloom into luminous scripts" within ~8 lines). Apply −0.6 for loops and metaphor density in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density pervades without clear pattern-teaching: "bruise in the harmonics," "bell held shut by a thumb," "apology as a collar," "turning a page underwater" stack metaphors in adjacent lines, creating coherence strain under pressure. Paraphrase loop: "He would listen for the future crack… and stitch it closed" repeats the mending-what-isn't-torn concept already established. Template cadence: "He lifted… He built… He wound… He played…" across four consecutive beats in the drum sequence (−0.4). Information density is high—most lines advance image and action—but the lyric register obscures causal sequencing (how does the scale "become" a keyhole?). No severe clarity breaks at closure, capping deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and often purposeful ("needle freeing like a tiny hinge pin," "throat leading to a subterranean lagoon"), but several beats stack metaphors without clear propulsion: "resonant hush" recurs five times, and "hinged awakenings" is invoked thrice without evolving mechanics. The opening sentence ("After the factory shuts down, I return to the cliffs as a sensibly eccentric petrichor collector with a notebook and empty vials") front-loads four descriptors where two would anchor faster. Minor paraphrase loop: "the resonant hush" appears in sequential paragraphs with near-identical framing.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("salt-white world hummed like turbines," "crib for shelter shaped like a listening ear"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or concept. However, patterned overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the middle third carries metaphor or poetic inversion, creating a relentless lyric texture that occasionally obscures action sequence (e.g., "hammering pebbles with palms until nails remember their purpose" is evocative but mechanically vague). The final third contains mild paraphrase loops ("perpetually learning to scaffold complexity" appears twice in close succession) and the closing paragraph's repeated exposition of the village plan recycles concepts. No grammar errors; clarity holds at closure, so artifact penalties stay moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; lyric cadence fits the reflective lens. Information density is high: most lines advance observation, setting, or thematic layering. Clarity is generally strong, though some figurative density approaches overwriting: "the whole place filled with an umbral tenderness that gentled the stone" stacks metaphor without muddle but nears saturation. Two minor loops: "opening" recurs across several beats (flowers opening, glass opening paths, petals opening inward) without always adding new pressure. No major scaffold or template cadence; no filter-verb stacks. Propulsion slows slightly in the middle third as the artist cycles through postcards and dawn/dusk observation without escalation, but the closure image recovers momentum. Proofreading is clean; no pronoun drift or tense errors.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, with many lines doing double duty (e.g., "He could not climb the gangway, so we lowered a sling, and he rose toward the zeppelin like a stubborn buoy refusing to sink" fuses logistics and characterization). Clarity is sustained across the complex decryption sequence. However, decorative figuration saturates several beats without pattern-teaching or payoff: "truth was a muscle and pain was how it learned to move," "the past stopped shouting and started humming," and "truth needs friction to shine" stack metaphor-as-thesis in high-pressure moments, reducing propulsion. Minor template cadence appears in paired participial constructions ("smelling of brine…smelling of dry glue…both smelling of"), and the phrase "obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes" recurs as an unvaried anchor four times, edging toward loop.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "the cove answers with the softest applause, tide over shingle" provides sound, rhythm, and thematic resonance). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (lantern as grammar, bottle as lens/discipline/constraint). Two frictions: (1) paraphrase loop between "jugs that never open" and "bottle with no opening" across adjacent beats; (2) template cadence in paragraph 18-20 with repeated "he [verb]" stems. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. The phrase "ghost stage where gulls write cursive no one answers" exemplifies the piece's high textural control.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The shaving remembers, and memory has teeth like moths; it eats holes that spell unlikely constellations of sound"). No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Figurative density is heavy but mostly coherent. Minor deduction: the simile "the way a cat rubs against a book and makes it smell like a promise" in a high-pressure beat (the prophecy moment) slightly dilutes urgency; one or two other metaphors ("city fog rests below like a down comforter") are textural rather than propulsive, creating minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character knowledge, or the unlock attempt. Rhythm modulates effectively ("The shell parts with a lace of steam, and a small throat finds the night"). Some overwriting in stacked figurative language: "Starlight needles through the cracked dome as the icebound atrium breathes a brittle hush" front-loads three metaphors in one beat. Template cadence appears in mid-section ("I hold...I came...I press...I send") but does not obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; pronoun references remain clear. The final image ("ridiculous and solemn") earns its tonal complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm modulates purposefully ("The sanctuary breathed, the ropes quieted, and the storm split with the dignity of a river finding two beds"). Minor deductions: "quiet crown the day" is a strained metaphor; "the city kept its heart rate" mixes vehicle (body) with setting in a way that blurs sense. "Credibly curious, the sort who asked the bell rope how it knew the weather" loops conceptually with the prior paragraph's claim without added pressure. No major scaffold or template cadence, but a few figurative reaches in high-density passages.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high: most lines layer image, action, and thematic charge ("the sky wasting itself in sparks, and every hiss teaches patience to my bruised ribs"). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph rhythm breathes. Minor figurative density in mid-passage: "river that says, hush, go with the drag of gravity" and "muscle of quiet that flexes the sky" cluster without muddling sense, but the accumulation slightly slows momentum before the crew arrives. No loops or scaffolding. A few elevated constructions ("primal elegance," "flourishing stillness") repeat the core concept without variation, risking template echo, but the specificity of chalk-and-ozone anchors prevent full drift. Propulsion is steady, not urgent, fitting the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. High information density: most lines do double work (e.g., "stained glass box buried where wild thyme wrestled with ash" conveys object, location, and ecological tension). Figurative language is dense—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction—but remains coherent and legible under the taught lyric mode. However, the phrase "through contextual clues" recurs three times in identical stem position, approaching template cadence; the repetition serves thematic echo but risks monotony. Stock constructions like "a tide of translucence" and "scorch halos" are vivid but border on ornamental. No paraphrase loops or clarity breaks at closure. Propulsion is steady; the piece breathes rather than accelerates, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high—most lines layer image, action, and thematic charge—and rhythm varies purposefully (short crisis beats: "It clicked like bone understanding bone"; longer reflective runs in the middle). Minor loop: "suddenly timeless" appears twice in similar phrasing (paragraphs 14 and 33), and "embedding messages in garage sale item descriptions" recurs verbatim across three paragraphs without tonal shift, totaling a −0.2 paraphrase penalty. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; no mixed metaphors or register breaks mar the closure beat. One pronoun ambiguity: "their" in "returning names to their owners" briefly unclear after "coins" and "owners" both plural, resolved by context within the line.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously ("My small satchel carries paper, twine, and a drake's tail feather, found near the reeds when the storm relented"). Rhythm varies purposefully, with sentence length modulating between lyric extension and clipped urgency ("Then the gust twists strange"). Minor deductions: paraphrase loop in "The boy whoops as the kite climbs, the father laughs" followed immediately by "When the wind returns, we do not fight it" (adjacent beats restating collaborative stance), and template cadence in several "I [verb]" openings across the piece. Filter-verb density ("I watch," "I feel," "I think") accumulates but remains voice-motivated rather than artifactual. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives ("Some caretakers pray; I remodel") alternate with longer, layered constructions that mirror the orchard's complexity. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The diary was my map, my confession, and the fuse to architectural secrets" establishes function, tone, and stakes). Clarity remains strong; spatial choreography tracks cleanly (storm → pillar shift → chamber → seeds → pact proposal → final stance). Minor issues: two paraphrase loops appear—"I tied copper wire…felt a tremor" echoed closely by "The pillar unlatched another palm of stone" in adjacent beats, and "The orchard answered with those soft clicks" nearly restates the prior image of roots breaking stone softly. Template cadence in mid-section: several paragraphs open with "I [verb]" or "The [noun]" stems across sequential lines ("I sat…I took…I told…I walked"), creating a slight drum-beat that flattens micro-rhythm during the diary-writing sequence. These artifacts do not touch the closure beat (which varies syntax cleanly: "So I finished…Then I began…") and the figurative language remains coherent ("copper lines twinkling," "orchard and temple traded breaths"). Applying −0.6 for template stems and paraphrase loops in Q7 only, per the artifact pack, with no bleed to Q2 since causality remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines serve character, atmosphere, and thematic accumulation. Rhythm varies purposefully between compressed observations and expansive sensory beats. Minor scaffold appears in template stems: "We [verb]" pattern runs through the middle third without full payoff. Some figurative language dense-packs ("rain polished its stones until the sky seemed baked inside") but remains legible. No paraphrase loops or pronoun drift. Sentence openings vary. The "bronze quiet" motif recurs with purpose. One small clarity slip: "membranes flexing" gestures at alien physiology without grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and thematic weight ("Dead reef to feed the living shore; fallen bone to brace a sprout with remembering"). Minor repetition ("the blooming jetty at twilight" recurs in opening and near-close) is pattern-taught and charges the final image. One paraphrase loop mid-piece: "I speak dead languages to them" and "I speak again, this time in a dead port-argot" restate without added pressure, triggering −0.2. No figurative muddle in peak beats; metaphors (grammar, sentence, signature) cohere across the arc. Clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is pervasive: most sentences in high-pressure beats layer metaphor without pattern-teaching or lyric payoff that directly charges closure ("grooves of a phonograph cylinder" is literal, but surrounding lines like "hush inside the hush" and "wild hush again" loop conceptually). Template cadence appears in repeated stems: "He said... He spoke... He drew..." and "I set... I copied... I pressed..." across adjacent paragraphs. Paraphrase loops surface in "translate distance into closeness" (paragraph 6) and "translated distance into closeness" (paragraph 38), restating the same content. Mixed metaphor: "wasteland, a longer throat for our voices" pairs organic and spatial vehicles without clear coherence. Information density is high in the phonograph and water-discovery beats, but scaffold phrasing ("a riddle laid softly," "a hinge for the door of doubt") adds texture without advancing causality. No catastrophic opacity, but cumulative artifacts dull momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances setting, stakes, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is mostly coherent. Two points of friction: the phrase "temporally stretched by residual gradients" and "temporal drag" echo each other conceptually across adjacent paragraphs, a mild paraphrase loop. The compass rose description recurs but with shifting function, so no penalty there. A few sentences approach overwriting ("Its halves unlocking like a jaw unclenched"), yet clarity remains intact and none touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "wind scraped our faces like a patient file" anchors sensation and introduces the medical-precision motif). No paraphrase loops or major scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is dense ("colors bled into wrong constellations," "secrets fluttered out like snow moths") but mostly coherent. Two slips: "sacredly playful" appears three times as a descriptor without evolving function, trending toward template repetition; "swapping hand-carved chess pieces with secrets inside" is repeated verbatim twice, creating mild synonym-loop effect. These do not touch closure but accumulate to −0.8 under the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Figurative density is high but mostly controlled; however, several adjacent lines layer metaphor without causal propulsion ("echo," "phosphoresce," "luminous absence," "ledger of breaths" cluster in opening third). Sentence variety strong; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. One scaffold moment: "I understood and unbound the red cord entirely" tells the understanding rather than showing the micro-choice. Information density solid overall, with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. Final image ("dome held them as a lantern holds the idea of fire") lands cleanly without muddle, keeping closure untouched by artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, paraphrase loops appear: "He says the map I carry is wrong, and that maps are only apologies for rooms we have not yet claimed" followed by "He substitutes reality nightly, he confides, trading aisles like constellations" reads as synonym churn without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("He teaches me," "He tells me," "He says," "He guides my hand") stacks similar stems across four beats. Mixed metaphor: "letters lift as temperature, syntax as wind" then "geometry of pulse, edges as breathing, rooftops as skins" layers vehicles without clear coherence. The artifacts do not obscure closure but dull momentum in the middle third, triggering −0.6 for template runs and −0.3 for paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance image, choice, or thematic pressure. Rhythm modulates well: long sentences for the frozen hush, short bursts when the tutor acts ("I tied the knot"). No paraphrase loops detected. Minor template cadence in the thread-tying sequence (three successive "I [verb]" constructions) slightly dulls momentum but does not obscure causality. Figurative language is dense ("hush was woven hush, threads across the day") yet legible; no mixed metaphors. The final line ("ready to teach any child the opening called mercy") lands with clarity and charge. Grammar and pronoun references remain clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; sentences often do double work (setting and emotion, action and theme). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at the confrontation. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Some figurative language clusters in exposition ("forged hush," "breath and bone," "trapdoors") but remains coherent and supports the lyric mode. Minor deductions: a few elevated constructions in peak beats ("refract rather than resolve our chorus") approach overwriting, and "the fear that comes when you realize your rules are too small" tilts toward explanation. Syntax and word choice remain strong and specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and most lines advance situation or charge imagery. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose carries momentum through the dive-surface cycle. However, several paraphrase loops and synonym chains appear: "meaning was not found but forged" / "conjure meaning" recurs without added pressure; "the seams are where the warmth lives" / "golden seams to hold him" / "lined with brightness" cycles the same metaphor. Template cadence in the middle third ("He would dip... He would rise... He heard... He set...") flattens propulsion. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (crucible, vein, artery, constellation, quilts) approaches overwriting, though metaphors remain internally consistent. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template stems, touching but not obscuring the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift across fragments, clauses, and full declaratives. Information density is high: most lines advance character, image, and thematic charge. Minor template cadence in the cave sequence ("I took," "I walked," "I set," "I rinsed," "I balanced," "I painted") pulls momentum slightly (−0.4). No paraphrase loops or stock metaphors; figurative language ("salt," "fishscale," "blade of day") remains coherent and voice-motivated. Closure lines ("Light from the harbor climbed the wall like a tide seeking my canvas") are propulsive and image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening long breath ("After the heat wave breaks, the cobalt lighthouse at dawn stands breathing like a great blue lung") gives way to shorter tactical beats when the skiff approaches. Information density is high: most lines do two jobs (e.g., "I wipe salt from the brass and hum a note to wake the old steps" = action + worldview). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and POV-anchored. Two friction points lower the score: (a) "vibrations of intent" and "screaming tenderness that does not injure air" edge toward conceptual opacity in peak beats without full dramatic grounding, risking slight register drift (−0.3); (b) one paraphrase slip: "Whispers are not just quiet sounds; they are vibrations of intent" follows a paragraph already establishing that whispers "gather…into something that can cross water," creating minor redundancy (−0.2). Grammar and sequencing are clean; no loops or scaffold elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density and purposeful rhythm: "After the hydraulics fail, I learn the math of cranks and patience, and I become the missing motor with my body." Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and rooted in the narrator's technical-mystical idiom. Minor overwriting in adjacent beats: "The dish will not swivel, so I strip the cradle and rig a counterweight" followed immediately by "My relic is a patina bronze censer foot…Its weight remembers smoke" recycles the counterweight concept without new pressure (paraphrase-loop penalty −0.2). One mixed vehicle: "raw solace that tastes like salt" after "whispering backward" water—sensory blend unclear. No scaffold or template cadence detected; sentence openings vary and propulsion holds.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully: longer braided clauses in exposition, shorter beats at the burial decision. Minor loop: "rational" recurs five times across the piece without reweighting each use. A handful of filter verbs ("planned," "studied," "hated") are voice-motivated but cluster in the first half. One scaffold instance: "I am a rational truffle forager, methodical about spores and seasons, suspicious of charms" reads slightly list-like. No major opacity or propulsion stalls; the closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift purposefully. Information density is high—most lines advance character perception, investigation mechanics, or thematic weight. No major loops or paraphrase detected. Clarity holds across the accumulative structure. Minor deductions: some figurative vehicles crowd adjacent lines without breathing space ("mist made the harbor a page erased," "borrowed memories the way a neighbor lends a cup with a crack," "gaps are the letters of the tide" all land within a short span), which slightly dilutes each image's charge. Filter verbs ("I wanted to decode," "I decided to investigate") cluster in early setup but do not dull peak beats. The final image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative density is high and largely coherent ("surviving stars," "ink returning to its well," "light slain by the cliff"), but occasional vehicles crowd: "column of ants," "seam of water," "routes of selves knotted like ant roads" compress multiple images in close succession without always clarifying the mechanics. "Listening ferns" and "approving elders" personify without clear POV motivation. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with pressure. No loops or scaffolding. Information density is strong. The high metaphor load in the cavern sequence (the story's climax) risks slight opacity: "readable pressure on the world" is evocative but abstract. Deduction totals −0.6 for density and one mixed vehicle ("routes knotted like ant roads returning to origin" conflates map/knot/ant-road without stable tenor), keeping the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Information density is high—most lines do two jobs (advance atmosphere and character state). A handful of figurative overlaps in the cobalt-vault passage ("bleeding starlight," "liquid cloth," "filigree that weighed like threat") cluster without full causal payoff, and "lacy menace" appears three times across the arc but does not constrain a mid-story choice, reducing propulsion slightly. Grammar and tense remain clean. The final image ("simply watched the dusk polish the stones") lands with quiet authority but sacrifices kinetic momentum for lyric resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively ("The ember nexus at twilight hums" / "twilight finally exhales, and the ember nexus sleeps"). Information density is high; most lines advance ritual, character, or atmosphere. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without always adding clarity: "spiral draws heat into grammar," "laps tell me the old coefficients cherished fear," "presence compresses, warm as a held breath, dense as freshly poured grain." Mixed vehicles occasionally clash (heat into grammar; coefficients cherishing fear). A paraphrase loop appears in "I want to capture the density of presence, not its rumor. / I want mass you can feel in the wristbones while you speak." Template cadence in the palette sequence ("Another reads Patience... another, Mercy") is minor but present. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in the middle third. Applying patterned-artifact baseline −0.6 and figurative density −0.4 for cumulative effect totaling −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The rings were still in it, pale scars of seasons, a calendar that never learned digits" anchors object, time, and voice). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in action beats and breathing in reflection. Zero paraphrase loops. Minor deductions: "I envied the kid who hiked without checking weather, the surveyor who sang, the lover who carried cinnamon" is a brief list, and "feral nostalgia prowled the room, sniffing…It bit when I looked" stacks two figurative moves in close succession. The final third sustains clarity and propulsion without scaffold, lifting the score. Still, figurative density in several beats (thermals humming, wind fretting, stones listening) approaches but does not cross the overwriting threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high and most lines advance character or atmosphere. Sentence rhythm modulates appropriately (short declaratives during the repair, longer reflection in the opening). Two distinct issues lower the score: moderate figurative density in the opening third ("air moves like careful hands," "stories pool if someone waits beside them," "rain learning to speak") lacks pattern-teaching and risks overwriting, triggering −0.6; and one paraphrase loop near midpoint ("I do not argue... He saved me... He found me... He said") adds scaffold without pressure, triggering −0.2. The artifacts do not touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits the combined penalty to −0.8, but the spread across multiple paragraphs prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the ritual's stakes). Figurative language ("saturated hush," "lattice that crystallizes when stressed," "stories stepped through and found perches") is vivid and mostly coherent, though density approaches the threshold in the mid-section without quite crossing into overwriting. One register drift: "I reached backward through time, by revisiting youthful superstitions" leans slightly expository and academic for the protagonist's voice under peak stress, though it remains legible (−0.3 in Q7). Clarity is high; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the motif of storms and the crow quill. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies; figurative density is high but mostly earned ("paper whispering like leaves that refused to remember wind"). Information density is strong: most lines advance pressure or character. Two frictions: "a map I hate to read on her wrist" and "the only jar that might serve as a heart" stack metaphors without full coherence (wrist scars aren't maps in function, jar-as-heart is asserted not proven). Template cadence in backstory block ("I had come," "It had been," "I told Mara") slightly flattens momentum mid-piece. No loops or scaffold at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.1)
    Line-level clarity is generally high, with vivid images ("dust into small constellations," "breath on paper," "wind over stone") and purposeful syntax. However, paraphrase loops appear: "resounding hush" recurs five times without functional shift, and the phrase "journeying inward while walking out" is repeated verbatim across beats. Template cadence emerges in the three-circle structure with parallel phrasing ("I walked the first circle," "I paced the second circle," "The third circle asked"). These patterns are taught early and serve the accumulative design, so the penalty remains modest, but the loops dull momentum in the final third. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase/template issues in Q7; the artifacts do not touch the closure beat directly but pervade the final moves, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (most lines do two jobs: advance hydraulic work and explore time-measurement theme). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity is strong, though figurative density is elevated in several consecutive beats ("blade of ink," "sieve," "moth colored bellies," "bruise colored clouds") without pattern-teaching, which risks overwriting. The metaphors remain coherent and legible, so the deduction is modest. One minor register drift: "eminently peculiar" feels slightly elevated for in-scene interiority. Propulsion is consistent; the counting-backwards passages compress reflection without stalling momentum. Strong control overall, with minor figurative clustering preventing entry to 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or discovery. Two minor artifacts lower the score: the phrase "widening perspectives responsibly" recurs nearly verbatim three times, creating a conceptual loop, and the final paragraph's philosophical summary ("betting and models, fathers and daughters") risks abstract scaffolding rather than trusting the dramatized image. Figurative language is controlled and apt ("breathing like a scratched metronome," "rain escorting me like a drumline") with no mixed metaphors. Clarity remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the glass harmonica disc I found in a box of spare insulators before I learned the lines" anchors object, timeline, and discovery). Rhythm varies without algorithmic pattern. Two minor frictions: "melodically haunted" recurs three times with near-identical phrasing, creating a small loop; "loop" itself appears frequently (seven instances) but remains functional given the premise. One metaphor wobbles: "room inside their words expands"—spatial metaphor for emotional opening feels slightly generic. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Sentence openings vary. Opening and closing lines charge the hum motif effectively. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the piece breathes rather than rushes.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift across declarative, participial, and temporal frames. Information density is high: "I palm the locket photo that has warmed against me all day, a harbor within a harbor" does triple work (object, emotion, metaphor). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "walnut hulls dark as bruised moons," "a lung learning itself." Two frictions: "surrendering a brown galaxy" mixed with "dark as bruised moons" feels vehicle-crowded in one beat. The phrase "the way gulls hinge silence" is striking but the verb "hinge" strains clarity slightly. No loops or scaffold; propulsion is clean through the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.0)
    Information density is high: most lines layer character, atmosphere, and reciprocity mechanics. Rhythm modulates well (the surveyor exchange slows; the queue sequence accelerates). Minor template cadence appears in "She smiled…She believed…She would show up" (repeated "She [verb]" openings across four lines mid-text) and light synonym churn ("asked for stories," "swapped a promise," "traded batteries") within adjacent beats, triggering a −0.4 deduction for pattern artifacts. The final image ("ribbons to mark wishes fulfilled and wishes pending") propels cleanly. Overwriting check: metaphor density is sustained but mostly coherent; "whisper adjusting its coat" and "fog above the yard" function without mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high; figurative language is purposeful and textured ("trail of musical notes… each bead a small sounding"). Sentence openings vary adequately. However, overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: the clearing paragraph stacks metaphors ("circular as a held breath," "coin laid on the tongue of quiet," "seed of all maps") without room to breathe, and the closure sequence layers abstract nominalizations ("poise," "harbor within," "quiet blaze capable of guiding") that obscure concrete action. Template cadence appears in repeated "He [verb]" stems across the middle third. No paraphrase loops, but the density of figurative vehicles occasionally contradicts (a "nave" that "sang without sound" vs. "the world swiveled around" a tone). These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high, rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is controlled (anomaly as choir, pen as rainstick). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deductions: "I am confidently uncertain, because certainty closes doors" reads expository in a reflective passage; the phrase "through contingent relationships" recurs three times, twice as near-synonym without fresh pressure. The closure image ("invited to sit differently") is clean and propulsive, so non-closure adjustments remain capped at −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without taught pattern ("gulls sleep and tides hum their patient arithmetic," "fingers fletching arrows of meaning," "grief thrums too low for common ears"), creating mild overwriting that slows momentum in the middle third. Two paraphrase loops appear: "the harbor begins to answer" restates the prior "tugs the watching city inward" effect, and the advisor's two consecutive metaphors about tides and shores in successive paragraphs. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density ("volcanic tenderness," "borrowing room," "ember-sparrow," "dawn rummaged through bones") charges multiple beats but occasionally stacks without breathing space, risking purple accumulation. Template cadence appears in mid-section: "A mural...concealed coordinates / A clay bird had a broken wing / Together they formed" runs parallel stems across three lines. The phrase "then withdrew" (wall accepting tapestry) and "then rethreaded" show minor synonym proximity. Information density is high—nearly every line advances discovery—but peak beats (finding Mira, the matches-in-water choice) could tighten by two to three lines to sharpen propulsion. No loops or major clarity breaks; the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and propels forward; opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Figurative language is largely coherent ("sound wave garden," "drumming on everything," "auric lagoon under starlight"). Deductions: mild overwriting in the middle third where metaphor density approaches saturation without pattern-teaching ("as if the plants remembered a lost song and were shy to sing" adds texture but slows momentum slightly). Two brief paraphrase loops appear ("I kept drumming...telling him" → "His pulse found the tempo" recycles the same content). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high: "From my belt I drew a key with no apparent lock, an old brass rod filed to a question. Pressed into certain drain holes, the key turned unseen cams that popped open whisper vents between containers." Figurative language is purposeful and grounded (riverbed guides rain, dog biting its tail, sympathetic rider). Minor deduction: a few near-synonyms cluster without adding pressure—"whisper along the seams," "let a thread of voice slip," "kept whispering her map"—and the final paragraph's "the steel kept my whisper, and I kept their walks" risks lyricism over propulsion. No clarity loss at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "a dented dental mirror that knew how to catch a tremble of light" establishes object, inheritance, and function). Sentence openings vary, rhythm supports the stillwater tone. Minor template-cadence slip: "I do not speak… not ever… a pact that says…" runs three explanatory clauses in sequence without fresh imagery. One paraphrase near the end: "watching the ripple I had not disturbed return to me" echoes the opening's "counting the ripples I chose not to disturb" without added pressure. No loops touch closure; deductions capped at −0.4 per guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is abundant but mostly coherent. Three issues lower the score: (1) the phrase "during the hush where past meets prophecy" appears twice verbatim, constituting a paraphrase loop (−0.4); (2) several lines exhibit slight overwriting ("the amplified quiet lean toward us," "magnetic grotto under starlight" used decoratively in early mentions without immediate pressure); (3) minor filter-verb reliance ("I heard," "I felt") in the climactic sequence, though voice-motivated. The opening and closing lines are strong, and no major causality obscurity occurs. Artifacts touch the closure vicinity but do not obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent: "nerve bright current," "barnacles loose like old poetry," "kelp forests rise like cathedrals." Repeated scaffold phrases ("after violence becomes impossible" opens twice; "sublittoral fringe" recurs six times; "by the call of a whale from the deep" appears four times) create rhythmic anchoring but border on template cadence (−0.5). Some mixed vehicles: "the island's lights wink like distant hearths" follows "island...vanishes by the call of a whale," conflating visual and auditory logic. Paraphrase loop: "I want to find freedom in embracing one's true nature" is restated in "to find freedom...I must walk away from performance" without added pressure (−0.2). Information density is moderate; propulsion sags in the middle reflection beats where multiple lines restate the detachment thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Figurative density is high but coherent: "iron scythes that never finish the harvest of sound," "petals frayed into soft shrapnel," "pale commas," "rehearsing a dance we will never master." Rhythm modulates (long accumulative sentences, then short declaratives: "There is no applause…and he prefers it"). Information density is strong; most lines do multiple jobs. Minor artifact: slight template cadence in the "Observe…Witness…First…Next…Then" sequence risks mechanical patterning, though it's voice-motivated as the performer's dramatized narration. One paraphrase near "dramatically narrating mundane tasks" appears twice in close proximity (lines 9 and 23), creating a small loop. No filter stacks, no mixed metaphors, no pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent, though occasional mixed vehicles appear ("pendulums with an elegant calm," "tremor of certainty moving like a thin animal"). Rhythm varies and paragraph structure modulates with scene pressure. A few paraphrase loops ("he does not mock it; he rinses it" then "rephrasing enforcement into invitation, punishment into passage" repeats the same content) and the final wall inscription feels like scaffolding moralizing. Filter verbs are minimal. Information density is strong but the ending's meta-commentary dulls propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies across beats, and information density is high in the phoenix-transformation sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "bartered awakenings" recurs four times with near-identical phrasing, "communicating through plant arrangements" is restated almost verbatim, and "after the phoenix rises" opens two paragraphs identically. Template cadence in the client-visit beats ("People pass...she asks...he lays out") flattens momentum mid-story. The final image ("he keeps painting the brave cracks") is vivid, but the loops and stock constructions ("innocently cunning" twice, "small awakenings" thrice) accumulate to −0.8 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack. No loops touch the closure beat directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong with high information density and purposeful rhythm: "I am the prism-song bell ringer, hired to call back music that slipped between history's ribs" anchors voice and stakes economically. Read-aloud ear test passes; sentence openings vary and paragraphs create visual rhythm. Minor loop detected: "golden shadows" appears three times (lines 4, 26, 40) without sufficient functional variation between first and second use, and "the bells" + verb structure recurs in adjacent lines mid-piece without pattern-teaching. These loops do not obscure causality or dull the closure image, so penalty remains modest. No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence. Information density is high (most lines advance setting, grief, or ritual logic). Clarity remains solid through spatial and causal sequences. However, figurative density is unrelenting—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated image ("lung paused at top of breath," "grief kept walking," "silvered corridor of focus")—without pattern-teaching or rest, trending toward overwriting in a high-pressure beat. Mixed metaphor: "night learned our pace" anthropomorphizes time inconsistently with "stars held their breath." Minor filter-verb stack in middle third ("I had designed," "I had come"). Paraphrase loop: "I told them... I had come here after hitting rock bottom" repeats the opening without added pressure. Apply −0.6 for density + mixed vehicle + loop.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density pervades nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure: "charts lost their gospel," "braid silt into islands," "kettles, stoops, and cracked posts with tiny arrows no algorithm could counterfeit." This creates texture but slows propulsion and obscures causality. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "multiplying paths" recurs across six distinct sentences without meaningfully advancing pressure; "inherited mystery" toggles between "gift" and "practical" in adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence: "We multiplied pulses into routes, then multiplied routes into patterns…" echoes "We read graffiti as footnotes, mutual aid spreadsheets as epics…" The final beat ("borrowed our breath") is metaphorically opaque rather than concrete. Apply −1.2 for density + loops touching closure; disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with strong images like "thunderheads caught in the throat of a bell" and "opening a vein and watering the street." Information density is high; lines often do multiple jobs. However, the piece shows pattern debt: "anguished joy" appears three times, "across the end of innocence" twice as a refrain without clear reweighting, and several lines carry near-paraphrase (e.g., the steadiness/rhythm paradox is restated). Minor template cadence in the purification sequence. These artifacts do not obscure closure but dull momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift between declarative anchors ("I shelve them") and lyric constructions ("Some say shadows only mimic"). Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character method, or the shadow's arc. Minor template cadence appears in the "gathers…gathers…gathers" triplet and "where day loosens…where the shadow bows" parallelism, but these read as intentional lyric pattern rather than scaffold. One paraphrase loop: "what it wants is not escape; what it wants is to preserve the shape of hope" restates without added pressure. Figurative language is dense in peak beats (stone circuit, pollen of letters, moths/lanterns) but remains coherent. No filter-verb stacks or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful but frequent—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile, occasionally slowing momentum in the middle third ("coil loosening in a patient spiral," "stories collapsed," "torn net," "small comets"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Syntax varies. The closure image is clean. One minor filter-verb stack in early reflection ("had a way of listening," "had shaken") does not obscure pressure. Overwriting is controlled but approaches the density threshold in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance image, choice, or pressure. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent ("frosted hourglass exhales a pale breath," "sap rises like a sigh"). Minor overwriting in clusters: "meteor hush" recurs three times, and some metaphors stack without full payoff ("coffee rings...dried into concentric moons" then "tree rings" feels slightly redundant). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. One mixed vehicle: "tunnel down the throat of brick" (throat implies flesh, brick implies masonry) momentarily blurs. Final line offers crisp closure. Artifact load is light; propulsion remains strong through peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "projector purrs like hushed thunder," "alphabet of silver," "stairwells of kisses, emergency exits of regret." Clarity holds through layered images. Minor overwriting concern: near-adjacent metaphors occasionally crowd ("river," "boats," "ink trying to find its river") without adding pressure, and some lines paraphrase earlier content ("unused love resists ink" restates the prior image of smeared words). Template cadence appears in a few mid-section lines ("I feel... I search... I listen...") but does not dominate. No loops or scaffold touch the closure beat. Information density is high; momentum builds toward the final threading.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is generally controlled, with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths that create visual cadence. Information density is high in places—"windows unlatched as we passed, and shy lamps leaned out like listeners, and the boarded shops breathed"—but the piece also carries decorative metaphor runs in high-pressure beats that slow propulsion: "Their unspoken plea rustled against my ribs" followed immediately by "The creativity of a hundred minds had been trapped by fear of the day, and now it slept standing up." Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "I [verb]" structures across adjacent lines. Minor paraphrase loops: "the aurora flared, and the instrument awoke" followed shortly by "the aurora heard me through stone, answering in ripples." The closure beat is clean, but mid-section figurative density and some filter-verb stacks ("I felt the hour," "I should have exulted") dull immediacy. No single artifact touches closure, so the accumulation cap applies: −0.8 for template stems and figurative stacking in pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is dense and specific ("pollen colored like drowned stars," "letters sprouting stems and leaves"). However, template cadence pervades: "He [verb]" openers run across most beats ("He hums," "He intends," "He lowers," "He sets," "He knees," "He speaks," "He is," "He sees," "He charms," "He cups," "He could," "He lifts"), creating a drumbeat that flattens propulsion in high-pressure moments. Synonym churn appears in adjacent lines: "hisses to a halt" / "steps down," "whispers" / "shivers," "employs" / "arranges." Mixed metaphors strain clarity: "interference chisels a door from certainty" conflates wave and stonework, and "drowned stars" as pollen color contradicts luminosity. These artifacts touch multiple beats but do not obscure the closure image, so the deduction is capped at −1.4 per the Text-Artifact Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies well and figurative language is purposeful for the lyric mode. Clarity holds in most beats, though some constructions are strained: "a memory with my wrists in its mouth, and it turns the gear inside my head" mixes vehicle (mouth, gear) without coherent mechanics. Information density is high, with most lines advancing image and concept, but paraphrase loops appear: "The hum of insight is not a single note, but a migration of tones" closely echoes "currents of sound braid beneath the canopy, each current a corridor." Template cadence runs in the catalog of metal trees ("Metal palms whisper… copper laurels clatter… bronze pines breathe" then repeated with aluminum, steel, nickel) without variation in syntactic frame. Stock metaphors ("seed of rustless sunrise," "trickster tide") appear alongside fresh ones. The closure beat is metaphorically dense but legible; apply −0.6 for paraphrase and template patterns, preventing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character choice, or symbolic charge. However, figurative language appears in most sentences without respite ("sea sigh," "conch-hum whispers," "bruise warming," "shed snake skin," "moonbread air"), creating cumulative density that slows momentum in the middle third. Two minor loops: "gently persistent" recurs as both descriptor and guide attribution without added nuance, and "traverse" / "indirect routes" pair repeatedly in similar syntactic slots. No grammar or clarity breaks; the overwriting stays legible but pushes against the policy ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.3)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("bruise pressed against the horizon," "nerve regeneration that burned like starlight," "engine of shutters and baffles"), though some vehicles strain legibility ("a parliament of sensation debating," "frostbitten hope thawing just enough to prove it lived"). Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Minor loops: "seraphically mundane" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure; "via the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase" recurs verbatim as a teaching moment but reads slightly mechanical. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. The bolt-threading sequence is concrete and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high and often mixed: "dust moved like thoughtful constellations testing their own patience" pairs abstraction ("thoughtful") with concreteness awkwardly; "letters in the margins unstuck from paper and hovered like moths waiting for wrists to open" stacks vehicles without clear tenor. Template cadence appears in mid-section beats: "She wrote…Each pellet…Lys seasoned…" runs parallel stems across contiguous paragraphs. Paraphrase loops surface ("He had been revising blood with footnotes, smoothing centuries into obedient paragraphs" / "He had a smile like linen, well laundered, promising a reign without wrinkles") where adjacent lines restate control imagery. These artifacts dull momentum in the middle third. Clarity is mostly intact, but overwriting slows propulsion and some metaphors ("letters…waiting for wrists to open") obscure rather than sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. High information density: "She did not vanish, but her stories did, each tide taking details until the route blurred" does character, theme, and setting work in one line. Clarity is strong, though some lines border lush ("a mirage paved with glinting eels and rumor"). Minor loop: "periodically eternal" appears twice in similar phrasing. No template cadence, no paraphrase runs. Figurative language is thick but coherent and voice-motivated. The final image recharges the torn page: "kept where it can lead." Propulsion is steady; the boredom-to-revelation sequence accelerates appropriately. One small deduction for density verging on overwriting in the middle third without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance image, action, or atmosphere. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent reflective beats: "the lull in rebellion was the only bandage… But a lull is not surrender… letting the quiet that shelters us" recycles the lull concept without adding pressure. One paraphrase loop near the climax: "the coil took the hum and fed it into the engine's sleeping heart" closely echoes prior phrasing. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "algae on dark water" and "dignified refusal to stay dead" work well. No major loop or clarity break touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines serve multiple jobs (e.g., "ash in her braid and court fines in her pocket" establishes insurgent status and legal conflict). Rhythm varies and figurative language ("middle music," "roots explore stone") is purposeful. Minor loop: "implanted destiny" recurs frequently—acceptable as motif but borders on insistence. Template cadence check: several sentences open with "The" or "She" in the ritual sequence, creating slight monotony but not enough to obscure causality. No major clarity lapses; the Text Artifact Screen passes. Propulsion is strong through the unsealing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., "she missed the idea of someone watching weather, the way a village misses a violin even if it never danced" advances voice, setting memory, and thematic longing simultaneously). Rhythm varies across beats; no template cadence runs. Minor slip: "quietly talented" recurs three times in similar syntactic slots without pattern payoff, approaching template repetition (−0.3). "Harbor drone skittered" and "spray swaggering" are fresh. No loops, clear propulsion, zero muddy metaphors at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high, and figurative language (fog feathered, ocean schooling inside the tower, fogbones) is purposeful and pattern-taught. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "fragmented reality" appears multiple times without added pressure, "luminescent ache" recurs as a label rather than evolving through action, and "walls close in" is stated twice in similar phrasing. The untangling sequence demonstrates clear propulsion, but earlier paragraphs carry synonym churn ("steady gaze, without a subject that would stay") and abstract stacks that slow momentum before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high and rhythm varies purposefully, but several beats loop conceptually: "serene anger" recurs three times with near-identical phrasing, and the explanation of time-dilation ("braided noticing," "holding breath together") is paraphrased across two adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Figurative language is vivid ("the wind is an orchestra of halted crescendos") but occasionally stacks without pattern payoff in the middle third. The opening and closing lines anchor strongly, and no pronoun drift or sequence errors mar clarity, keeping the piece above mid-band despite scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density and varied syntax maintain momentum. Figurative language is pervasive but mostly coherent: "sentences kissed like steel meeting flint," "dust moved like startled fish," "letter walked among them like a patient librarian." The piece teaches its cadence (breathing, ticking, blinking) and pays it off. Minor artifacts: "dizzying quiet" recurs three times without evolving meaning; "the blink that follows surprise" appears twice in identical phrasing; "patience" modifies multiple nouns (lungs, fireflies, librarian) in a way that risks template. A handful of lines approach overwriting ("coil of contraband truths that moved like a serpent") but the closure beat is clean. No loops or scaffolding that obscure causality. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally with strong propulsion; sentences do multiple jobs (the sandbag passage establishes object, father's absence, and current use in three beats). Opening anchors voice and stakes; closing line recharges prior material. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("engraved quiet," "blazing gently," "sheathing thunder"). However, metaphoric density approaches overwriting in the final third—multiple figurative constructions per sentence without clear pattern-teaching ("continuity is a loom," "a man sheathing thunder," "water the dust into possibility") create slight opacity. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and information density is high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative density is high but legible. Three distinct line-level issues lower the score: (1) The phrase "transliterates emotions" (and variants: "transliterate emotions," "transliterated ache") recurs five times, creating a label loop that dulls closure-adjacent beats. (2) Template cadence: "He [verb]" structures dominate ("He wore," "He does it," "He swung," "He let," "He leaned," "He cupped," "He would pour"), flattening propulsion in the final third. (3) Mixed metaphor: "pockets where echoes pooled" followed by "drew tight around the note as if around a bright animal"—liquid and capture-net vehicles clash. Information density is high and no scaffolding appears, but the loops and cadence stiffness prevent higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high (most lines advance character, proof, or image), and no paraphrase loops appear. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "history pricks your palm," "graphs look back like children," "cursor blinks like a fuse." However, the frequency of metaphor in nearly every sentence ("wind hisses through lashes," "echoes thank you in a tongue we can finally print," "dawn flips clouds into coins") risks overwriting, particularly in the final two paragraphs where three consecutive images (clouds/coins, coffee/contrition, stars/counsel) compress without clear escalation. The calibration-lamp and histogram proofs are lucid, but the surrounding ornament occasionally competes with clarity. Apply −0.6 for density and minor register drift in peak beats, preventing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but coherent within the lyric mode. Information load per line is strong: "Its drawers still smell like ash and lavender, and something waits in them" does triple duty (anchor, mood, forward pressure). A few minor loops appear: "haunted firmware" is named twice in quick succession, and "the fold" recurs without fresh pressure mid-story. The final paragraph risks slight overwriting ("the signature at last," "I understand the motive the way a tide understands the moon") but the closure image (amber cooling, insect blinking/dust moving) compensates with concrete specificity. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and diction is specific to the artist's idiom. Information density is high (each beat layering mandala work, object use, interpersonal moments). However, metaphoric saturation—"echoes into a braided patience," "tide reversing, revealing pooled seashell thoughts," "eyelid mid blink," "emptied pocket sigh"—clusters in nearly every line of high-pressure beats without clear payoff differentiation, triggering density penalty (−0.4). Some constructions blur sense: "which swallowed it gratefully" anthropomorphizes moss without prior cue, and "noise learned to lean" abstracts the resolution. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; syntax varies. Clarity holds but the figurative load in the closure third disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (tessera as door/padlock, mercy as contraband, arms as steel scripture). No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats. Figurative language is dense—"sky is a peeled fruit," "time becomes a braid"—and occasionally stacks without full pattern-teaching, risking slight overwriting in the middle third. The closing lines ("I name the blue shard a bell, I name the cracks a map") achieve propulsive resonance. Clarity holds; one scaffold phrase ("people think mercy must fit the ledger") edges toward tell but serves voice.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent (echoes-as-seeds, time-as-thread, light splashing in notes), but several lines layer metaphors without advancing clarity: "time here is a fractured timeline pruned into spirals" and "Dates grow like fruit, futures like blossoms, and the props of discarded scenes dangle as scarecrows to frighten off despair" read ornamental rather than pressure-driving. Paraphrase loop: "The orchard agrees by producing echoes...and the leaves taste like green brass hope" immediately after "the notes I coax sound as violet as summer dusk" restates sensory confirmation without new information. Rhythm varies purposefully in peak beats (coin flip, blueprint discovery), and information density is high in the closure sequence. Minor template cadence in the dawn paragraph ("and Rowan brings...and the hedge-shadows...and the blueprint unfolds") but does not obscure cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: "limp-clicking between my fingers like willowglass hope made mineral" does three jobs (texture, metaphor, character voice). Sentence rhythm varies—urgent fragments during the dance, longer accumulative syntax in reflection. Minor loop: "practical as ever" echoes "affectionate always" without added pressure. Figurative language is concentrated but coherent: "fractally precise," "braided strands," "laddered to the rafters." One template-cadence run in the wand-trigger sequence ("flared green… stuttered… sliced") but it serves the beat's staccato rhythm. No clarity loss at closure; the grounding coil and final promise land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally with minimal template cadence. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "the fossil anchors a relic smell that the stone remembers" echoes "Buried woods once shaded this bay, and the tide still carries tannin and pollen ghosts," and "the unknown does not speak in words, but in pressures and temperatures" near-repeats the earlier sensory-mapping premise. Stock metaphor "like a gently opened door" in a peak beat triggers −0.3. "As if still wicking rain" and "like dawn behind my eyes" remain voice-apt. These issues accumulate to −0.4 total in Q7; closure beat ("I sit on the cold step and log the procedure") remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong with vivid imagery ("sand is a choir," "echo thrums") and varied syntax that accelerates during the spiral and bell sequence. Information density is high in the opening third, efficiently layering setting, backstory, and motive. However, the piece exhibits several line-level artifacts: paraphrase loops ("the canyon echo in a jar" repeated across multiple paragraphs with minimal reweighting until the unsealing), template cadence in the middle third ("I do not…I simply…" / "We take…we turn…we walk"), and synonym churn around "prophecy" / "sentence" / "thread" that recycles rather than sharpens meaning. The collective action sequence ("We walk it…We return…We sweep, we stack, we quiet") stacks parallel constructions without propulsive variation, flattening momentum at a pivotal beat. Stock metaphors appear: "flock returning," "spine," "thread," which function but lack fresh charge. The opening and closing lines are purposeful, yet the final aphorism ("organizes it so it can begin") shifts into abstract summary after concrete imagery. Clarity remains high throughout; no major grammatical or continuity errors, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. The overwriting is concentrated in mid-passage figurative density ("memory flares," "cord like a spine," "rain stored in rock") without consistent physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative language is dense throughout ("zephyr bluff," "silver hush," "wind a careful hand," "alphabet blossomed," "smiled like a bruise remembering its color") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure; this triggers the overwriting density penalty (−0.5). Several lines carry metaphoric vehicles that nearly contradict ("breeze writes," "courage waits," "nation of promises") but remain legible. Information density is high; most sentences advance. Minor paraphrase loop: "codes in accumulated snow" appears three times without meaningful variation (−0.2). Syntax varies; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Grammar is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. "Fog breathed across the ford like old silk unspooling" and "rain stitched the eaves" work. However, mid-story density approaches overwriting: "ambient awareness," "percolate," "spindrift serenity," and "closely attentive" recur as motifs but occasionally slow momentum in the waiting sequence. No loops or template cadence. Final image is clean. Deduction for moderate figurative density in non-peak beats (−0.3 to −0.5 range) that does not obscure but slows.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or charge motifs (braids, thrum, phototropic kindness). Rhythm varies purposefully, though some sentences share a template cadence ("In one braid...in another...in a third"; "I tested it by...I tested it by") that borders on pattern-taught parallelism but verges on formulaic when not explicitly framed. Figurative language is dense ("light like threads tugging at my wrists," "freshwater hair") without becoming muddy, and spatial blocking remains clear. Minor scaffold phrases ("I had come to understand," "I realized") summarize insight rather than dramatizing the micro-choice that triggers it, nudging momentum slightly downward in those beats.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("light like milk," "hush like fog"). Information density is high—lines anchor image, motive, and memory simultaneously. Two slips lower the score: "quivering hush" recurs across multiple beats without escalating meaning (paraphrase loop), and occasional elevated diction ("instill steadiness in waters") drifts slightly from the established idiom. No grammar errors. The final image—thorns catching seams—propels without muddle. Apply −0.4 for the loop and register drift, capping below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.7)
    Figurative density is high and largely coherent ("atomically reflective," "tide," "hum"), but several beats loop conceptually: "isolation into independence" appears three times with paraphrase variations, and "coexist" recurs without added pressure mid-text. Template cadence in the closing paragraph ("I set…and the library decided…There, between…") stacks parallel constructions. Sentence rhythm varies, but information density dips in reflective passages that restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and aural flow. Information density is high: most lines advance character, image, or atmosphere. Minor loop: "the ribbon" recurs frequently without always adding new pressure, and "secrets" echoes in similar phrasing across three beats. The final image is clean and propulsive. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one phrase ("pupil opening, asking me to look again") borders on mixed metaphor but remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("tricksters wearing vacuum for boots," "voices arrive as thin frost across the noise floor," "power plays multiply like mold in the vents"), charging the liminal atmosphere. Information load is strong: most lines advance character knowledge (charts predict nodes), world detail (subsonic frequencies felt in ribs/teeth), or pressure (provost's eyes "two shutters"). Sentence variety supports rhythm, and technical terminology (patch bay, synthesis rack, ionosphere, node) reads plausible and character-specific. However, paraphrase loops and template cadence recur: "Some claim angels, some claim criminals, some claim pranksters" (list); "Students turn against professors, professors against administrators, administrators against the station, donors against everyone" (mechanical parallelism without micro-variation); "The tricksters adore this, because power plays are their habitat" followed immediately by "the bruised fruit where they lay eggs" (metaphor stacked without integration). These patterns appear in mid-story beats and soften propulsion. The closure beat is clean. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: baseline −0.6 for template runs and paraphrase loops across multiple beats, raised to −0.8 because one instance ("rumors say…another rumor says") touches a high-pressure moment (administration threat).

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines advancing atmosphere, choice, or image. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and motivated by the protagonist's spatial/musical lens. Two line-level issues: mild template cadence in mid-section beats ("I pressed another key, then another"; "I told it quietly that I would not bind it, only ask for room") and one paraphrase loop ("It was not holy work, nor wholly mine, but it was mine enough" recaps prior stance without added pressure). These artifacts do not touch the closure image but reduce propulsion slightly in the penultimate paragraph. No ambiguous pronouns or tense slips; grammar is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings show range. Information density is high in the investigation beats (ribbon texture, knot identification, breath arrangement). However, paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "He tied…and let it test," "He drew…and pressed…naming," "He could not know…but he heard" stack similar syntactic stems without variation. The phrase "by unifying opposites" recurs verbatim three times as a conceptual placeholder rather than embodied action, creating synonym-churn effect. "Furrowed hush" bookends the piece (opening and "the quarry held a furrowed hush") but the repeated exact phrase feels mechanical rather than transformed. Minor scaffold: "It was careful, trained, the cadence of…" introduces the captain with a construction that tells competence rather than showing breath pattern. Artifacts touch but do not obscure the closure image, so penalty remains within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high; most lines layer character, atmosphere, and plot. Figurative language ("gulls scissor the saturated air as if cutting a dress from skin," "tiny world almost clicks") is vivid but clusters heavily, risking overwriting in peak beats. Template-cadence runs appear: "I arrive... I call... I am... I carry... I question... I map" across multiple paragraphs, creating a drumbeat that flattens propulsion. Paraphrase loop: "reversible exile" is named, then Mirek repeats "what we are under the gentle phrase reversible exile" two paragraphs later without added pressure. Minor syntax monotony in parallel "I [verb]" stems.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative density is high and occasionally mixed: "wind untangling the scaffold wrap" after wrap has been fluttering suggests contradictory mechanics. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "He says... He calls... He asks... He grins" across consecutive beats. Paraphrase loops: "the hitchhiker turning once more to choose" / "he waited because he knew the bridge-song fiddler would hear" restate the same retreat without added pressure. Information density is uneven; some lines do multiple jobs ("fireweed writes pink claims over black soil"), while others ornament without advancing stakes. Apply −0.8 for density and loop patterns per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (each line advances character or theme). Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled and voice-consistent. Small deduction: "saints of paper, foreign eyes that never blinked" and "a traveling reliquary" tilt toward stock metaphor in adjacent lines, though they serve the motif. The final sequence ("left three bills to flutter for the kid, shut the lion door gently, and followed the river until the dark carried me like a train") is propulsive and imagistic. No scaffolding or synonym churn detected.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, setting, or stakes. Runs of similar syntactic patterns appear: "She said / I said / We tested / We phoned" creates template cadence in the second half without taught pattern payoff, triggering −0.4. Figurative density clusters in several beats ("the dome breathed like a sleeping whale," "ledger of the sky," "wet stone turning into wheat") without mid-scene grounding action to anchor them, risking overwriting in peak moments. Two paraphrase loops: lines 7–8 restate that words "carry others" and "carry shared burdens" without added pressure; lines 15–16 echo Orla's instructions in narrator summary then quote. Propulsion remains strong through the translation sequence, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance ritual, revelation, or interiority. Figurative language is purposeful ("hush like armor," "apples orbiting…in a solemn storm") and pattern-consistent. Two small frictions lower the score: "Because she finds lost things and returns them" reads scaffoldy in paragraph two, and the opening's "After the magic trick fails, the lake stops pretending" double-states the framing. Sentence openings vary; no template runs. Clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm is lyric and propulsive with varied sentence openings and strong imagery. However, the piece suffers from density saturation: nearly every sentence carries figurative weight ("root-bound," "heart pinned to murmuring loam," "eclipse yields," "bell has finally become home"), creating ornamental accumulation rather than selective purpose. Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated parallel constructions ("I feel," "I am," "We are"). Paraphrase loops occur ("The girl squeezes my hand, and roots loosen enough to allow breath" restates release already implied by the shared opening). These artifacts cluster in the closure approach, lowering the band and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "fever broke," "graft took like morning," "breath stitched with soot." Clarity occasionally suffers from stacked metaphors: "market of bartered destinies" and "holes it makes in people" and "trammel that breath" within three beats risks mixed vehicle logic. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "I traced... I told... I answered... I began..." runs across four moves. Information density is high—most lines advance both action and atmosphere—but "fiercely gentle" is asserted three times without fresh embodiment. Propulsion remains strong; no paraphrase loops touch the closure beat. One minor homophone slip: "dusky resolve" functions as tone label rather than sensory anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and pressure simultaneously ("The scrap prickled my thumb, as if asking whether I had finally fallen to souvenir work"). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the filing cabinet sequence, breathing in the Abel memory. Minor template cadence in the opening repetition ("After failing publicly" appears twice within ~150 words) and slight filter-verb stack in the Lark observation paragraph ("watched my face align and misalign"). No paraphrase loops; figurative language (valley as amphitheater, kids as notes on a stave) remains coherent and voice-motivated. The final image propels without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., "It is smooth as an almond and heavy as a magnet, strangely warm with careful memory" conveys weight, texture, and thematic charge). Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer syntactic units during ritual preparation and shorter beats at key intensifications ("I answer that I will"). Figurative language—"the arbor names it with a thousand patient tones," "departures teach arrivals how to wait"—is concentrated but mostly purposeful. However, several lines verge on overwriting: "a gate that opens and remembers both sides," "thresholds as amphorae that pour their shape forward," "bodies as scripts that continue when the scribe lifts the stylus" cluster metaphors that, while coherent, slightly dilute urgency in the middle third. Minor paraphrase loop: "gradients can be read" / "I translate the pulse as I would a tablet" restates the analogical method without advancing it. No template cadence, no severe loops. Sentence openings vary well. A tighter trim of one or two metaphor strings would elevate clarity without sacrificing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or poetic image—but most vehicles are internally coherent and advance atmosphere or character logic (creel "respects," shelves "purr," atrium "breathes"). Template-cadence risk: multiple sentences open with "I [verb]" or "[Noun] [verb] like [vehicle]," creating mild rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops appear: "migrating identities" recurs across paragraphs without added pressure; "wonder" and "contradictions" are restated in adjacent lines. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (smelting = cataloguing = ritual), others linger in description. No hard prose artifacts obscure causality, but the accumulation of decorative constructions and stock stems ("the way [noun] [verb]") nudges mid-band rather than high.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and figurative language ("knuckles inside a glass hand," "breath learned by heart") is fresh and legible. However, several lines loop or restate: "latent radiance" appears three times in similar phrasing, "abandoned hopes" recurs without added detail, and "the pearl did not flare; it remembered" is followed immediately by "its remembering poured out," creating a paraphrase echo. The final third maintains propulsion, but the mid-section carries minor scaffold ("I found the offerings… rusted charms, a child's boot, and a seashell") that slows momentum. No clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; figurative language is dense but coherent ("bellows patched with tape breathing like a stitched animal determined to live"). Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and stakes simultaneously. The loop check is mostly clean, though "accordion bellows patched with tape" recurs four times with slight phrasing variation—acceptable as motif but bordering on redundancy. One minor template-cadence slip: "I told... I whispered... I traced... I wrote" clusters participles in the climax sequence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, template cadence appears in multiple beats: "I [verb], and…" stems recur across paragraphs ("I obeyed, and the path revealed," "I stepped closer… and the glowing library took shape," "I smiled, then veiled my smile, and began"). Paraphrase loop in the closure sequence: the paragraph beginning "Between those letters" restates the thematic summary without adding pressure. Minor figurative muddle: "handwriting erased and rewritten" metaphor for fog movement reads strained. These artifacts lower propulsion in non-closure beats. Clarity and concision otherwise strong; no grammar or pronoun issues.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("transparent violin made of ice crystal, cold as confession," "rain formed brown galaxies on my desk"). Two friction points lower the score from 8+: (1) minor paraphrase loop in the coffee-stain sequence ("The stains are maps… inviting a thumb to tear… a dotted arch… All maps point to a single uncut line that my thumb now cannot resist")—the "map/line/thumb" cluster repeats conceptually across four lines without added pressure; (2) occasional elevated diction that edges toward over-writing ("stations of return," "netted city"). Clarity remains high and no artifacts touch the closure beat, so the penalty is modest. Information density is strong; most lines do multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high: "It warmed, and a faint speckled light crawled through it like spores rising, then stilled." Sentence openings vary and figurative language is mostly coherent. However, several lines loop conceptually without advancing pressure: "the hush thickened" and "the silence gathered not like absence but like invitation" restate atmosphere; "lucidly watchful" appears three times with minimal tactical differentiation. The phrase "infuse" recurs mechanically (lips, cheeks, parting). Template cadence in reflective beats ("She always said," "She had left me," "She had taught me") slightly flattens momentum. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and synonym churn touching multiple beats, preventing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully in the final beats, and the opening frames voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high, with many lines layering action, image, and reflection. However, multiple adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure: "I forgave her because grief had unseamed her" followed two beats later by "I forgave her because forgiveness was the only knife"; "contentment is not a springhead but a hundred careful grooves" then "contentment is not found but grown" near the end. Template cadence runs appear mid-piece ("I [verb]... I [verb]... I [verb]...") across four consecutive sentences. Mixed metaphor in "grief had unseamed her" (textile metaphor) followed immediately by "knife I dared to carry forward" (blade metaphor) without transition. These artifacts cluster in reflective passages and dull momentum, though the closure beat remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high and rhythm modulates well ("copper trembles for risk, uncertain but warm"). No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor issues: "a way to present a plan that keeps doorways open while waves are held back" slightly abstracts the conditional-signature tactic; "sincerely insincere" recurs without syntactic variation; and "the only way the work works" in the opening uses repetition that reads intentional but borders on precious. The closure beat is clean. Figurative density in the first third (oysters, coded clicks, ember language) occasionally slows momentum without clear escalation payoff until the chime work begins.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, overwriting appears in stacked metaphors and elevated diction throughout: "truth carefully," "restrained glowed from his silence," "dissolving minutes," "magnetic to thought." Template cadence is present in parallel constructions: "He said... he said... he told me... he murmured." Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "seemed") stack in the middle third. These artifacts dull immediacy and apply a −0.8 penalty in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact-penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose carries high information density and purposeful rhythm, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("I speak to it softly, historically reverent, promising no theft, only guidance"). However, figurative density approaches overwriting in several beats—nearly every sentence layers metaphor without respite, creating cumulative drag. Paraphrase loops appear: "The canyon has served as ledger and liturgy" followed immediately by similar accounting metaphors. Template cadence emerges in repeated "I [verb]" openings across the final third. These artifacts dull momentum without breaking causality, meriting penalty here per the routing rule.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm modulates with scene needs. Minor loop detected: "brilliant dimness" recurs across multiple beats without escalating pressure each time (−0.3). Figurative language is dense in the spire sequence—"moonmilk saturated into stone," "thin bridges unrolling like breath"—but remains coherent and pattern-taught. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. One scaffold phrase: "I understood then" slightly externalizes realization rather than dramatizing it (−0.2). Strong propulsion overall, no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies with purpose, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Minor loop: "quiet hunger was to discover" and "I knew I hid there" repeat the hiding theme within close proximity without advancing it. Template cadence appears in the underwater sequence: "I took... I pressed... I realized... I found... I pressed again... I rose"—six consecutive sentences opening with "I [past verb]" flatten propulsion during the climax. Mixed metaphor: "sky folding its lanterned pages" introduces book imagery not established elsewhere. Information density is high, but the figurative load in nearly every sentence of the descent/discovery beat risks overwriting without pattern-payoff, though the accumulative effect ultimately coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance ritual, prophecy decoding, or choice. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: amber as trapped time, coins as tuning geometry, static as backwards speech. Minor overwriting in peak beats: "stellar doubt threads everything like the echo of burned chimes" stacks metaphor without clear payoff, and "our voices carried in amber breath" mixes registers. Template cadence appears in repeated "I [verb]" openings across multiple paragraphs, reducing rhythmic variation. No paraphrase loops or major scaffold, but the syntactic uniformity and occasional mixed metaphors ("lowering its lonely hum" anthropomorphizes then drops the effect) pull the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density; most lines layer image, action, and character (prism work, naming, atlas annotations). Rhythm varies purposefully. Minor loop: "echoes forgotten phrases" appears twice in similar phrasing without reweighting. Some figurative density in mid-beats ("grief leans in," "paper jaw and patient eyes") but coherent and earned. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. The final paragraph propels cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines do double duty (e.g., "rope thin as regret and twice as strong" conveys both object and emotion). Rhythm varies; no template cadence. Minor overwriting in the opening third: "ordinary miracle, a plausible impossibility you can catch on the tongue" stacks metaphor without clear advancement. A few near-paraphrases: "earnestly naive" appears twice in close proximity without new pressure. No loops or artifacts in the closure beat. Propulsion is clean through the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in early beats ("porches reappear as ribs of wood"). However, the opening and closing paragraphs loop phrasing: "vigilant levee warden," "midnight ridgeway at twilight," "mirrored hush," and "precisely humane" appear multiple times without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("I [verb]," "We [verb]") flattens propulsion. Figurative language occasionally stacks without payoff ("moth wing of glassless memory" is vivid but "ripples something in my chest" is vague). No major artifacts touch closure, keeping the score in the sevens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most lines advance ritual, perception, or thematic resonance. Rhythm varies between short declaratives ("She laughed a little") and longer imagistic sentences. However, paraphrase loops appear: "sentiment was a solvent" recaps the vial-collecting already shown; "truth was not an answer to tuck away; it was a rhythm to inhabit" and the following line both restate the same insight. Template cadence in the middle third: multiple "She [verb]" openers stack without taught pattern (−0.4). No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot without padding. Rhythm varies naturally—short bursts during the buckle crisis ("Do not look"), longer breath in the final paragraph. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor issues: "the soundless echo" recurs four times, functioning as motif but verging on over-reliance; "After the radio static clears" bookends the piece purposefully but the third instance ("for the final time") feels slightly mechanical. Figurative density is controlled and voice-motivated ("my stomach becomes the canopy"), though "lightning tastes the underside" in the crisis beat is vivid but edges toward ornamental given the buckle's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("bamboo blade that slices through pretense," "numbness was the quiet court," "parcels of wind"), and several images in peak beats border on mixed metaphor ("seed is not a thing but a direction" works; "clones watched for a signal from me, and even my numbness leaned forward" personifies numbness in a way that slightly muddies agency). Template cadence appears in the middle section with repetitive "It said" and "The sensei said" openers. Information density is strong, but the metaphoric load in high-pressure beats risks obscuring cause-effect linkage for some readers.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching or payoff structure: "syllables macerate in the wet turbulence," "skein, brittle as frost," "dawn" personified as arrival. In peak beats (tunnel laughter emerging), metaphor stacks without clarifying causal pressure, reducing propulsion. Minor paraphrase loop: "the tunnel answered... then thickening" restates the same intensification across two beats without added detail. Template cadence: "I [verb]" stems recur across six consecutive lines mid-ritual. Rhythm and clarity are otherwise strong; information density is high when metaphor recedes. No scaffold or loops outside the noted runs.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and many lines do multiple jobs ("He clicked his tongue against a gold tooth and lifted a cultist's pendant from a tangle of vines frozen into glass" conveys action, object, and world texture in one). However, paraphrase loops appear: "we practiced the plain bravery of letting minutes pass" is immediately echoed by "When the waiting steadied us," and "interiorizing exteriors" is described twice in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Figurative density is high throughout ("letters cut from hoarfrost and breathed into motion," "generous ribs") and some metaphors strain coherence (shelves as "generous ribs" imports anatomy without clear vehicle logic). Template cadence: runs of "We [verb]" structures in the final third ("We walked," "We turned," "We entered") flatten momentum. These artifacts lower Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but overwriting and patterned artifacts accumulate. Figurative language appears in most sentences across multiple beats without always serving propulsion: "embers braided a quiet spiral," "sleepwalking sparrows," "a collapsed star of gray," "hooked fish," "banked coals and morning ice" pile up, and some vehicles contradict (embers don't braid; sparrows don't sleepwalk in the mechanical sense). Template cadence runs appear: "He did not flinch... He remembered... He had stolen... He cooled... He sanded... He bled... He would... He pressed." Several adjacent sentences restate without added pressure: "stoically sensitive" recurs as a label across three beats; "the penny drops" appears twice in close succession. These artifacts dull immediacy in mid-story beats and trigger cumulative deductions (−0.8 for density + coherence + template stems). The final paragraph's lyricism is purposeful and charges closure, which limits total damage.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high; most lines advance situation, character memory, or atmospheric constraint. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the tuning sequence. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Minor deduction: "serenely electric" recurs three times without evolving function, and a few lines edge toward stock lyricism ("small seeds wrapped in endings"). The closure beat is clean and propulsive. Figurative language (star/hush argument, gorge as preserver) remains coherent and voice-motivated throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent: "starlight threads down…as if the sky trawled for souls," "hourglass turns without hands," "my feet thin into wake." Two metaphors verge on mixed logic: "glass clear as gull bones" (bones are opaque) and "knot and unknot" applied to reflections strains the vehicle. Template cadence appears in mid-section: "He points to…to…to…and to" and "I tip…The glass remains…We pull…In the hourglass" create a formulaic rhythm across three paragraphs. Information density is strong; most lines advance situation or atmosphere. No loops or synonym churn, but the pattern artifacts in the grotto scene lower propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"rooms that argued gently," "harmonics traced the shape of a brother," "frost composing itself"—and while most images are coherent, they cluster heavily in every beat without pattern-teaching or payoff differentiation. "Realistically imaginary, articulate and obedient to their own strangeness" stacks modifiers without clarity gain. The parenthetical gloss on "erupt" is scaffolding. Several sentence stems repeat: "She [verb]…," "The [noun] [verb]…" across adjacent lines. Information density is high, but the opacity in peak beats (the phantom witness exchange) slightly obscures causality. No paraphrase loops, but the figurative saturation in the final third dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propels: "We built our domes hard and clear after discovering aliens" contrasts with the longer, accretive "As the beam threads the ring, we expand the field slowly…" Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: the sea as "cathedral," stars that "speak," plankton "like pixels." Minor muddle: "where light loses patience" mixes agency oddly with the inanimate. A handful of scaffold phrases recur: "the chain link" appears in proximity without always doing new work, and "somber," "pressure," "edges" cycle. Paraphrase loop: "teaching our hands to read the ring's edge and the city's hum" echoes prior descriptions without added pressure. No loops touch the closure beat. Information density is high; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify. Information density is high—most lines advance character, stakes, or sensory pressure. Two mild artifacts: "I tell him" / "I say" / "I assure him" stacks filter verbs in adjacent beats (mid-encounter with Eli) and "contact tracer for hearts" recurs as exact phrase twice without functional difference, a minor loop. No paraphrase cycles or template cadence runs. Figurative language ("cathedral of breath," "fear becomes gratitude") coheres and charges closure without overwriting. Propulsion remains strong; no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "the surf kept time above him" anchors setting, urgency, and tone). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Clarity is strong in peak beats. One distinct issue: figurative language appears frequently without always advancing pressure—"crashing hush" recurs four times, "phase transitions" structures multiple beats, and several metaphors (cables as veins, walkway as tongue, electroscope as pale fish) feel decorative rather than causal. This density doesn't obscure closure but risks overwriting. Apply baseline artifact deduction (−0.6) for metaphor saturation across non-closure beats, keeping the score in the high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high: "blankets of hush," "light like a pearl on the tongue," "snow meant for its sleep," "fragile weather," "cloud caught in a fist," "storm maps vanishing," "delicate fracture across the sky." In several high-pressure beats (ghost dialogue, ink reading, corridor offer) metaphor stacks without clear propulsion, slowing momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "to fetch wisdom from failure" / "a wiser ending that begins again" / "weatherproof wisdom"; "counts heartbeats constantly" recurs without added pressure. Register remains consistent but elevated throughout, reducing urgency. No grammar or tense errors; some mixed vehicles ("ink crawls toward the drains and stains the floor with fleeting rivers" mixes liquid motion with geological/cartographic metaphor). Overwriting and template stems ("I [verb], and [noun] [verb]") reduce density in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies, and information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere or symbolic progression. However, multiple figurative constructions appear in most sentences without clear pattern payoff, and some metaphors stretch coherence: "meanings veer," "nouns that had gone feral," "grief had twelve small names" accumulate poetic texture but occasionally blur sense. Minor paraphrase loop: "quietly articulate" recurs in paragraph 1 and later as canyon echo ("I am quietly articulate, the canyon seemed to say") without added pressure. Template cadence: several paragraphs open with "I" + past-tense verb, creating subtle drumbeat. No catastrophic artifacts touch closure, so penalties remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in places ("the missing return changed everything, we went below"), but several lines loop conceptually: "bitterness into a cosmic joke" appears three times with slight variation, and "harmony untamed" recurs without added pressure after the first mention. The phrase "gravitationally playful" is used twice in identical contexts. Figurative density is heavy throughout ("city itself was a drum," "weather apologizing," "doorway carved by words"), occasionally stacking metaphors in adjacent lines without clear vehicle coherence. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but the mid-section carries template cadence in reflection passages.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and purposeful compression, with vivid particulars ("stone lips barely parted," "teeth of iron confessing soil") that avoid generic descriptor strings. However, figurative density pervades nearly every sentence without meaningful relief, triggering overwriting concerns: "fog stitched ladders," "air found a door," "pages" as metaphor for groan, "seedpod applause" in rapid succession. Some metaphors stretch coherence ("recruiting spider silk and rust alike" mixes material logic). Template cadence appears in the final third: multiple sentences beginning "I would [verb]" without variation. Paraphrase loops surface: "stopped performing and began signaling" is re-stated as "matched the music to my pulse" within close proximity. Information density is high but momentum suffers when every image demands equal attention. Approximately −0.8 for figurative saturation across high-pressure beats, −0.3 for template stems in closing.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs (character, world, pressure). Rhythm varies naturally with sentence length and syntactic structure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor pattern artifact: "I do not open it without need" followed by "She taught me to foster patience" leans slightly toward scaffold phrasing, but the effect is marginal and does not touch closure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges prior motifs ("the border hums a smaller song"). Clarity and momentum are sustained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm is purposefully lyric, with recurring motifs ("misting hush," "inside the chime of wind bells") that build texture. However, figurative language saturates the prose without respite—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated descriptor—creating density that slows momentum rather than accelerating it. Template cadence is evident in repeated structures ("He [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]"), and several paraphrase loops appear (e.g., the misting hush is described three times across paragraphs without new information). Patterned-artifact penalty pack (−0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops) and overwriting friction (−0.4 for figurative density without pattern payoff) apply, totaling −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "I slid my chalkboard ticket through and heard a click, not mechanical, but like a thought deciding" advances plot, world logic, and tone). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but coherent within the taught pattern. Deduction: −0.6 for elevated metaphoric saturation in peak beats without functional payoff—"lungs of shelves," "shelved the silence back into a sonnet," "filed a thunderclap"—reads as textural ornament rather than causal necessity. The closure image is clean, but mid-story density occasionally obscures immediate cause.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("candle feels a window," "knot remembering it is ribbon"). However, several beats loop conceptually: "luminous absence" recurs without new pressure, and "I do not believe in omens, only in filing systems" restates the narrator's stance mid-story without advancing it. Template cadence appears in paired constructions ("each through sunrise photography, each a patient syllable, each asking..."). Mixed metaphor in "the amplitude of morning, traveling inside the cipher as if inside a tidepool cathedral" strains coherence. Information density is generally high but some scaffold remains.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is extremely high, with metaphor in nearly every sentence ("keyring that made no sound, as if each tooth remembered a silence," "doors whispered, safes sulked," "memory chests refused their owners with a discretion that verged on contempt," "the ribbon had faded to the bruised blue of distant rain"). In peak beats—the door opening, the scholar's retrieval—elevated diction continues unabated ("improbable longing swelled between them, the way tides push the shore toward itself"), reducing propulsion and clarity. Synonym churn is visible in adjacent descriptions of the scholar's feeling: "kindness they had not dared to articulate," "unspoken mercy," "folded a feeling into neatness." Template cadence appears in the final paragraph with repeated "the [noun] [verb] its [noun]" constructions. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks, but the overwriting and register consistency across all beats lower momentum. Applying density and coherence penalties (−0.6) and template-cadence artifact (−0.5).

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character memory, or motif. Figurative language is pervasive (most sentences carry metaphor or simile) but largely coherent and voice-motivated, befitting a lyric-accumulative mode. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Clarity remains navigable despite compression. Deductions: some adjacent lines hover near paraphrase ("Memory thieves are rarely men... they are habits, ruts, tides" / "Here the bargains are written in kelp and rust") and a few metaphors stack densely in high-pressure beats without breathing room (the film/eel/coat sequence risks slight muddle). No loops that obscure causality; propulsion is steady. The final spore image recharges prior material cleanly. The density approaches but does not cross into opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and ritual mechanics simultaneously ("I steeped tea in a shallow bowl, black as handwriting, waiting for the leaves to settle into an answer"). Rhythm varies with pressure—short declaratives at peak beats ("Good, I said"), longer sinuous sentences during reflection. Minor template cadence appears in a few adjacent "I said" constructions mid-story, and one paraphrase loop near the tea-reading ("Our method is unfashionable but hard to fool, by analyzing...until they confess" is restated implicitly in the next line's triangle/circle definitions), but these do not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction—without pattern-teaching that differentiates peak beats from transit; apply −0.5 for overwriting spread. Paraphrase loops appear: "branches speak in hues" / "small bravery of buds" / "air ripened back toward color" recycle the color-as-wonder concept across adjacent beats without added pressure; apply −0.4. Template cadence runs in final third: "When grief came... When joy came... The Gray visited..." (three parallel stems); apply −0.4. Several lines blend vehicles incoherently: "moss closed its starry mouths" (mouths and stars), "bees stitched with shadow thread" (stitching bees vs. bees as needles). Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.3 in Q7. Information density is uneven—some beats advance (planting seed), others ornament (waterfall braided light). No scaffold or synonym churn in the mechanical sense, but lyric repetition without escalation drags momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and largely coherent ("nets you cannot see until your hands are already snagged," "silence accumulates the way a shore accumulates shells"). Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. However, template cadence appears in repeated sentence stems across the middle third ("I keep," "I tell," "I place," "I lift," "I press"), and some lines loop concepts without adding pressure: "Its light accumulates silence the way a shore accumulates shells, shaping and shaped by the tide" closely echoes "At night I work inside a prism sanctuary under starlight, where even breath accumulates silence." Apply −0.6 for template-cadence runs and paraphrase loops per the patterned-artifact penalty pack. No clarity break at closure, so non-closure accumulation cap limits total deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance situation and character simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully—longer accumulative sentences during investigation, shorter beats at the panel opening. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated: the henge as "worn teeth," the handle as "tongue dried mid word," rain "arguing with the past." Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor density lapse: "I asked for the address and the farmer only pointed, palm cupping a north so general it felt like refusal" is elegant but could compress slightly. Some figurative density in descriptive passages (fresco vault, saints' eyes, tidal stains) risks overwriting without pattern-teaching, though the lyric mode absorbs it. No template cadence, clean syntax, strong propulsion through the investigation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (advance discovery, layer metaphor, anchor setting). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: clipped during action ("I swam through a doorway"), extended during reflection ("He had left a note for the sea, a message housebroken by current"). Minor issues accumulate but do not touch closure: "I was quietly analytic, but grief made its proofs" reads slightly abstract; "the globe knocked my wrist as if impatient" anthropomorphizes without full embodiment; "the truth assembled itself as I hovered" tells the assembly rather than showing micro-choices. The final sequence—release, rise, math forgiveness—is clean and propulsive. No loops, no template cadence, no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Deduction totals ~−0.4 for minor tell-before-show moments in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines carry action, atmosphere, and thematic weight simultaneously. Rhythm varies naturally with minimal repetitive stems. However, slight overwriting clusters in the middle third: "a shy workshop of air and cloudwater awaiting touch" and "a parliament of whispers" approach stock lyricism, and the phrase "petals flattened earlier crackle with ozone, their veins remembering storms as if they were sheet music" stacks metaphor without adding pressure. "Singing what only the air carries" in the final line borders purple but lands as voice-consistent closure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language appears in most sentences but establishes a pattern early (graffiti as language, petals as memory) and coheres under the lens. Syntax varies purposefully; paragraph cuts are justified. Minor density slip in the overwritten metaphor cluster: −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, stakes, or atmosphere without padding. Sentence rhythm varies naturally—short fragments for urgency ("Fourth floor, fifth; cables sang"), longer constructions for reflection. Figurative language is dense but controlled and purposeful: "winter throat clearing for a whispered confession," "frost ferns warmed by a distant hearth," "field notes on sorrow, a survey of ravines and lifts." One minor density issue: "I felt the guilty tremor a string feels when plucked by a ghost" stacks two metaphors in close succession without clear narrative payoff for the second vehicle. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each beat propels. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly; the final image ("letters finally settle into sleep") recharges prior motifs without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The graphite line trembles with the gondola as if the absence were breathing back" fuses action, perception, and thematic charge). Rhythm varies naturally and accelerates at key beats. Minor scaffold detected: "I whisper the categories again and again until they become a liturgy for air" followed immediately by the litany itself is a near-paraphrase loop (−0.3). One instance of slight overwriting: "a pressure bloom so gentle it can lift us for hours" leans decorative in the opening without immediate causal work. No major loops or artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines layer action, image, and interiority. Rhythm varies with pressure (short bursts at "I quicken without hurriedness" shift to longer breaths in the final paragraph). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Minor overwriting in mid-section: several adjacent lines deploy extended metaphors ("Graphite dust blooms like night," "lines emerge fractally precise," "pattern echoes growth rings") without break, risking density saturation. One template echo: repeated "I [verb]" stems cluster briefly around the painting sequence. Closure beat is clean and propulsive; artifacts do not touch it.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies sentence-to-sentence, and paragraph breaks create visual breathing room. Information density is high: most lines advance image, character, or discovery. However, paraphrase loops appear: "I listen to what does not speak" echoes "talking to the sky is how I keep company without asking anyone to stay"; "stranded luminance, a rumor of light that gets lost and never dims" is restated as "bright as a procession yet homeless, an exile of radiance." Figurative saturation in the net sequence (hums in ten languages, tone scratches ribs, glow crawls, craving paper as harbor) muddles the physical action, obscuring whether the apprentice manually guides the strand or it moves autonomously. Template cadence in cumulative "and" chains (lines 17–19, 23–24) flattens propulsion. Apply −0.8 for loops and metaphor density touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: nearly every sentence layers metaphor (hoarfrost, goblets, buoys, chalked names, gulls, harbors). While many images are evocative and voice-consistent, the sheer accumulation without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure risks overwriting—"palms chafed by wind that smelled like old tin and rain," "stacks answered with a hush that felt like driftwood nostalgia," "chime drifted up through the stacks like a buoy in cloud tides" cluster without a unifying vehicle or physical grounding. Template cadence appears in runs: "He searched… then knelt… He read… He took… He fit…" Template-cadence penalty (−0.5) and density without anchor (−0.4) apply. No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks, and information density is solid, but the relentless metaphor accumulation in high-pressure beats lowers momentum and triggers the overwriting check.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence runs. Information density is high, with figurative language doing double duty (arches as trellises, bell as vow with wings). Minor loop: "watched the orchards sip and swell, watched children tilt their heads… watched elders sit" recycles "watched" without added pressure. One register drift: "that brambled hope we had learned not to chase" breaks the lyric texture with an abstraction. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains high. The final chalk message ("reexamine what you call haunting") risks abstraction but is anchored to the artifact and integrated into the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm is purposeful and paragraph structure varies to support the accumulative design. However, multiple lines restate the same content without adding pressure: "not by erasing them, but by breathing around them" / "to be found by sleepers yet unborn" / "kept them company in their earliest dark" loop the lullaby concept without new detail. The final third contains a run of template cadence ("I lift… I take… I do not crave… So I vouchsafe… I hum… I touch") that dulls propulsion during the closure sequence. Figurative density is high without consistent payoff: "time's final ripple," "nested rings that drink the dusk," "warm tide washing the mechanism clean" mix vehicles and blur causality. Apply baseline artifact deduction (−0.6) and proximity to closure (−0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (image, motive, world rule). Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives at peak beats, longer syntactic waves in reflection. Minor template cadence appears in the traveler-guidance passage ("I shook…I snapped…I spoke…I flicked") but propulsion holds and the pattern reads as tactical sequence under time pressure. No paraphrase loops. Figurative language is controlled and vehicle-coherent: "rust resents salt," "trees drank the cliff's marrow." Opening and closing lines charge prior motifs. Zero scaffolding or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("streams laced and unlaced like nerves remembering a song," "grief loosen like a knot warmed by breath"). Information density is high. Minor overwriting cluster in the opening third: "zipper of departure," "lengthened like winter," "muted C" stack metaphor without clear pressure. Template-stem run: "She told him…He picked up…She nodded…They stepped" appears in the brother's arrival sequence (~4 adjacent beats, −0.4). No paraphrase loops or major filter-verb stacks. Clarity at closure is clean. Figurative density in early exposition slightly drags momentum but does not obscure cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("silver bow, then right itself, like a reed after wind"), with strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is solid; most lines advance atmosphere or concept. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "I wanted to find the place where stories begin" is restated as "What absence could I offer, to purchase my way into the place where stories begin?" without added pressure; "It sounded like..." is repeated across two adjacent lines with synonym variation but no causal advance. Template cadence appears in the stack of "Parole as in..." constructions mid-story. These artifacts dull momentum in the middle third and touch near the closure zone ("It sounded like..."), triggering higher penalties per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines advance character, world, and pressure simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; openings vary and syntax modulates with scene needs. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "little mirrors someone could drown inside without water," "coral rose out, pale and frozen as if remembering winter." Deductions: two or three metaphors approach opacity under pressure ("ribs of a leviathan" for dunes, "hollows whispering frost") and occasional elevated diction ("heresy of ocean trapped in thirst") slightly exceeds the POV's working register in peak beats, risking a −0.5 cumulative artifact penalty in high-pressure lines.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often effective ("wheat bows to wind," "elevator loomed, a siloed organ") but clusters heavily in many lines without always advancing pressure. Template stems recur: "she [verb], [object]" patterns and "The [noun] [verb]-ed" constructions appear across multiple beats. Paraphrase loops surface: "elevator talks began" / "elevator talks thickened" / "grain elevator talks again" without clear escalation between instances. Propulsion slows in the middle third when exposition ("That was why she kept the choral library") interrupts momentum. No major causality break, but cumulative line-level drag prevents higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high, with most lines advancing memory excavation or apparatus detail, but the piece suffers from template cadence in adjacent lines: multiple sentences open with "I [verb]" patterns across the middle third, and synonym loops appear ("entangled memories" recurs without reweighting). Figurative language is dense and occasionally mixed: "helix-minded engineer" works, but "thread silver through canyon," "unspool logic from trembling filaments," and "braided their way" cluster metaphors of weaving, threading, and coiling without clear vehicle coherence. The final packing image is clean and propulsive. Register drift into clinical terminology ("synaptic plasticity," "theta waves," "microvolt") clashes with the lyric frame at peak beats, and the phrase "quaking reverie" appears three times, once as ornament in the opening line.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied, with strong imagery ("stalactites rose like candles," "lake of smoke"). However, synonym loops and paraphrase chains appear: "clandestinely luminous" recurs four times without causal escalation; "seeds of vigilance" appears three times in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence in the middle third: "I [verb], and [noun] [verb]" runs across multiple beats without taught pattern. Figurative density is high but occasionally muddles ("threshold effects" remains abstract; "prism-minded" is never concretized). These artifacts touch the mid-section but not the closure image, warranting deduction without disqualifying 9+ globally. Applying −0.8 for loop/cadence issues and −0.3 for figurative abstraction in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Information density is high; lines often perform multiple jobs (e.g., "Its glazed body remembers storms, and memory is a resonant thing" establishes object history and thematic resonance). Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer reflective sentences ("I learned the names of fractures...") breathing between shorter action beats. Figurative language is dense in places—"river gathering its coat," "pressure migrates," "sympathy of materials"—but most images clarify rather than obscure. Minor scaffold appears in parallel stems ("I offer it to the river... I offer it to the hedgehog... I offer it to the grove"), a taught pattern that pays off thematically but nears repetition. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs elsewhere. Closure beats are clear and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("words had become tariffs," "pauses print their characters on metal," "light that does not leave entirely"), and while individual images are vivid, the accumulation in nearly every sentence risks opacity during peak beats—lines like "She lifted a knight and held it to the aurora until it learned its route" beautify but slow propulsion. The final paragraph sustains metaphor ("tipped my king, not as surrender, but as a poured libation") without clarifying mechanics. Rhythm varies and information density is strong, but the overwriting in high-pressure moments (correlating, translating silence) triggers the density check: −0.5 in Q7 for pervasive figurative layering without taught pattern payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and sometimes stacks without breathing room: "stage curtains," "pyre than prose," "scaffolding of constellations," "choir of broken clocks," "country," "lungs to pace their miracles," "forgiving bees"—all within the first half. Several metaphors are coherent individually but accumulate to near-overwriting (−0.5 range for density without pattern-payoff at closure). Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines: "Silence number two… Silence number three" functions as catalog but borders on template cadence. Information density is high; no loops or scaffolding beyond the intentional list structure. Propulsion slows in the middle third as the narrator narrates aloud without advancing the clasp's state.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, with many lines doing double duty (journalizing calms her; doodles let thinking breathe). However, the piece carries template-cadence artifacts: runs of "she + [verb]" structures, and several paraphrase loops ("motion rested, as if held" echoes "serenity within motion" without added pressure). Figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats (the bloom, the ceremony) without clear pattern payoff, triggering density and register-drift penalties. The final third remains legible but the metaphoric density ("tide's thought," "braided hands," "reed flute") slightly blurs propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance setting, character, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer breath-units during ascent and tighter syntax at the repair. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is controlled and mostly embodied ("pears lift sighing," "arches open their throats"), though a few ornamental moments ("drips crawl upward...like silver insects," "knotted ropes of air") edge toward overwriting without disrupting momentum. Propulsion is strong through the climax, with clear sequence and no scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances forensic logic or atmospheric charge. Rhythm varies naturally, supporting the accumulative lens. Minor scaffold in the middle third: "The survey grows into a map of decisions, some human, some weather, and some that belong to both" abstracts what has been shown. A handful of participle openers ("Ribboned telltales," "I clip") risk simultaneity, though the effect is minor. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. The final beats are clean and propulsive. Figurative language (port as lung, containers as streets, wind as ally) remains coherent and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("bells threw prisms like minnows," "hush stood, timid as a foal"), but several mixed metaphors obscure sense: "city above murmured, stone by stone, as if rehearsing an argument with time" blurs agency. Paraphrase loops appear: "I unrolled the amber music sheet, and its golden script ticked" is immediately followed by "I struck the first bell...and the tone went rose, then rain," restating preparation-to-action twice. Template cadence is present in repeated "I [verb]" stems across the middle third. Information density is high, yet some lines ("Down here, frostfare waited on my breath") add atmosphere without advancing situation. No scaffolding or generation artifacts visible, and the final line ("awaiting the next first strike") lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse; information density is high. Most lines do double or triple duty (e.g., "The floods had once thrown driftwood here, ghosts of trees polished into bone" gives history, image, and stakes). Clarity is strong throughout. Two distinct frictions lower the score: (1) paraphrase loop at lines 29–30 ("This is not pardon, it is practice" followed by "the craft of not breaking what wants to hold" restates without added pressure), and (2) a template-cadence run in the final block where several lines begin with similar syntactic stems ("I came," "I will cross," "I lay," "I keep"). These artifacts appear in non-closure beats and do not dull the ending image, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 total in Q7 only. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-taught payoff at closure, triggering overwriting deductions (−0.5). Multiple paraphrase loops: "vanishing stars" recurs decoratively across eight beats without evolving function; "transposed empathy" is restated in varied metaphors (chord, crossing, swapping of bearings) within adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence runs: "He said… He called… He placed… He wrote…" and "We worked… We tested… We kept… We left…" for six consecutive sentence openers in the middle third (−0.6). Line-level clarity is adequate, but information density is low—many sentences restate the core concept (empathy as math) without advancing situation or choice. The artifacts do not obscure the closure image but pervade the supporting moves, capping the score and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (the pendant "extends brief encounters" while also being "part insect, part tuning fork"). Rhythm varies purposefully, breathing during reflection and tightening during the woman's encounter. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. One density concern: "by vibrating sympathetically" appears in lines 5, 18, and implicitly in 9, with the second instance feeling redundant given prior establishment. A minor register drift occurs in "rescue one bright pulse from the gray"—the metaphor edge feels slightly elevated against the earthier "sorting stones" texture. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, though "extends brief encounters without stealing time" borders on explaining the mechanic rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies well—long descriptive arcs give way to short declaratives at turns ("The prism flared, mild as dawn"). High information density in most lines. Two pattern issues: "shifted hush" appears identically twice without evolution, and the phrase "firmly grounded" echoes in structure with "patient witness" and "truthful lies" in a way that feels template-learned rather than voice-organic. The overwriting is restrained but present: "the scent of last summer reminding you your mouth once knew sweetness" stretches past necessity. No loops or scaffolding; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or ritual action. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (raveling silence, soft knives, filament) is coherent. However, several phrasesLoop or paraphrase: "stoically sparkling" appears three times with minimal variation; "raveling silence" recurs without reweighting; "through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" bookends without added pressure. Template cadence in the ritual sequence (one by one she nested, she whispered, she spoke, she untied) flattens momentum slightly. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull line-level propulsion in the middle third, triggering baseline deduction in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create visual and aural variety. Information density is high—most lines advance image, choice, or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and mostly grounded: silk "caught light like water," fear "a quiet animal," drift "like white moths." Minor density issue: a few adjacent lines paraphrase without adding pressure ("It sounded like a place I could make by hand, one deliberate hour at a time" closely echoes prior closure sentiment). Template-cadence check: no runs of identical stems. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. Proofreading is clean. The loop penalty is minimal but present.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but purposeful: "routes braid like threads," "bay opens like a ribcage," "taste like sea glass thawing on the tongue." Overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("braid shows three faint paths, each slightly offset, like fingerprints pressed from parallel hands") where vehicles multiply without added clarity. Template cadence runs in the middle third: "I [verb]… I [verb]… I [verb]" across multiple lines. Minor paraphrase loop: "I split my attention and slip where the scents diverge" followed immediately by three parallel-universe descriptions that restate the same split. Information density is high but artifacts in non-closure beats prevent 8+ entry. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: −0.6 for template cadence and minor loop.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances setting, character stance, or the letter-chain logic. Rhythm varies purposefully—long accumulative sentences ("Some letters were instructions, like a way of stacking stones...") alternate with terse beats ("So I went"). No paraphrase loops. Minor issues: "The haunted lantern room waited for me like a lung with a held breath" then "sighed as if it remembered a child"—two lung/breath metaphors in close proximity. "After the lamp flickers out" is frame-quoted three times, borderline template cadence but serves as ritual anchor. Filter verbs ("I wanted to protect") appear sparingly and voice-motivated. One small clarity slip: "the inked mouths of the letters" reads initially unclear until context (oil-soaking) resolves it.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density and vivid figurative language ("a pulse of shadowed elation at the edge of my teeth," "the gyre, pleased, leans back into open water") sustain momentum. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. However, metaphor density in several consecutive lines ("a choir of prisms, a promise written in rotating glass" immediately followed by more figurative constructions) borders on overwriting without always advancing cause-effect, costing eligibility for 8.5+. Propulsion remains strong, and the final image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer sentences for contemplation and shorter for realization. Minor deductions for three instances of paraphrase loops: "Color lives in structure" / "stories live in the angles between breaths" restates the same concept; "the way light dragged across my pulse" / "tracking sun trails" recurs without added pressure in two adjacent beats. No template cadence or register drift. Opening and closing lines charge the frame effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The forest ringed the tower, shouldering lightning, nodding through seasons like elders who know names" delivers setting, atmosphere, and the witness theme). Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is consistent with voice. A few lines verge on overwriting—"green radiographs," "beaded curtain of patience"—but remain legible and serve the lyric mode. No loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. The final line—"some work is finished simply by being carried to the light"—offers a clean, resonant closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high and sentences frequently do multiple jobs: "The laugh is gold; it coats my tongue, and the mica window shivers, yearning" advances sensory texture, object state, and readiness for the next beat. Rhythm varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops appear. Minor template cadence emerges in the village-song sequence: "The parents answer," "Grandmothers hum," "grandfathers murmur" uses parallel stems but serves the collective accumulation. One register drift in "a murmuration of sparks" briefly elevates beyond the keeper's established idiom. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "dawn threads spume out like rivers tasting day" mixes liquid and sensory metaphors without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines layer action, perception, and thematic imagery. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm modulates with scene pressure. However, repetitive syntactic stems appear in the middle section ("She saw...," "She realized...," "She felt...") and a paraphrase loop occurs when "staying while leaving" is restated three times without added pressure. Stock metaphors like "soft moons" and "quiet mirrors" accumulate without pattern payoff. No major scaffold, but the cumulative texture debt and template cadence in the reflection block (-0.6) prevent entry into the 7.5+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and aural cadence. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Two deductions: (1) repetitive syntactic stems in the middle third ("We begin," "We uncloak," "We decide," "We recloak") create template cadence (−0.5), and (2) a handful of paraphrase loops (e.g., "guerrilla gardening" recurs without evolving function, "tenuous" explained twice). Minor figurative muddle: "the loaf's last warmth rides beside my heartbeat" strains credibility. No clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift between noun, prepositional, and subordinate constructions. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, task, or interiority without padding. Figurative language is dense ("catalog cards laminated with hoarfrost curled like tired tongues," "frequency rang true, a steady bell beyond the gale") but controlled and legible, though the accumulation ("magic lantern slide," "luminous vows," "quartz hush," "avalanches sighed," "sky flexed its blue ribs") risks overwriting in the middle third. A minor paraphrase loop: "Sometimes the signal arrived… Sometimes nothing came" echoes structure without added pressure. No template cadence or therapy-speak. The final line ("our own luminous vows carved across the cold") reprises motifs cleanly. Pronoun references are clear; tense is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: "He set a crate between us, wood swollen, iron nails blooming with orange" does setting, status, and decay. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Two minor issues prevent higher band entry: "curiously steadfast" appears four times without functional variation, creating a phrase-loop artifact. "Comforting unease" in paragraph one and "a comfort that let unease speak only the truth" near closure echo without added pressure—mild paraphrase loop. Neither touches the closure beat's core mechanics (the fob clipped, the shoreline steps), so capped deduction applies. No filter stacks, no template cadence, strong propulsion overall.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("Earth's own spine drinking star milk," "fog of orphaned glaciers"), but clusters of adjacent metaphors in high-pressure beats risk muddle without adding propulsion. Sentence openings vary, and spatial choreography is clean. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "I tasted the air" recurs with slight variations, and "emergent compass" is restated in the final paragraph without new pressure. The closing lines shift into expository summary ("What I wanted to know had been there all along") that tells rather than shows the narrator's realization. No severe artifacts, but density occasionally trades clarity for texture.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in mechanical beats (lock, string, hinge, key). However, figurative language pervades nearly every sentence ("auroral sorrow," "charcoal music," "pre-dawn bruise," "crystals purpling," "water finds its level"), creating a steady lyric wash that somewhat flattens urgency at the climactic unlock and drawing moments. Several paraphrase loops: "I am mnemonically gifted, cursed to store details that refuse to gray out" echoes "a gallery that always stays lit" two lines later without added pressure. Template stems recur ("I am…," "The…") across opening and closing thirds.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high, and most lines advance atmosphere or action. However, several beats show paraphrase loops: "The routes converged...I went alone...At the Ear, I slid..." mechanically sequences actions without layering pressure, and "I found the evidence everyone insists does not exist, a puzzle that promised direction" restates the map discovery without added detail. Figurative language clusters in the Ear sequence—panels "trembling," "hush lifted like dust," ribbon "coiling"—approach overwriting but remain coherent. Template cadence appears in the confession list: "I told...how I hoard / I confessed I reread / I admitted I once gilded." Apply −0.6 for paraphrase and template runs per the penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop or paraphrase: "whispering bluff above the clouds" appears three times; "color of wonder" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence is mild but present in the middle third: "A woman clutched... A man slumped... Children leaned..." The figurative density is high throughout ("rivers of mist," "aurora bowed its head," "clouds... bottoms bruised purple") without creating coherence issues, but in peak beats (fragment melting, crowd's emotional releases) the imagery occasionally competes with clarity rather than sharpening it. No major loops or scaffold, yet the prose does not achieve the tightness required for the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, pressure, or image. Rhythm varies purposefully (clipped during burn, expansive in reflection). Minor pattern artifact: several sentences open with "I [verb]" in the middle third, creating momentary template cadence. A few metaphors stack without clear payoff ("needle teeth scratching," "tiny locks opening," "yellow teeth nibbling")—vivid but occasionally ornamental. No loops or scaffold; propulsion stays strong. The closure beat is clean and imagistically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("dust swirled like hush," "a grainy rattle, like wind inside a thimble," "a click like a teardrop touching wood"). However, template cadence runs appear across multiple lines ("I am a discerning thrift-store curator," "I lead through following," "I am trained to read stains") with identical "I [verb/state]" stems, triggering −0.5. Stock metaphors ("sandstorm calm," "ears catch seasons") and elevated diction in peak beats ("mosaic showed Maria's pattern," "mutual aid ledger") muddle immediacy without consistent POV grounding, adding −0.4 for register drift. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but several sentences restate the theme ("listening heals," "hear the room like a heartbeat," "listen first") without added pressure. Information density is high in the locket and mailbox beats, partially offsetting artifacts. No loops touch the closure image directly, so deductions remain within-band.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and purposeful, with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths that create visual and auditory cadence. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (advance plot, deepen character, charge motif)—but several beats loop conceptually: "encrypt vulnerability as strength" appears three times with slight rephrasing, and "as a spider spins its web" recurs as a refrain without added pressure in middle instances. Template-cadence runs are minimal, yet figurative language is dense in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (e.g., "message fish," "body of light," "hidden city lifting"), risking register drift and occasional opacity. No paraphrase loops across adjacent lines, and the opening/closing images are strong. Deduct −0.5 for metaphor density that requires inferential work during peak action and −0.3 for conceptual repetition without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is densely imagistic with high information load ("Crystals hang like unfinished bells, ringing only if you touch them with careful skin"). Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is mostly coherent. However, two adjacent sentences in the opening third effectively restate the whale's gravitational effect ("flame licks sideways… as if weight has shifted" / "harbor is riddled with pockets of gravity") without added pressure, triggering a −0.2 paraphrase penalty. Minor template cadence in the council sequence ("workers ran wires… machine drank the ache… redacted faces, erased lullabies") but the pattern is brief and does not pervade. No major loop or scaffold artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm is controlled and sentences vary in length and structure. Information density is generally high, though some lines loop concepts: "hush a prophecy spoken in code" appears three times with minor variation, and "tranquil blaze" recurs without evolving function. Figurative language is dense (every paragraph carries metaphor or simile) but largely coherent; one mixed moment: "smoothed hush gathered like dew, a skin of calm that could bear delicate steps" conflates liquid and solid without clear vehicle. Elevated diction ("terrestrially cosmic," "lucid intention scrawled through weather") drifts toward abstraction in peak beats, reducing immediacy. No severe artifacts, but density and register constrain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, relationship, and the learning dynamic simultaneously. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and voice-motivated (garden as library, meteors as punctuation lessons). Minor deductions: some constructions approach ornamental ("streaks like signatures written too fast to be forgery" restates the punctuation metaphor without adding pressure); a few filter verbs ("felt its vowels," "heard the roof sigh") slightly dull immediacy in peak moments. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Rhythm modulates appropriately with scene pressure. Strong propulsion overall despite occasional decorative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence structures shift from short declarations ("She believed sound could open doors") to long, layered images ("Jars hold lullabies that burned, portraits with erased eyes, promises that exploded into fragrant shrapnel"). Information density is high—most lines advance metaphor, action, or atmosphere. Minor artifact: mild paraphrase in the archive-aisles passage where "dew numbers each grief" and the jar descriptions restate containment without new pressure. A few elevated phrases ("tragically radiant," "quarantined memory") trend toward stock lyricism. No loops touch the closure beat; the final paragraph's propulsion is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("aurora combed green fire," "letters cast their own laments"), but the frequency—metaphor or simile in most sentences—reduces propulsion in key beats. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("I came to forgive the unfinished" / "To forgive the unfinished also meant..."). Syntax varies purposefully and grammar is clean. Information density is high, but overwriting in the forging sequence (lines 17–26) dampens momentum. No generation artifacts or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("cliffs felt like ribs around a vast heart," "a map folded inside a breath"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "I wanted to learn why some people echo..." restates the quest twice in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs cluster in the council sequence: "They asked... I told... The tallest nodded... I heard... I sang... They revealed..." across six consecutive beats, triggering a −0.5 deduction. Mixed metaphors muddle clarity: "my song learned to crawl" personifies song, then "walls coiled... serpentine in patience" mixes coiling (movement) with patience (abstract quality). Stock phrases like "webs of intrigue" and "the universe hums its secret song" (repeated thrice) feel ornamental. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: template cadence (−0.5), paraphrase loop (−0.2), stock metaphor strings (−0.3) = −1.0 total in Q7, plus loops/cadence touch the council confrontation, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; lines layer action, setting, and interiority without redundancy. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful ("ice holds a quiet that listens harder," "candles bob like buoys") with no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm varies, accelerating in the ghost's arrival and slowing for the final promise. Minor paraphrase loop in "windows of connection" repeated across three paragraphs without added pressure each time (lines 10, 32, 47)—functional but not always propulsive. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; clarity and momentum are maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most sentences do two jobs). Overwriting density issue: figurative language is dense throughout ("soft bead slid along string," "silk scraped from a chrysalis," "ink poured into water") without always advancing pressure, triggering −0.4. A few near-loops appear ("whispered" / "whispering," "demure audacity" repeated from opening to widow's gesture) but do not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Closure beat ("bristles remembering the foam's brief constellations") is clean and propulsive. The elevated register is consistent and voice-motivated, so no register-drift penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean and propulsive with strong imagery: "auction flags were still tangled in the thorny rows," "a faint ticking like cooled glass." Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances discovery or atmosphere. Minor scaffold: "I asked about the diamond, and Klay looked at the ground like it might answer for him. He said the stone was cursed because..." could be tighter; the transition leans explanatory. One paraphrase loop: "The orchard was not a miracle, but a net" is immediately followed by restating its function. Sentence openings vary well, and figurative language remains controlled except for one metaphor stack in the stillpoint description that slightly blurs momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is densely figurative and rhythmically controlled, with vivid images that advance atmosphere and character stance. However, overwriting clusters in nearly every paragraph: "stormlight crawled, tracing neighborhoods that beat in unwieldy harmonies," "ash toned music through fragmented radio frequencies," "paper storm crane." In the climax, mixed metaphors accumulate ("crack the glass like a cathedral confession," "batons fell like rain gutters") and some phrases loop conceptually ("lyrically prophetic" appears three times). Information density is high but the figurative load occasionally obscures causal linkage (how the crowd's choice "held" is told, not shown). Template cadence is minimal, but the relentless elevation in diction at peak beats triggers −0.5 under the Overwriting penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentence rhythm varies purposefully, figurative language is vivid and mostly coherent ("sand whispering through the rafters like restless coins," "melody stumbled out like a child relearning how to walk the alphabet"), and information density is high. Clarity and concision are maintained across most beats. However, scattered mixed or strained metaphors reduce precision: "lightning wrote its crooked essay" pairs awkwardly with "language comes wet from the breakers and dries into bridges" in tonal register, and "silences rough as rope" feels forced. Template cadence appears in mid-section with repeated "I [verb]" openings across adjacent sentences (cleaned, set, climbed, arranged). Paraphrase loop detected: "to become the translator between generations" restated as "carry more bridges in bottles across the seasons." Deductions total approximately −0.8 for artifact presence and mixed metaphor, keeping the score in the 7.5–7.7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Template cadence appears in three consecutive "I [verb]" openers during the descent ("So I opened… I placed… I hummed"), triggering a −0.4 baseline deduction. Minor figurative density in the hum sequence ("time like wet hair," "ribs with equal courtesy," "dust of decades") verges on overwriting but remains coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: "sonic absolution" is defined twice (lines 9 and 25) without added pressure. Proofreading is clean; no loops or scaffolding obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language (caldera rim, breath as slow congregation, bridge as sleeping animal) charges key beats without muddle. Information density is high. However, scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "I stand my watch to sculpt patience" echoes "To sculpt patience from impatience is my labor"; "We live in a restrained wildness" returns as "I keep my watch with a restrained wildness"; "the opening, the held breath, the pause between tugs" cycles synonym variants. Template cadence runs in the final third: "We still run…but we choose…" "I keep my watch…" "The horizon keeps…" "We unyoke…" Filter-verb stacks ("I chart," "I ask," "I say," "I show," "I answer") dull immediacy in the council sequence. These patterns lower propulsion and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines serve multiple functions (e.g., "the contractor belongs to the director's brother-in-law, a name that appears in my files like a watermark on bad paper" advances plot, character stance, and metaphor). Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer contemplative lines punctuated by clipped investigative observations. Minor issues: a few figurative constructions risk density without full payoff ("entangled memories braid themselves around the beam" is evocative but slightly abstract; "the echoes do not sort" approaches metaphor muddle). Paraphrase near the end: "I stay watchfully calm" echoes the opening "watchfully calm" without cost accumulation in that exact moment. No loops or scaffold elsewhere; propulsion holds.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives at key turns ("Take it"), longer accumulative sentences during reflection. "Vibrant hush" appears three times; the third use adds "like theater lights held before the curtain lifts," which recharges the phrase, but the second mention is decorative. Light scaffold in "I told her about Hector, about the letter"—the "about" stem could vary. No loops or major artifacts touch closure. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines do double duty (world, character, plot). Minor loop: "transliterate" appears three times in similar syntactic positions without escalating function; "irreverently awed" and "irreverent awe" recur as near-synonyms. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; occasional mixed vehicles ("sea tastes me back" after "sea licks the rafters") blur specificity. No grammatical errors or pronoun drift; sequencing is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "seventeen stars, a looping orbit stitched like a noose" carries symbol, image, and foreshadowing). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during descent and breathing in the final commute. Minor issue: some figurative density in mid-section ("weather" recurs as metaphor four times without pattern payoff). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs cleanly. One template cadence run: "In the first…In the second…In the third" is functional but mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stake. Strategic telling compresses transit ("I climbed down to the hamlet") efficiently. Figurative language is mostly controlled ("ice floes…like arguments that had forgotten their beginnings"), though "shadow-laced" and "courageous anomaly" approach stock metaphor without full transformation. Paraphrase loop in final third: "I stood…a quiet seam" restates "In that seam lies the work" within two paragraphs, and template stems ("I asked…I told…I pocketed…I sent…I stood") stack across the resolution sequence. Minor filter-verb clustering ("I felt the heartbeat," "I believed then") in reflective beats. No hard artifacts touch closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative density is purposeful but occasionally stacks without rest: "consonants of collapse and the vowels of hush," "future reverse in the squeal of wet reels," "feathery quiet that kept arriving like snow." Most images clarify rather than obscure, and the piece teaches its lyric pattern early. Minor loop: "a fold in patience" recurs three times with slight variation; the repetition charges the motif but edges toward churn. Information density is high; no scaffold. Syntax varies, and the final line propels without summarizing. The overwriting remains voice-motivated and does not flatten the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and carries momentum through the encounter, and information density is high (most lines advance image, counsel, or stance). A cluster of filter-adjacent constructions in the middle third ("see they are ready," "ask what I lost," "show how in winter") dulls immediacy slightly but does not obscure causality. Figurative language is dense ("thorned by cold," "moon stitched with moonlight," "lodge small claims against dark") and mostly coherent, though "answer gently persuasive" in the sixth line borders on abstract. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. The libation beat and phone-call choreography are propulsive. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor deduction for filter stack and one register drift ("intersubjective") that momentarily displaces the vineyard idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "dunes hummed like glass ribs," "voices tuned to soothed sighs," "child whose laughter stuttered like a bright fish," "parapet rolled like a slow jointed tide." While individually vivid, the sustained metaphoric texture in nearly every line creates pattern-based overwriting that risks obscuring rather than propelling action—particularly in the middle third where causality slows. Template cadence appears in runs: "The fabric carried… a few raw ones… Lio walked… as if… She said… I had been sent…" (−0.4). Minor paraphrase loop: "murmuring pavilion" / "pavilion murmured back" at the opening. Clarity remains mostly intact, but information density suffers when figurative language layers without advancing situation. No scaffold or copy errors; syntax varies purposefully. Propulsion recovers in the final third as concrete actions (conjuring clearings, tying threads) take precedence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density; sentences often do multiple jobs (e.g., "We curved the lines into a corridor of memory that opened like a shell" advances spatial logic, metaphor, and collective action). Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is concentrated but coherent. Minor deductions: a few near-paraphrases ("the mirrors stopped being glass and became windows" follows "I saw the town seeing itself" closely) and occasional elevated diction in peak beats ("thrummed like violin strings tuned to rain") that slightly drifts from the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or stance. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (echoes "dressed in its own echo," waves folding into unborn neighbors) is coherent. Deductions: paraphrase loops appear ("suspended hush" recurs six times without evolving meaning; "sonically reflective" is restated across beats without fresh pressure). Template cadence in mid-section: "He had watched… he had traced" runs identical stems. Figurative density in some beats (morning dust, pear-shaped shard, low meadow of replies) trends ornamental without pattern payoff. Net −0.8 for loops and template stems touching non-closure beats. Closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: most lines advance image, stake, or character (e.g., "He whispered: I am clinging to echoes, do not let them peel away"). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the amphitheater sequence and breathing in the final departure. Minor loop issue: "arranging driftwood as directional markers" appears three times with near-identical phrasing, creating template cadence that dulls momentum slightly (−0.4). No other scaffolding or mixed metaphors; figurative language remains coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: most lines layer action, image, and thematic charge (e.g., "the hand dials through centuries in a minute, smearing any hope of capture"). Rhythm varies naturally, though a few adjacent sentences repeat structure ("I set exposures… and the cameras took…" / "Some grains surrendered… and some reached…"). No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Minor figurative muddle: "luminous ache" recurs but remains legible. Zero scaffold; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; lines do multiple jobs (the shard is prayer, weapon, memory, pick). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at the closure beat. Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("sky leans close as witness," "breath poured around it") without full pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in the hymning passages ("I sing about…I sing her…") and one paraphrase loop ("pulsing stillness" repeated). No loops touch the closure beat directly, so cap deductions at −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance ritual logic, world rules, or thematic charge. Sentence openings vary; paragraph rhythm breathes with the ritual stages. Minor figurative density in passages like "a bowl of noon that pools with lost silhouettes" and "smallest consent click" borders on overwriting but remains legible and voice-integrated. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. A few aphoristic constructions ("humility is the shortest circle") risk register drift, but the closure image is clean. Proofreading is solid; grammar and punctuation are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "mismatched twins," "bones ask to be believed," "cradle creaked with a stranger's weight," "laugh sounded like water finding its channel." In the garden descent and chamber beats, metaphor appears in nearly every sentence without escalating clarity or pressure—this reads as pattern-taught lyricism rather than overwriting, but it risks flattening momentum. A paraphrase loop occurs: "shrewdly innocent" is used identically for Mara (paragraph 7) and the boy (paragraph 28), blurring distinction. The final paragraph summarizes the narrator's stance rather than closing on image, slightly deflating propulsion. No major loops or scaffold, but information density could tighten in the reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("coils like a map of patient stars," "a lung of stone now soothed"). However, several lines loop: "As memories resurface" appears twice as a transitional phrase without added content. "The mist keeps its promise and drifts slowly" and "When the wind presses the mist thin" recycle mist-movement imagery. Template cadence in the final third: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "I [verb]" without variation. Filter-verb stack is minimal. Propulsion is steady but not urgent; some beats ("I told them only that the sea had lent us a word") summarize rather than dramatize. Paraphrase-loop penalty −0.2; template-cadence penalty −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously (e.g., "I trace the aisles between racks and trunks, reading the floor for a pattern left by drip of thawing icicles"). Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift, and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. No paraphrase loops or template stems. Figurative language is controlled and grounded: "honeyed hush," "amber pendant...a small honey lake," "soft code" all cohere without mixed metaphors. Two issues lower the score: (1) "It is not penance…it is practice, a daily rebalancing" becomes slightly expository at a peak beat, telling what the prior grafting actions have already shown; (2) "Every stitch feels like a revision, a careful clause that lets the page breathe without erasing the first hand" stacks two metaphors (stitch-as-revision, clause-as-breath) in one sentence, creating minor density without added clarity. Both occur mid-story; the closure beat remains artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances metaphor, image, or thematic charge. Figurative language saturates the piece—river as meaning-migration, pages as tide, wolves as ink—without a taught pattern that justifies such density in every beat, triggering mild overwriting risk (−0.3). Mixed metaphor appears once: "pages that wanted to close over my knees" conflates liquid and solid in a way that strains coherence (−0.3). Paraphrase loops are minimal; no template cadence. Sentence openings vary purposefully, and paragraph rhythm breathes with the accumulative design. The phrase "ephemeral cameo appearances" recurs as a motif but borders on scaffolding when repeated in close succession. Clarity remains high despite the lyric compression; cause/effect is traceable under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied; sentence openings shift ("Lio lifted," "He selected," "Around a branch," "The moon sank"). Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every line carries metaphor or simile—but remains legible and pattern-taught (nature-as-syntax). Template-cadence runs appear: "He spoke...He spun...He sang...He pressed...He used...He touched" (seven consecutive "He" stems in the ritual sequence) trigger the −0.5 penalty for template cadence. Paraphrase loops are minimal; information density is moderate (ritual detail layered) but some lines restate without added pressure ("The remedy would not be complete until the old vow was spoken" followed by the child's observation that effectively restates the same need). No severe line-level opacity; artifacts do not obscure closure but dull mid-sequence propulsion. Deduction: −0.6 for template stems, −0.2 for minor paraphrase loop = −0.8 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("moving stillness," "pulse could draw a road," "winter riverbed"). Some adjacent lines restate without adding pressure: "She had learned to hear his far heartbeat in storms, a faint tapping that visited her bones like a traveling knock" closely echoes the prior map-via-pulse conceit. A few filter verbs ("She could almost hear") and elevated constructions ("memory enough to mark beats on the air") slightly dull immediacy. Information density is high; no major loops or scaffolding, but the relentless metaphorical texture risks overwriting in a piece where clarity of action matters.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.6)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence—"grazing along my hearing," "echoes gathered like shy animals," "a click fluttered out, like a bird that had learned to imitate chains"—without a taught pattern or closure payoff, applying the density overwriting penalty (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear: "store wonder in the cellar of reason" is repeated nearly verbatim across paragraphs 4, 29, and 34, and "peripherally focused" recurs in paragraphs 7 and 21 without added pressure (−0.4 for loops). Mixed metaphor: "the season itself had limped in, leaking weather" mixes injury and fluid without coherent vehicle logic (−0.4 for coherence). Template cadence runs: "I came… I chalked… I filed… I set… I noted… I remembered… I went…" stack first-person declaratives across eight paragraphs without variation (−0.5). Cumulative artifact total: −1.9 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Sentence rhythm is uniform; no propulsive variation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative density is high throughout—most sentences carry metaphor or lyric compression—without teaching a pattern that pays off at closure. "Boundary-lessly trapped" and "orienting properly" recur as conceptual anchors but loop without progression; "shingled hush" appears in varied phrasings but does not escalate. Syntax varies, and rhythm supports the meditative pace, but information density is uneven: the widow, boy, and boat are summarized rather than dramatized. No severe loops or template cadence, but the closure beat leans on abstract declaration ("freedom here is a circle") where a concrete image would sharpen propulsion. Minor overwriting in peak beats; otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("sugar that time turned to ridged crystals, wintered into itself"). Information density is high: most lines do double work (craft action + emotional charge). Two loop issues lower the score: "here and gone" appears in seven lines, crossing from motif into churn; "hauntingly practical" used twice in identical phrasing feels like a safety anchor rather than voice necessity. The kettle's "thin animal nosing the air" and tea "like tigers pacing in fog" are vivid, but the animal metaphor stack in adjacent beats risks decorative density.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    Figurative density is high but mostly controlled: "song stripped to bones," "gear teeth on her tongue," "eyes arranged in a sequence that does not match any clock." Two adjacent lines paraphrase without added pressure: "She says the rhythm did not erase them; it sculpted them…that is a different kind of failure" restates the same idea. Template-stem check passes. One metaphor ("stillness fractures") contradicts the established stillness-as-held-breath frame at the close, though the effect may be intentional propulsion. Information density is strong; no loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high, and the prose advances character and atmosphere beat by beat. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "She reroutes the panels to a pump, and the pump to a cistern" echoes prior phrasing, and several "She [verb]" stems cluster in the middle third. Figurative language is dense and sometimes strained ("fountain shaped like a cosmic mouth," "water and confetti stars, sweet and improbable") without always clarifying the image. One minor clarity slip: "the sextant arc" in the penultimate section assumes the reader remembers its shape.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in closure beats ("the sanctuary accepted my offering the way snow accepts the shape of a sleeping fox"). Minor overwriting: figurative language appears densely in several paragraphs ("thin bell of thought," "mathematics of mercy," "architecture of letting something be itself"), occasionally stacking metaphors without full integration. A paraphrase-loop near mid-story ("silence was not emptiness... a river slowed to ice, a glacial hush that still moved") restates the concept. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, so non-closure cap applies. Grammar and mechanics are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance image and stake. Rhythm modulates from opening hush to the siren's "blast cut the day clean." No paraphrase loops. However, some figurative language stacks without clear payoff: "witnesses exhaled from every plank and rivet" and "listening threaded by balconies" blur slightly under their own ornamentation. Template stems appear: "By the silence" opens twice, "I said/He said" punctuate dialogue without variation. The final line's "weather front, steady and inescapable" delivers propulsion, but three mid-story beats could trim one modifier each for tighter momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths modulate with pressure. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or knowledge. Minor overwriting in the middle third: "wind through reed beds at low tide," "articulate syllables of salt and tension," and "memory to touch, and a grammar appears" cluster figurative language without strict causal need. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity remains intact. The final lines ("rope lies lighter, harbor still listening") propel without padding. Solid execution with a few decorative beats that do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; openings shift. Information density is high in many beats ("Salt fog beads on tin, knives breathe iron"). However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: "lonesome splendor" appears twice with similar vehicles; "geography of healing" recurs without fresh charge. Figurative density is heavy throughout without taught pattern—"gulls sound like hinges," "leaves scissor down," "laugh nobody else hears"—approaching overwriting in mid-pressure beats. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the accumulation of metaphor without escalation triggers a modest deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high ("Its weight tilted my palm toward the abyss, as if the future tugged the wrist like a patient teacher"), and many lines do multiple jobs. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Deductions: paraphrase loop in "I told it how the first engines rose… I told it how every blossom afterward carried a gear… I told it how" (three consecutive stems; −0.5). Mixed metaphor: "the song of oil has harmonies that gnaw, and in the gnawing I heard the crackle of our origin" conflates auditory registers without clear vehicle logic (−0.3). Stock metaphor: "chains creaked a lullaby" is serviceable but not fresh. No loops touch closure, so caps are not triggered, but cumulative line-level debt prevents high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied; lyric parallelism ("gracefully alert," "unyielding compassion," "kelp-drift peace") recurs purposefully to anchor motifs. Clarity holds across complex actions (scoring cleft, aligning cambium, binding with thread). Two friction points: "deceiving no one, expecting nothing but attention" is a strained metaphor whose vehicle (the lagoon as deceiver/expecter) contradicts established tranquility; "migration of clouds" appears in opening and closing but its symbolic function (time-passage, transience) is asserted rather than integrated into a choice. Information density is high—most lines advance ritual, relationship, or image—but runs of abstract nouns ("ballast, memory, and polish"; "harm," "chorus," "forgiveness") in the middle third lean toward tell over embodied perception. No loops or scaffold detected; minor overwriting in figurative density does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "tiny triangles winked from gutters and stairs, blue, then green, then a shard the color of sunset blood" advances plot, setting, and sensory texture). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the opening third: "light matters more than water, because water no longer moves" borders on abstract thesis rather than dramatized perception, and the "luminous skeptic" frame is stated rather than discovered. The constellation-key sequence and final wrapping remain clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high and often luminous ("her expression fractures into rain and then reforms"), but the accretion can dull momentum: nearly every sentence metaphorizes, and some vehicles contradict (petals fall "like snow but never touch ground at once" vs. "soft applause across the quiet sigh of falling petals"—unclear if they land or not). Paraphrase loop: "approximates infinity" appears twice in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence in paragraph structure (many begin with setting description). Information density is strong, but rhythm flatlines under the weight of consistent elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density; nearly every line advances character, setting, or the ribbon/stone relationship. Rhythm modulates well: longer contemplative sentences compress into shorter beats at peak moments ("I obeyed"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor overwriting in the opening third: "fiercely meditative, the kind who listens before any chisel dares to speak" and "sorrow grows where life insists on staying" edge toward purple without obscuring meaning. Figurative density is high but purposeful and consistent with the lyric mode taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines advance ritual, memory, or decision. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is controlled (pendulum as heart/moon, ridge as cut/mirror). Minor template cadence appears in the middle third: "I [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems repeat across six lines without escalation. One paraphrase loop: "To restore shared balance" (line 26) closely echoes the opening stake. No artifacts touch the closure beat, so penalties remain light.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and often dense ("a coil of thread, and a torn scrap of tapestry border"), but several beats carry paraphrase loops: the opening establishes "tenderly organized" in line 2, then restates it with "minute, choirboy precision"; the penultimate paragraph recycles "tenderly organized breaths" and "checking names, touching cracks, squaring offerings" without adding pressure. Filter-verb reliance is moderate but noticeable ("He believed moss would hold better," "He read direction"). Template-cadence runs appear mid-story: "He set… He pressed… He returned… He walked" across consecutive beats. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for filter-verb stacks in reflective beats, total −0.9, keeping the score in mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose has a lyric texture ("the spire thrummed as if the basalt had nerves," "kelp," "inlet"), but density is uneven: multiple sentences restate the trellis-versus-wall metaphor without advancing pressure ("Let the prediction be a trellis... prune, but leave shoots; train the vine, but let it find sunlight" followed by "offer scenarios built to bend, framed by rations... but spacious enough for ingenuity"). Paraphrase loops and synonym churn cluster around the core metaphor (trellis, lattice, garden, vine, openings) without fresh causal work. Filter-verb stacks ("I told them," "I said," "I breathed, sensing") dull immediacy in peak beats. Figurative language is dense but occasionally mixed or strained ("hollow reed" chamber, "basalt had nerves," "kelp" braid in quick succession). The final paragraph edges into scaffolding ("Only then did the lesson... settle in me") rather than letting the image speak. Clarity remains high; no major grammar or sequencing errors. Information density is moderate but repetition lowers propulsion in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths modulate with pressure. Information density is high: "She collected ash from the stove, chalk from broken rehearsal slates, and mildew-soft paper, stirring a gullible powder that remembered fingertips" does triple duty (action, world-building, metaphor). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor artifacts: "The boy turned, the boat slid, and the outlines held" uses comma-splice rhythm that recurs in a few other beats, creating slight monotony. "Secretly luminous" appears twice in identical phrasing (first and late), which feels like a deliberate callback but could vary slightly for texture. One filter-verb cluster in the middle third ("she recognized," "she marked," "she cut") slightly dulls immediacy but does not touch closure. Overall propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high: most lines advance ritual, character, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("the mirage of safety looks most real when we are thirstiest," "the gallery holds its breath") charges key beats without muddle. Minor issues: "I hear what they omit and shade what they fear, and the rest emerges as if the paper remembers for them" leans slightly abstract; "the sad light" and "soft room scrape against the bones of memory" edge toward stock phrasing. A brief paraphrase loop: "I tell them I can hold their storm long enough to crystallize a fleeting emotion, and then let it go" restates the narrator's method without added pressure. No major loops or template cadence, and the final image ("the mask catches the light, its shards holding tiny sunsets, and the ash makes a weather all its own") is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with high information load per sentence: "Each morning the canal scabs over with oil, and the sun scrapes it into an abrasive calm" layers image, action, and tone without redundancy. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths shift with beats (short declaratives at decision points, longer accumulative blocks during salvage). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is consistent and functional ("water keeps its grip like a patient warden," "time…bites back," "rust into legend") without register drift or mixed metaphors. Minor density slip: "They both want what I found yesterday" could integrate exposition more tightly, and "Some came with suspicion, some with oars" reads slightly generic. Final line ("until the clocks stop or the children stop asking why") charges closure without overwriting. Grammar and pronoun references are clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense in many lines ("the library inhaled the cold and turned it warm"). However, several beats suffer from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "She had called it...She would smile and say..."; "I said...I asked...I said...I rotated...I said" runs cluster filter verbs and identical stems across adjacent sentences. Mixed metaphor: "thread cast across unlearning hatred like a bridge you cannot see until you step" conflates thread, bridge, and stepping without coherent vehicle logic. Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5 for density, −0.4 for mixed metaphor, −0.4 for template cadence = cumulative −1.3 range, plus minor paraphrase loop −0.2). Artifacts touch multiple beats but not the closure image itself, so cap at −1.5 total per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is very high, with metaphor in nearly every sentence: "hinges cried like old gulls," "sky made room for prophecy," "roots tasted the air," "arranging is how I will refuse." Most images are fresh and voice-coherent, but the accumulation slows momentum in non-peak beats (the pruning sequence runs long with "inviting moonwind" and "grief that had run on for years"). Two paraphrase loops: the "gentle rebellion" concept is restated across three beats without added pressure, and the synaptic plasticity explanation appears twice (once mid-story, once near the end). Template cadence is avoided, and sentence openings vary. No grammar errors. The closure beat ("laid the bowls in a circle, a ritual of ordinary care") is clean and propulsive, so non-closure density caps accumulation penalty at −0.8, preventing entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create texture. Information density is high: most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. The phosphorus-glow sequence is concise and propulsive. Minor issues: "I asked for toll not in coins but in reason, because reason was scarce and I was hired to gather it" and "Also, I collect wonder as toll, and lies never pay enough" are near-paraphrases of the same thematic claim; a template-cadence check flags "I cannot, I told her" / "I reached beneath my bench" / "I slid a match" / "I watched the sky" clustering in mid-passage. These accumulate to −0.6 in Q7. No loops touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. However, several lines loop conceptually: "not absence but a presence that crouches" is restated as "the heavier half of quiet," and "houses are conversations that keep going" is echoed in "every displaced cup is a raised hand." Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching or payoff that tightens pressure. "Inadvertently profound" in the tides line reads as self-label rather than earned insight. Clarity remains high, but momentum occasionally stalls under decorative phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies (short declaratives, longer accumulative runs), and figurative language is dense but largely coherent. However, near-paraphrase loops appear: "I threaded my message along the cracks...tugging it through fallen rooms" restates the same action; "We sent that thought outward, threading it along sluices" repeats the threading motif without added pressure. Overwriting is present in high-pressure beats ("revelations cascaded then, not as blows but as rain" followed immediately by "I became a conduit, animate lifeless no longer a contradiction but a method"). Stock constructions like "remember/remembered" recur across a dozen lines, creating template cadence. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence; the artifacts do not touch the closure beat directly but accumulate enough to lower momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with no paraphrase loops; every sentence advances proof, texture, or memory. Sentence openings vary purposefully, and rhythm accelerates through the rupture beat then decelerates into the theorem's acceptance. Minor deduction: two adjacent lines in the mid-section ("I say her name once" / "The staircase accepts my induction") feel slightly scaffolded, approaching template cadence without crossing into full loop. Figurative language (dice as metronome, staircase as listener) is consistent and voice-motivated, never muddy. The final paragraph's parallelism ("proof in my chest, texture under my tongue") charges closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, with shorter beats during visitor exchanges and longer accumulative sentences for Anya's reflection. Two frictions lower the score: (1) paraphrase loop in the opening ("She was methodically hopeful" followed immediately by the ledger sentence that restates the same trait without added pressure); (2) figurative density in the first third—multiple moon/light metaphors cluster without beat involvement. The final third tightens cleanly. No coherence breaks, but the metaphoric stack in the opening triggers −0.5 under the Overwriting Check.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence-level propulsion is strong—"We proofed the past with steam and flour" and "water to letters again" compress multiple jobs per line. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "green coins," "honey smoke," "silver curtain" for the waterfall. One mixed metaphor: "dread drifted like a scent we wore to feel less alone" conflates drift/wear/company in ways that blur the vehicle. The opening line anchors voice and stakes; the closing image ("memory could bow without apology") recharges theater/stage motifs. No paraphrase loops; information density high. Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph 2 ("I kept," "I held," "I taught") does not dull immediacy given the curatorial voice.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high, with most lines advancing mechanism, image, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the reversal and breathing in the final vigil. However, template cadence appears in repeated "I [verb]" stems across the mechanism assembly sequence, and several metaphors stack without always clarifying ("light withdrew, a latent radiance succumbing to order" near-duplicates the concept). Minor paraphrase loops occur ("bleak exhilaration" recurs without added pressure mid-text). The closure image is clear, but prior beats carry slight scaffold weight that dulls momentum incrementally.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences propel with varied rhythm and high information density ("After the resuscitation, my lungs still tasted of river coins, and the paramedic's hands echoed in my ribs"). Figurative language is dense but purposeful and coherent across most beats: "patient glow," "humid breath," "tucked animal." Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor overwriting in one stretch: "graceful as mildew," "mannequin mouth flexed by wires," and "greedy memory" cluster without pattern-teaching, applying slight density drag (−0.3). No loops, scaffold, or filter stacks. Grammar and tense are stable. Paragraph structure varies purposefully, accelerating through the booth sequence and breathing in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("orchard floated on a circle of driftwood," "wave remembered another shape"). Minor issues: template cadence in mid-paragraphs ("He listened… He set… He began…") and paraphrase loops ("a pulse that kept his nerves awake" / "a bassline, restless and sure") that do not quite obscure causality but accumulate to −0.6. Information density is strong; no major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("spiral-shell cartographer," "notes break into motifs"). Information density is high: most lines advance world, character, or atmosphere. However, repetitive stems cluster in the middle third: "I ask...I ask...I read...I blow...I touch...I thank...I turn...I carry" stacks first-person declaratives across seven lines without syntactic variety, triggering −0.4 for template cadence. The phrase "pattern languages" recurs eight times, risking synonym churn, though it functions as a taught motif. No paraphrase loops at closure; the final image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is ambitious and image-rich ("ivy breathes a green hush," "her throat heat, then cools it with numbers"), with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. However, the piece suffers from figurative density that occasionally muddles clarity: "the pit of lies sighs like a mouth finally uncorked" mixes metaphors (sighs/uncorked), and "fictional historian" is both role and concept without embodied grounding. Repetitive phrasing appears in adjacent lines—"they call it the pit of lies, and only the ivy knows the names it keeps" echoes "the pit of lies" from two sentences prior without adding pressure. The final third stacks exposition ("She explains that a fictional historian crafts truths that breathe, and then tags her method in the margin") that reads as scaffolding for the prompt rather than scene pressure. Filter verbs ("watches with worry," "feels her throat heat") cluster in mid-pressure beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: most lines advance setting, interiority, or thematic image without slack. Figurative language threads consistently (water as reader, algae as pennants, notes as heartbeat) with coherent vehicles that land the pavilion's dual presence/absence. Paraphrase loops appear: "I come not only to measure but to become the archeologist" then "measure is a kind of praise" recycles the claim; "interlaced absence" repeats across three paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence surfaces in parallel "I + verb" openings and "After the drawbridge rises" bookends, yet the pattern reads voice-motivated rather than artifactual. Minor filter-verb stack ("seemed to float," "thought," "try to guide") in mid-passage slightly dulls immediacy. No syntax monotony; rhythm modulates appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: nearly every line advances pressure (stamp mechanics, crescent test, family history, hypothesis tree). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; openings avoid template stems. Minimal scaffold or loops. One brief cluster: "I readjusted the indexed order" echoes "readjust my habits" and "alternative hypothesis" recurs, but each instance advances knowledge without paraphrase. Figurative language is controlled ("algae stars," "tide flex of the dome") and consistent with narrator's technical-poetic register. Proofreading clean; action sequence clear.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and purposeful; sentence openings vary. Information density is high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or the grief motif. The prose is vivid and compressed ("I rake steam from the shrubs," "my fingers are thin maps"). However, the middle third contains paraphrase loops and template cadence: multiple paragraphs begin with "I [verb]" or "The lanterns/cranes [verb]," and several beats restate the gem-polishing and dream-recording process without added pressure. The phrase "Ever since Lio fell through the sky seam, my shadow went after him" is striking, but the surrounding lines ("I wake without silhouette and dress in ache") recycle near-synonyms for grief across adjacent sentences. These artifacts accumulate to −0.6 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully—short beats ("The Hunt begins again") alternate with longer lyric lines ("Those fields feel Intangibly tangible, like heat seen on the road"). Information density is high: most sentences layer image, memory, and present action without redundancy. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "dragonflies trapped in bottles," "waterline is my breath right now," "maps fade like phosphors after a kiss." Two frictions: "perturbation theory, we whisper disturbances into the equations" risks technical opacity for non-specialist readers, and the sequence "tilt, gimbals breathe, decks hum" compresses three actions into one breath without clear causal order—both momentarily slow momentum but recover quickly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The final lines propel without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: many lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the chip shivers as if remembering hands and furnaces, and the pilgrim murmurs vowels without consonants" layers object-state, memory, and action). Minor loop: "brilliant dimness" recurs verbatim in lines 1 and 12 without tonal shift or added pressure (−0.2). Some metaphors cluster densely in the opening and middle third ("sky had been pleased and returned its tools," "letters into directions home") but remain coherent and support the lyric lens. No template cadence, filter stacks, or register drift. Clarity and propulsion are sustained through the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the watch hand found me as if the sea remembered my ledger" advances plot, atmosphere, and guilt). Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful. Minor deductions: a few near-paraphrase loops ("I told a fisherman his daughter had drowned" / "The daughter lived, traded like an heirloom") and some elevated metaphor density in expository beats ("a forest of futures," "proofread himself out of a family") that slightly slow momentum. No loops or artifacts touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (most lines layer image, action, and stake). The opening and closing lines charge the frame. Deductions: the antique drawer pull is described identically three times ("antique drawer pull" verbatim), constituting a light paraphrase loop; "between apology and forgiveness" appears four times without fresh pressure in later uses; a few runs share stem structure ("I ask," "I tell," "I note"). Artifacts are non-closure and do not obscure causality, so Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 for loops and stems, routed here only.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("wind buttered the water," "kayak took the water like a letter sliding into an addressed envelope," "gulls stitched errant commas"). Two mixed metaphors strain clarity: "faith sputter under the weight of rehearsed patience" conflates fire and physical load; "regrets, snapping back harder than the original wave" mixes physics metaphors without grounding. Template cadence appears in the mother's teaching and the naming ritual (parallel stems). Paraphrase loop: "I had told my sister a hundred softened versions, but the pure one was this" followed immediately by the barge incident recap. Information density is otherwise strong. No clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("stubborn constellations," "wire core," "hollow-eyed and steady, the lake's veteran, a sentinel of hush"), risking overwriting in a lyric mode. Most metaphors cohere, but "jaded wonder climbing my throat like smoke that forgot whether to warn or warm" strains vehicle logic. Several adjacent lines paraphrase: "After the procedure" appears twice in opening paragraphs; "delicately robust" recurs four times. Read-aloud rhythm varies well, but the elevated register occasionally drifts from the protagonist's stated dirty past. Information density is generally strong (lines do multiple jobs), yet the abundance of figurative language in peak beats (confession, vial-release) approaches −0.5 overwriting threshold without crossing it.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high ("petals glistening like small moons," "clove sparks braid my hair with smoke," "kiss like comets") and mostly coherent, but the conjuration beats stack metaphors in nearly every line without pattern-teaching, risking overwriting. Paraphrase loop: "You are different, yes, but also you, my love" and "You say, Hear me by being me" restate proximity without added pressure. Template cadence: "I smell…I open…I breathe…I press" across adjacent paragraphs. Clarity holds, but momentum drags slightly under decorative weight; the final third tightens. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully in the transformation and reunion beats.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high and momentum mostly sustained, but figurative language crowds several high-pressure beats: "outline becomes a doorway," "cards fall into it like birds," "path like a throat," "ravine of quiet chimes, patient as pennies" appear in rapid succession without anchoring causal links. Two adjacent lines paraphrase the theme of repentance and recovery ("go fetch what can be gathered back, and repent in the only direction left" followed by brooch and cloth actions) without added pressure. Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports the ritual, but clarity dips slightly when metaphors layer thickly. Minor positives: no loops, strong closing cadence, grammar clean.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: most lines layer action, setting, and emotional charge (e.g., "I pricked my thumb on a bent suture needle and let one drop fall, then began to stitch a seam of light"). Rhythm varies and propulsion is clear. Two friction points: "We built the vessel from broken stations and funerary scaffolds, then seeded it with archives, soil, and a midwife who delivered the only sleeper before dying" compresses backstory efficiently but slightly stalls momentum in the opening third. Figurative language is dense (most sentences carry metaphor) but remains coherent and pattern-taught, avoiding the density penalty since the lyric mode is established early and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and many lines do multiple jobs ("The hush whispered like pages, telling her that if fire has many mouths, water has many doors"). However, figurative density is high throughout peak beats without clear pattern-teaching—"velvet hem," "portable constellations," "slippered like wet sand," "transformation wore velvet"—and some vehicles ("sea would mistake them for a patient constellation") stretch coherence. Minor paraphrase loop: "whispering hush" and "vibrant hush" recur without distinct functional shifts. Stock metaphor: "seeding kind accidents…like wildflowers after rain." These accumulate to −0.6 in Q7. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentence openings show range. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character stance, or world logic. Clarity holds across the archive descent and wheel activation. However, figurative language clusters densely in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without clear escalation pattern: "the dark blink me past," "breath that starts a confession," "wheel shuddered, then remembered the verb for turning." This density approaches overwriting in the climax, risking decorative weight. Minor template cadence: "I knelt, pressed… room exhaled… cradle waited… companions arrived" stacks similar participial stems. A paraphrase loop appears: "The intrigue was never to topple thrones with shouts, but to reveal that doors knew how to open. We moved during an unexplained blackout, and what we opened was permission"—the second sentence restates the first without added pressure. Proofreading is clean, and the opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs effectively, but mid-scene loops and ornamental metaphor prevent higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully ("It is the hour after friction disappears" / "The eels feel it first, threading the sequences like dark needles"), and information density is high (most lines advance ritual, world rules, or stakes). However, paraphrase loops appear: "I am the elusive eel herder" recurs across paragraphs without added pressure, and "the promise" is restated multiple times in adjacent lines ("I promised to return" / "the promise hung" / "To carry it I whisper the promise again"). Figurative density occasionally clouds clarity: "ride the slope as if steering a thought" and "hidden by the math we asked the sea to speak" both blur vehicle and tenor in peak beats. Template stems cluster in the middle third ("I scoop… I whisper… I feel…"), mildly flattening propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high, but figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without taught pattern: "clouds began, and the world seemed to rarefy," "bright with electric threads," "loops and slashes mapping a geography of refusal." Mixed metaphors: "thunder rose and fell as if the mountain were breathing" later becomes "thunder breathed in"—coherent but dense. Template cadence in the Mara dialogue sequence ("She introduced… she said… she added… she laid") and paraphrase loops ("rarefy" used twice in close proximity) reduce propulsion. Apply −0.6 for density + template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify. Figurative density is high throughout ("hands folded like questions that expect applause," "path forward is hidden like music under a cough") and occasionally muddles in stacked vehicles. Some lines do double duty (the brook as timekeeper and directional metaphor) but others loop conceptually: "turn questions into destinations" repeats across three beats without added pressure. No major template cadence or filter stacks. Clarity holds at closure. Information density is moderate; a few scaffolding phrases ("deciding where to stand, where to interrupt") could compress further.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high ("coffee tin with secret false bottom," "vines will scribe green cursive"), but several beats recycle template cadences: "We braid… we tuck… we stack… we read… we open… we buy… we post." This stem repetition across seven sentences in the final third creates a paraphrase loop that dulls propulsion (−0.6). Mixed metaphor appears in "a shipwreck of pages and iron" (shipwrecks don't typically involve iron in that fusion), and "the sky is a listening room" strains coherence (−0.3). The final line "our rebuilt rumor finally names itself library" is strong, but the accumulated pattern artifacts and filter-verb stacks ("We move… Mara carries… I carry") in high-pressure beats lower the grade.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and often propulsive ("I slipped the reel over the projector's old jaw, and the ceiling unscrolled into a tidal arbor above the clouds"), with strong sensory specificity and minimal filter verbs. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "I play until the horizon invites night" recurs verbatim, and adjacent sentences in the arbor sequence restate the music's emergence without added detail. Template cadence: multiple mid-story paragraphs open with "I [verb]" in close succession, creating a drumbeat. Figurative language is dense (crazed glass dome, centipede leader, moths, trapped lark) and occasionally mixed (surf as arbor, then surf learning to speak in cinders). These patterns accumulate to −0.6 to −0.8 within Q7, preventing entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high, with many lines doing double duty (e.g., "The seed drinks this unity, darkens, and splits; a threadling root tastes stone and decides"). Figurative language is thick throughout—most sentences carry metaphor or elevated diction—without a taught pattern that pays off at closure, triggering a density penalty. Paraphrase loops appear: "I do not promise certainty, only luminous doubt" echoes the final paragraph's "Doubt is not removed; it is clarified." Template cadence in the dream-harvesting section ("The first dream… The second dream… The third…") is functional but mechanical. No grammar or tense errors. Loops and figurative density lower the score by ~0.8 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high and rhythm modulates well (short declaratives in the pool scene accelerate pressure). However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without clear pattern payoff ("sorrow is tuned correctly," "compass … shut its mouth like a clam," "blade's restraint," "blue … like a mood, not steam but memory"). Mixed metaphor: the pool glows "like a lighthouse … buried in it by grief and told to whisper" stacks vehicles incoherently. Template cadence in the middle third ("It told…," "And beneath…," "The notes said…") and paraphrase loops ("rhythmically placid" appears three times across the text) trigger −0.6. No major clarity breaks, but the density without white space risks fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level writing is dense and musical, with many sentences doing double or triple duty (advancing action, revealing character, and carrying theme) and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphor is frequent but controlled and coherent—slope vs. cliff, spin-down, dust as constellations, decay as arithmetic—and it rarely muddies literal sense. There is a slight risk of saturation, as nearly every line reaches for an image, but rhythm and clarity largely hold, particularly around the closure beats. Syntax and punctuation are clean, with good variation in sentence length and paragraphing that supports momentum rather than stalling it.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are precise, varied, and information-dense, with metaphorical language that largely remains coherent and purposeful (“frost is a quiet cartographer,” “heat traded for meaning”). There is minimal scaffold or redundancy; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or thematic patterning. Figurative density is high but controlled; images echo one another instead of spiraling into mixed metaphors, and the final paragraphs land cleanly. The piece borders on lush, but it avoids purple prose by maintaining clarity and narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is tightly controlled despite its high figurative density; images are precise, non-redundant, and multi-functional (world rule, emotion, and theme at once). Sentence rhythms vary cleanly, avoiding template cadences or paraphrase loops, and almost every line does more than one job. Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned with water, glass, frost, and breath, with no mixed or strained vehicles that blur sense. The final paragraphs in particular exhibit high information density and rhythmic control without any muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Line-level craft is superb: nearly every sentence does double duty, advancing image and theme with minimal redundancy. Figurative density is high but controlled; metaphors extend a consistent vocabulary of sea, libraries, and addresses without muddle or mixed vehicles. Rhythm varies naturally, and the closure image (“a softer eye that sees where cries go when they stop needing to be heard”) is both lucid and reconfiguring. I see no obvious scaffold, loops, or syntactic artifacts dulling momentum, even in the reflective turns.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush, dense, and generally disciplined: most sentences carry multiple jobs—world, mood, and theme—without obvious scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythm on the page is varied and musical. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and well-rooted in the story’s motifs (sound, tide/harbor, hunger, light in metal), and there are few if any mixed metaphors that break sense. A couple of lines flirt with overstatement or abstraction (“the city answered with amplified quiet… where fear and resolve share the same low frequency”), leaning more toward essayistic than embodied, which slightly dulls immediacy. Still, line-level control is strong enough to sustain momentum and clarity through to the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, often doing double duty for image and concept, and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundancy. The figurative language is mostly fresh and coherent, and the prose propels the scene despite its meditative pacing. That said, metaphor density is very high—almost every sentence carries a simile or image—which risks saturation and occasional blur, especially in the later thematic clarifications. A bit more restraint or contrast would sharpen the already impressive effect.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without redundancy. Images are fresh yet legible (“wind unfurled from the center like a held breath let go”; “birds…their calls echoed like ink dropped into water”) and metaphors remain internally consistent with the organic/time motif. There is no noticeable scaffold, synonym churn, or template cadence; rhythm varies gracefully and supports momentum despite the contemplative mode. The closing lines, in particular, achieve high information density and resonance without slipping into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level work is remarkably clean: varied syntax, high information density, and images that carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors are coherent and do not blur sense or stall momentum. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding sentences, and each paragraph adds new pressure or texture. If anything, the prose occasionally risks lushness, but it remains lucid and propulsive through the climax and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense and imagistic, but most metaphors are coherent, specific, and multi-functional (e.g., “warnings are how living ears survive” bridges biology, craft, and emotional defense). Sentences carry high information density, often advancing worldbuilding, theme, and character simultaneously, with little true scaffolding or repetition. Rhythm varies well between long, rolling lyric lines and tighter, more pointed beats around key actions (burning the oilskin, the father’s explanation). Despite the lushness, clarity of action and emotional stakes holds; there is no figurative muddle that obscures the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is lush and mostly precise, with many sentences doing triple duty for image, mood, and thematic charge (“moonbeams pooled around his laces, like minnows testing a river mouth”). Rhythm varies nicely, and there is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each line tends to move the piece. The figurative density is very high—nearly every sentence bears a metaphor—which occasionally risks saturation, though coherence and clarity remain intact. Trimming one or two of the more decorative comparisons in the middle stretch could sharpen impact without harming the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is notably strong: most sentences do double or triple duty—advancing setting, character, and theme—and there is minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and controlled (e.g., “a bubbled bell…a small roof for fragile talk”), and the repetition patterns around fire, breath, and thaw feel deliberate rather than looped. Syntax and paragraphing create a persuasive rhythm that mirrors the work’s meditative focus without stalling momentum. A few constructions tip toward the ornate (“a weighty lightness that is almost music”), but they don’t obscure sense or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is dense but generally precise, with most metaphors coherent and tasking multiple jobs (e.g., “pages flaking like scabs” marrying setting to bodily injury and theme). Syntax varies and momentum rarely stalls; even reflective sentences tend to advance either world logic or emotional stakes. There are a few moments that flirt with over-stacking abstractions (“transformative betrayal,” “replace your hinges and demand you swing”), but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure image. No noticeable loops or scaffolding repetitions undercut the prose, particularly in the climactic library sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush yet mostly efficient: many sentences do double or triple duty in image, theme, and atmosphere (“Wind paced the battlements like a tired animal that knew the path and had to keep walking”). Metaphor chains remain coherent within the sea/stone/silence palette, and there is little to no paraphrase looping or scaffolding. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous, which occasionally risks saturation and slightly blurs a few beats that might want sharper edges. Trimming one or two metaphor-heavy lines around the core turns would heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is tight, with high information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and disciplined, rarely mixing metaphors or drifting off the established register; images like “lint caught between machines and intentions” or “steam writes cursive” are both clear and fresh. Repetition supports structure and mood rather than feeling like synonym churn or scaffold, and there are no evident artifacts that obscure causality or closure. Rhythm varies nicely, with longer, meditative lines counterpointed by sharper turns at key beats (bowing the violin, the crack, the puddle-comma).

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is lush and information-dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (advancing mood, theme, and plot simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent within a unified palette of rain, light, sound, and paper; it rarely tips into muddle. There is minimal redundancy and good rhythmic variation between longer, sinuous lines and shorter, declarative ones, keeping momentum. A very demanding editor might trim a few metaphors, but they do not materially obscure causality or dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: images are precise (“tablets blinking like cold ponds”; “breadcrumbs that know how to wait”) and multi-purpose. Figurative language is frequent but not muddy; metaphors are coherent and thematically linked to luck, gardening, and light. Sentences carry high information density with minimal redundancy, and the prose flows without scaffold or template cadence. The closing sentence cleanly recharges earlier motifs of mutual recognition and care.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and usually do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with coherent metaphoric fields (ice, mechanics, birds, light, time) rather than grab-bag ornament. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops; nearly every line advances either the science-as-poetry conceit or the ethical tension. The only minor check is that the density of imagery is almost uniformly high, leaving little room for a sharper rhythmic spike at the story’s emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and rhythm varies effectively. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with metaphors that align with the world (music, water, breath, wood) and rarely feel strained; “lanterns shook in the draft, their light a trembling score” is emblematic. There are no meaningful redundancy loops or clunky explanatory sentences, and the closure image (“the moon replaced them by sneaking through the broken cornice”) lands cleanly. At the margins, a few phrases echo (“in between spaces”) but they function as motif rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: images like “it learned forecasting the way pain learns patience” or “a feather against the storm” do double thematic and emotional work. Figurative language is frequent yet unified around weather, instruments, bodies, and margins, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple overload. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and nearly every line advances character, setting, or stakes; there’s little to no scaffold or repetition. The closure paragraph is especially clean and potent, with concrete actions (speaking, taping, penciling) grounding the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but mostly efficient: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept, and images tend to pull double duty (“memory had teeth” both literalizes the beads and sharpens the emotional bite). Figurative language is frequent, yet metaphors remain coherent and thematically aligned with machinery, religion, and grease; there’s little true ornament. Rhythm varies well across the piece, and syntax stays clear even in complex sentences, preserving momentum through the discovery sequence. A slight tendency toward uniform lushness keeps it shy of absolute top-band minimalism, but clarity and propulsion never significantly suffer.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are precise and multi-functional, usually advancing atmosphere, theme, and character at once, and metaphors are fresh and coherent across the piece. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line earns its place, and the final paragraphs in particular have excellent cadence. The prose edges toward over-density—almost every sentence is metaphorically loaded—which risks slight saturation and softens the impact of individual images. Nonetheless, clarity remains high and closure is undulled, so the ornamental excess is a minor, not structural, issue.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, with very little scaffold or redundancy. Metaphors (“ordinary magic rides on quiet details,” “the bowl answered with a bell so round it seemed to bow”) are fresh and coherent, and they rarely stack in ways that blur meaning. The rhythm supports the accumulative pressure of the ritual, and the final paragraph lands with precision. A pervasive lyricism slightly risks uniformity of texture, but it does not materially slow momentum or obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is lush but mostly precise: metaphors are coherent, varied, and usually do more than one job (world-building, theme, and mood in a single image). There is a high density of figurative language, yet syntax and rhythm remain legible and propulsive, with almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops. A few lines edge toward over-saturation (“a shifting map of how the axis had moved human attention away from night”) and risk conceptual blur. Overall, however, clarity survives the lyric density, and the final sentences land cleanly and musically.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are precise, and most metaphors do double duty for character, world, and theme without stacking into muddle. There’s high figurative density, but the pattern is taught early and sustained with control; phrases like “thermos of tea, and a stapled booklet titled spycraft microdot film specs” balance lyricism with grounded specificity. I see no paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. The closing paragraphs in particular are tight, with clean propulsion into the final sea-and-melody image.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but highly controlled: metaphors (“bruise agreeing with a staircase,” “questions are a commons”) are surprising yet coherent, and most sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, theme). Rhythm varies effectively between longer lyric lines and clipped questions, matching shifts in pressure. There is little scaffolding or paraphrase-looping; repetition (“hush,” “Let there be…”) is patterned and functional rather than accidental. On a very demanding editorial standard, a couple of metaphors flirt with overrichness, but they do not obscure causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and images that usually carry multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) at once, e.g. “The lake answers in hairline cracks, shy and precise.” There is pervasive figurative language, but it is mostly coherent and patterned rather than muddled; only occasionally does the density flirt with saturation. Sentences vary in rhythm and opening structure, and there’s little scaffold or paraphrase looping. The final image is clear and charged—no prose artifacts blunt the closure, though a demanding editor might trim one or two metaphors for breath.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are vivid and often do double duty for setting and theme, and there is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase. A few metaphors (“counting tiles, except the numbers were missing their middles”; “lamp…lost another beat, the darkening brightness turning thoughtful”) edge toward density, but they remain coherent and legible rather than purple. Momentum holds despite the lyricism; almost every sentence advances either pressure or reweights a motif. The main limit preventing an even higher score is that figurative language is quite frequent, occasionally risking saturation in the midsection without always adding new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double or triple duty (world, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and the rhythm varies in length and structure. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and internally consistent (e.g., “a timid bird warming its own egg,” “a courteous partner refusing to lead”). A few lines approach overt poetic flourish or thematic statement, yet they do not materially slow momentum or obscure cause/effect. The closure image is clear and charged, with no looping or syntactic muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere, character, and concept. Metaphor use is heavy but generally coherent and fresh (“carried rain like an oath,” “flown through difficult taste”), and rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. There is mild risk of overload, as figurative language saturates nearly every sentence, but it rarely obscures sense or cause/effect. I see no major loops or scaffolding; the prose could be fractionally leaner and still as powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and multi-functional, often advancing atmosphere, theme, and psychology at once (“memories were weights tied to scents, sometimes balloons, sometimes anchors”). Figurative language is frequent but carefully chosen and internally consistent with the crystal/light/scent lexicon; it rarely feels redundant or mixed. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every sentence earns its place in propulsion or deepening. The only restraint from a higher band is that the lyrical density is uniform even in higher-pressure moments, where a touch more rhythmic contraction might sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line by line, the prose is dense yet efficient; nearly every sentence advances image, character, or stakes without visible scaffold or repetition. Figurative language is abundant but patterned and coherent, building a unified metaphorical logic around sound, texture, and time rather than drifting into mixed or confusing images. Rhythm varies thoughtfully, with longer, flowing lines for exposition and shorter, weighted ones around key turns (“The second thins…”; “The whale keeps the pattern…”). There are no notable syntactic artifacts, redundancies, or clarity slips that blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level work is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, theme) without redundancy, and figurative language is fresh and coherent (“violin scratches out stars, then backs away to offer milk”). Rhythm varies gracefully between clipped beats and flowing clauses, matching shifts in pressure. Repetition (“chronic hush,” ship ribs, the bowl) is patterned and functional rather than looped scaffolding. There are no visible artifacts, mixed metaphors, or clarity slips, and the final lines land with clean, distilled cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is dense but largely efficient: most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and emotional charge, and metaphors are coherent and grounded in the story’s sensory obsessions (amber, static, scent). Rhythm varies, with some luxuriant periods balancing shorter, declarative lines at key turns (“Subsume nothing, I said; let us channel, not drown.”). There is some risk of overload—nearly every line carries imagery—but it doesn’t materially obscure action or closure. Minor trims could heighten impact, yet the current prose still reads as polished and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush but purposeful: most sentences do more than one job (advancing memory, building atmosphere, and sharpening theme simultaneously) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high, yet images rarely blur each other; metaphors (“gulls edit the sky,” “the sea making parentheses”) remain coherent and legible. There is a mild risk of saturation, but momentum holds and the closure image is crisp, not drowned in ornament. Mechanics are clean, and line-level rhythm supports the reflective, accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, concrete, and typically multi-functional, advancing atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is rich and inventive, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences. However, the density of metaphor and neologistic description is near-constant; in places it risks over-saturating the reader and slightly blurring crispness of individual beats. Because the lyrical pattern is taught early and maintained, this is more a mild excess than a structural problem, keeping the prose just shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (world, mood, character, or mechanics), and the figurative language is coherent and sensorial (“bubble made of memory,” “night spills its first ink”). The prose flirts with maximalism but avoids purple excess because images stay concrete and specific; rhythm varies enough to prevent monotony. I see no real scaffold or paraphrase loops, and action order remains clear even in the most lyric stretches. A touch more breathing room in one or two metaphor-heavy sentences could marginally improve clarity, but it doesn’t materially harm momentum as is.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (world-building, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffold or synonym churn. Figurative language is dense but disciplined; images extend a coherent vocabulary of mathematics, light, stone, and echo rather than spiraling into mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the closure image (chalk and salt fruit, “silence opens like a gate”) lands cleanly. A faint tendency toward over-articulation of insight in a few lines is the only detectable drag.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but remarkably precise; metaphors (“a voice scrapes loose like a match,” “reading tables wait, long oars”) are fresh and rarely feel overstacked. There is no noticeable scaffolding or synonym churn, and nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (setting, character, and theme simultaneously). Cadence modulates well, slowing for tactile movement in the pipe chase and tightening around the playback. A few phrases flirt with purple, but they stay legible and purposeful, not muddying causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense yet disciplined: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme, and figurative language is fresh and coherent (“a damp rib cage with the patience of a bellows,” “passengers with patience”). There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or muddled metaphors; line-level clarity holds even in more abstract moments. Rhythm shifts appropriately between long, lush sentences and shorter, declarative lines near the gale and the resolution, maintaining momentum. A slightly high saturation of imagery is still under tonal control and does not obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (world, character, mood) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are frequent but mostly disciplined and coherent with the water/industry palette, avoiding mixed vehicles or purple drift. There are no meaningful loops or template cadences; syntax and paragraphing vary to give the piece a pleasing ebb and flow that matches tide imagery. The density of figurative language approaches the upper limit but remains controlled enough not to obscure causality or the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, images are fresh, and most metaphors pull double-duty for mood and meaning (“the sound walks away from us like a child pretending to be tall”). There’s impressive information density without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and the final cadence lands cleanly. The main restraint on a higher score is occasional near-continuous figurative texture, which slightly flattens dynamic contrast and could, in a stricter venue, be pared for even sharper impact. Nonetheless, the prose remains clear and propulsive for this lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, few if any redundant sentences, and a generally excellent ear for rhythm and image. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically aligned; metaphors rarely feel mixed or sloppy. There is some risk of tonal and syntactic sameness, with many similarly weighted sentences, but momentum still carries through to the end. No obvious scaffolding, filter-verb stacks, or clarity issues mar the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and there are few if any scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is rich but largely coherent and thematically consistent (rails, maps, tickets, platforms), and rhythm adjusts well between movement and revelation. There is mild risk of over-saturation of metaphor in places, but it doesn’t materially blunt clarity or the closure beat. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final lines land with sharp, un-muddled images.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with many lines doing triple duty for setting, theme, and emotion, and the rhythms are controlled enough that the lyricism rarely muddies sense. Extended metaphoric sequences (unheard symphony, braided stars, bridges across forgetting) are coherent rather than mixed, and there’s little to no paraphrase scaffolding or filler sentences. The main constraint at this level is the sheer density of imagery—some readers may feel near-saturation, and a handful of lines could be pruned without loss—but clarity at closure is preserved. Grammar and sequencing are clean, with a strong read-aloud cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but highly controlled: most lines do double or triple duty in advancing mood, world, and stake without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent, with motifs (thunder, light, mutiny, braiding) interlocking rather than clashing. Rhythm varies well between longer, baroque sentences and cleaner declaratives, especially near the climax and exit. It skirts purple in a few spots, but never enough to blur action or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: images are fresh yet coherent (“headlights tasting the glass,” “patience with knuckles”), and most sentences do double duty for mood and information. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined; it forms a consistent metaphorical field around accounting, breath, and machinery rather than devolving into purple prose. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or template cadences, and rhythm adjusts effectively with tension (shorter beats around the shout and confrontation). Syntax is clean and clear throughout, with no artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, clean syntax, and images that usually do more than one job (world-building, theme, and emotion at once). Figurative language is frequent but patterned and purposeful, with few mixed metaphors or redundancies; the rhythm varies enough to keep the piece from feeling mechanical. A demanding editor might trim a handful of metaphoric flourishes that don’t add new pressure, as the density risks slight saturation. Still, clarity and the final cadence remain intact and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is excellent: sentences are musical, information-dense, and typically do multiple jobs (image, theme, character) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled; images like “a murder that had learned to bathe” or “beads threaded by someone else's error” feel sharp rather than ornamental. Rhythm varies enough to keep momentum, and key beats (the office, the father’s death, the final alliance) remain clear despite the lyric density. At times the sheer saturation of metaphor slightly blurs edges between distinct sensations, keeping this just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are often doing double duty for tone and theme, and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and purposeful, with recurring motifs (wind, chalk, maps, waves) reinforcing each other. A handful of near-gnomic formulations (“certainty is a boat that never docks nor rests”) risk feeling self-consciously quotable rather than organically observed. Overall, momentum and clarity remain intact despite the lyric lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but purposeful, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, emotion, and thematic charge—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent, maintaining a consistent aquatic/carnival lexicon rather than veering into mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm varies and supports momentum; there’s no noticeable synonym churn or template cadence. A few lines flirt with purple, but clarity and propulsion remain intact, including at the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but controlled; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and action) without redundancy or syntactic clutter. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and purposeful, extending core motifs of light, scars, and memory rather than spinning off mixed metaphors. There are no evident scaffold loops or template cadences, and the final third retains clarity while achieving a strong acoustic cadence (“there will be no second last”). Any hint of purple is counterbalanced by technical concreteness, keeping momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, character, and mood) with minimal scaffolding, and the rhythm on a read-aloud test is varied and controlled. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and motif-driven (iron, light, sound, water, magnetism) rather than mixed or muddy. There are no evident synonym loops or structural artifacts dulling momentum. The only limitation, at a prestige-lit bar, is that lushness sometimes slightly smooths over what little conflict exists, reinforcing the piece’s overall gentleness.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (world-building, character, theme) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but coherent and motif-driven (eyes, throats, alphabets, punctuation), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple thickets that would obscure sense. There are no evident paraphrase loops or mechanical cadences; instead, variation in structure and length sustains momentum in what is essentially a meditative narrative. The final third remains clear and sharp despite heightened imagery, allowing the closure images (the pupil, the condensation “applause”) to land without blur.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line by line, the prose is rich, precise, and high-density; most sentences do double or triple duty in image, mood, and concept. Figurative language is frequent but rarely feels mixed or muddled, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The main tradeoff is that the intensity of imagery is nearly unrelenting, which risks saturation without quite tipping into purple or obscuring sense. The final images (candle spared by breath, footsteps as ongoing score) are clear and powerful, capping the piece effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, images are mostly clean, and nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. The density of figurative language is high, yet it coheres around a consistent aquatic/temple/memory palette, avoiding true purple muddle. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases; the prose has clear propulsion despite its lyricism. A slight deduction comes from how unrelentingly ornate the diction is in high-pressure beats, which risks softening immediacy even though clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences vary in rhythm, are information-dense, and usually do more than one job (world, mood, and theme at once). Metaphor is frequent but rarely muddled; the central images (hush, copperlight, lattice, reef, wolves) stay coherent and interrelated. There is a mild risk of over-saturation—almost every line reaches for a striking figure—which can slightly blur individual beats rather than sharpening them. Nonetheless, clarity is preserved and the closure image lands cleanly, so the density reads as a controlled aesthetic choice rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is lush and metaphor-rich, yet most lines carry multiple jobs—advancing setting, theme, and emotion in concert—without slipping into muddle. Figurative language remains internally consistent (orchard as lung/ledger, veil as ash) and supports rather than obscures the action; crucial beats (the bead singing, the name spoken) are crystal-clear. There’s minimal scaffold or redundancy, and sentence rhythm varies effectively to keep momentum through a highly descriptive piece. Any risk of purple prose is counterbalanced by precision and narrative control, especially in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level work is dense but controlled: metaphors are fresh, coherent, and rarely feel redundant, and most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and meaning. Variations on sewing, tides, and light recur as purposeful patterns rather than loops, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism. A few lines arguably stack imagery (“orchid solace unfolding across stone”) to the edge of purple, and the uniformly heightened register gives little relief or textural contrast. These are minor enough not to harm closure but keep the craft just below the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and images that typically do more than one job (e.g., “bones looked less like endings and more like rested luggage” simultaneously advances plot, setting, and theme). The prose occasionally approaches saturation in figurative language but avoids mixed metaphors or confusion; the syntax remains clear even in lyric passages. There are no evident loops or scaffolding sentences; nearly every line earns its place. Rhythm supports the accumulative structure, opening up at reflective moments and tightening around the sundial/bread beats.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is finely crafted: sentences vary in length and rhythm, figurative language is inventive, and most lines do at least double duty (worldbuilding plus mood, or theme plus character). Despite density of imagery, clarity and forward motion are rarely compromised, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase-looping. Some metaphors could be pruned for maximum impact, but they rarely feel mixed or incoherent. The final paragraphs, in particular, balance lyricism with precision, landing on a charged, memorable image rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is dense but controlled: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and function, and the metaphors (stitching, weather, timing) remain coherent with the world’s logic. Repetition of phrases like “flame from eternal candle” reads as intentional motif rather than loop, and there are no significant scaffold sentences or synonym churn. Rhythm modulates well between longer, meditative lines and shorter, firmer closures at key turns. The prose’s richness never quite tips into opacity or purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong, with high information density—most sentences do double duty as image and emotional shading—and a clear rhythmic ear; there is little to no scaffolding or redundant phrasing. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically unified (tide, roots, glass, moonlight), and it rarely muddies sense; the few borderline-lush moments still remain legible. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and transitions between images are smooth despite the lyric intensity. If anything, the density of metaphor might slightly risk saturation for some readers, but it does not materially obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is rich and precise; most sentences do more than one job, advancing setting, emotion, and theme together. Figurative language is frequent but controlled by clear motifs of sea, tides, grafting, and maps, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple clutter. Momentum holds despite lyric density because each image either tilts the emotional stakes or develops the decoding/negotiation. A few abstractions (“objects can thread stories into bodies”) skate close to expositional, but they’re brief and supported by concrete surrounding detail.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-by-line, the prose is dense and multi-tasking, with many sentences advancing atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is mostly precise and coherent (“gate discovering it still swings,” “pockets sticky, heart light”), and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The main weakness is slight over-saturation: nearly every sentence carries a metaphor, which occasionally risks blurring edges and slowing momentum in what is already a low-plot, lyric piece. That said, clarity at the climax and ending remains intact, so the density feels like a deliberate stylistic choice rather than an artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: images are fresh (“tiny cranes unfolding from their paper sleep,” “breath under silk”) and rarely, if ever, feel mixed or overwrought. Sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, theme, and emotional texture—without redundancy or bogging momentum. There are no visible scaffold loops or template cadences; rhythm varies purposefully between long, lush lines and shorter, declarative ones to create breathing and emphasis. The closing sentences efficiently recharge earlier motifs (echo, path, waking) without explanatory clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are varied in rhythm, densely informative, and usually do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and conflict all at once). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple sprawl. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences, and the closure image is clean and strong. The metaphor density occasionally skirts overload but never quite undermines clarity, keeping it just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is lush yet mostly disciplined: figurative language is inventive and rarely confusing, and sentences typically do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Repetition is purposeful (e.g., echoing “shyly unstoppable,” ache→music→food) rather than redundant scaffolding. A handful of lines flirt with density overload, but they don’t obscure causality or closure, and there are no mixed metaphors that truly jar. Momentum is preserved across the piece despite its lyricism, with each paragraph adding new pressure or reconfiguring earlier images.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are dense yet clear, doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with very few strained or mixed metaphors; motifs like foxglove, cracks-as-maps, and ash-becoming-seed are coherent and cumulative. Momentum holds despite lyricism, aided by specific verbs and concrete actions (lighting, moving shelves, tracing echo with ink). A touch more variation in texture between high-pressure and calmer beats—slightly leaner prose during key turns—could refine it further.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually do more than one job (worldbuilding + emotional shading + theme). The metaphor web (music, grammar, weaving, vows) stays coherent and seldom feels strained; repetition (“carefully reckless,” “before paths diverge again”) reads as purposeful motif rather than loop. There’s mild risk of purple prose, but momentum is maintained and the closure image is sharp, not muddied. I see no significant scaffold, redundancy, or syntax artifacts that would need line edits before publication.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong syntactic variety and images that are vivid yet generally coherent (“seating rose like fossilized waves,” “a slyly heartfelt metronome”). Information density is high without major redundancy, and nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. A few spots flirt with purple or conceptual stacking, but they don't obscure cause/effect or the closure image. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors that damage momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally high: most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, character, theme) without obvious scaffolding, and metaphors are fresh and internally coherent (“night gathered, day loosened, the blooming withering hour”). There are no real loops or boilerplate; phrasing is varied and the piece reads smoothly aloud. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early and sustained, so it feels like deliberate style rather than purple drift, and closure remains crystal clear. A ruthless editor might trim a couple of near-synonymous atmospheric phrases to sharpen momentum around the launch and the waiting, but these are refinements, not structural debts.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, tightly constructed, and generally high in information density, often doing thematic, imagistic, and narrative work at once. Figurative language is abundant but coherent and pattern-consistent (light, grain, weather, flight), rarely veering into mixed-metaphor muddle. The closing sequence is particularly clean and resonant, with no visible scaffold or paraphrase loops dulling the image. A slight tendency toward saturation of metaphor in some mid-section lines is the only minor constraint keeping this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is lush and rhythmic, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and interiority (“like a lullaby written by engineers who knew metal could cradle anxiety the way moss cradles rain”). Information remains clear despite the density of figurative language, and there are few true redundancies or scaffolding phrases. However, metaphor is nearly continuous, sometimes piling simile upon simile, which risks slight saturation and occasional blur rather than focused sharpness. A few strategic cuts would turn already-strong prose into something razor-crisp for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, and theme) with minimal scaffolding and no obvious loops or filler. Figurative language is dense but generally coherent and fresh, and it passes the ear test with varied syntax and paragraph rhythm. A few moments (“cheerful as a bruise,” “cobweb math”) approach the edge of ornamental flourish, yet they still reinforce voice and theme rather than obscuring sense. There are no noticeable grammatical slips or sequencing confusions.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (image, concept, character) and the metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (metronomic sea, tidal ranks, diagonals). There are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops; momentum is steady despite the lyric density. Figurative language is frequent but not chaotic—the metaphoric field stays tight around music, tide, geometry, and city, so it reads as deliberate design rather than purple sprawl. A stricter pruning of a couple of ornamental phrases might heighten impact further, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, dense with information, and usually do double or triple duty for character, world, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and thematically coherent (tides, harbors, stars, wings), avoiding mixed or sloppy metaphors. There is minimal redundancy; each line feels necessary to the accumulative texture, and the closure image is clear and undulled by purple excess. A few phrases verge on abstraction, but they do not obscure causality or emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is highly controlled: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (image, theme, character) without collapsing into muddle. Figurative density is high but patterned and coherent, and the metaphors (glass, light, ledgers, ripples) stay within an intelligible system. There are no significant loops or scaffolding lines; momentum is maintained even in reflective stretches. The final lines land with clarity and resonance, not purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense, musical, and mostly precise; many sentences pull double duty for character and theme (“smoke etched into his pores, doubt braided into his quiet stride”). Information flows cleanly with minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. There is a high concentration of figurative language—“closing fist,” “fragile heartbeat,” “hard softness,” “navigation”—that occasionally edges toward purple, but metaphors remain consistent with the fire/sky/seed lexicon and rarely feel mixed. Tightening a handful of most-ornate lines would heighten impact without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is consistently strong, with high information density and multi-function sentences that carry setting, theme, and character at once. Metaphor is frequent but usually controlled and coherent, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. There are moments where figurative language stacks a bit (“tide-polished grotto breathed with the hush of a patient lung,” “sea wind solve for x,” etc.), creating a slight sense of uniform lushness that marginally softens impact. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, densely meaningful, and mostly do multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, theme) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; images like “footsteps bloomed where nothing moved” and “half-burned pages slumped like wilted fins” are fresh and legible. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and rhythm carries momentum even in reflective moments. A few lines verge on saturation of abstraction (e.g., “city of memory under the glaze”), but they do not blur causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is densely figurative yet mostly precise, with many sentences doing triple duty—advancing action, mood, and theme simultaneously. Recurring constructions like “prism parapet after rain” and “over the hush before bells ring” feel intentional as motifs rather than accidental loops. Clarity of action and image is maintained despite the lyrical density, and the closure beat lands cleanly. At times, the near-constant metaphorical pressure flirts with over-richness, but it rarely muddies meaning or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful metaphor, and minimal redundancy, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs (world, emotion, and theme). Figurative language is frequent but coherent, and images like “steam braid the air” or “my voice rattles around the reed like a sparrow in a bell” are vivid without obscuring sense. There are no significant loops, scaffolding phrases, or clarity issues, and the cadence carries momentum through a reflective, ritual-driven scene. A very slight risk of saturation in metaphor keeps it a hair below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense and image-rich, yet most metaphors are coherent and purposeful (salt as secret-keeper, egg as “unsent letter,” chamber as “throat” for sound). Sentences tend to do multiple jobs at once—worldbuilding, character, and theme—without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. There is mild risk of over-saturation in places, but rhythm and clarity hold, especially at the closure beat, which lands cleanly. No significant grammatical or sequencing issues interfere with momentum or understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (world, theme, character) with minimal scaffolding, and the rhythm of shorter and longer lines is well modulated. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and purposeful, with recurring motifs (breath, snow, ribbons, prisms) reinforcing structure rather than becoming decorative. There are few if any paraphrase loops or mechanical stems; the prose propels rather than stalls. The main constraint on a higher score is sheer metaphor saturation—nearly every line is lyrical—which, while beautiful, occasionally flattens contrast and can slightly blur sharpness of specific physical action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is consistently high: images are fresh (“rain…like distant pencil scratches,” argument words cooling into fossils), and sentences often do double duty for mood and theme. Figurative density is strong but rarely tips into muddle; motifs (light, reflection, hush, tide pool, dome) interlock coherently rather than competing. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; each paragraph advances either the ethical problem, the emotional state, or the setting’s charge. A few passages push toward lushness, but momentum and clarity remain intact through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is excellent: varied sentence rhythms, layered images that rarely feel mixed or overwrought, and near-zero scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is dense but purposeful; phrases like “the sky felt like a library closing” or “a ledger, proof that even the dim can write light” do multiple jobs at once. Momentum is maintained despite lyric mode because each sentence either advances action (building, orienting, tilting, dismantling) or deepens the emotional-textural stakes. The only ceiling is that the consistently elevated metaphor load may slightly blur urgency for some readers, keeping this just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is lush, information-dense, and mostly avoids redundancy: metaphors tend to do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) at once. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and motif-driven (metal, rope, breath, ice), so it reads as pattern rather than purple drift. A few lines approach saturation (“Transcribed memory is not bloodless; it swells and recedes, and it asks whether you are willing to be its shoreline”), but they remain intelligible and do not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure. There is very little scaffold or paraphrase-loop, and the prose carries momentum despite its lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world, character, theme) with few redundancies, and the rhythm flexes between lush description and sharper beats. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and grounded in the story’s sensory palette (rust, rain, paths, seals), maintaining momentum. There are almost no scaffolding phrases or paraphrase loops; information density stays high. The main constraint is that metaphor saturation edges close to excess in places, which marginally blurs the sharpness of a few images.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense yet disciplined, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, psychology, and thematic signaling—without evident scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and patterned (economy, ledgers, repairs, dust), avoiding mixed metaphors or clarity loss. Rhythm varies between long, flowing lines and tighter beats at decision points (“He did not gasp, because the passage did not open with miracle, but with the practiced thrift of doors long kept”), supporting the contemplative pressure. The only minor limitation is that the sustained lyricism could, for some readers, slightly blunt urgency, but it does not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are information-dense and multi-functional, often advancing atmosphere, theme, and character in one move (“banners fluttered and then hung down, remembering wind as lecture instead of order”). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and legible, rarely feeling like decorative excess. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or syntactic templates; rhythm adapts to pressure. The consistently lush lyricism edges close to purple at moments, but it remains under control and does not blur causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: nearly every line carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) and the figurative language is largely coherent and fresh (“bell with velvet clapper,” “drawing routes of light the way bees remember bloom”). Rhythm varies and there are no obvious synonym loops, scaffolding sentences, or clarity-breaking metaphors despite the density. The only minor limitation is the relentless lyricism; a few plainer sentences might sharpen contrast and impact for some readers, but it doesn’t materially muddy closure. Grammar and sequencing remain clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (world, character, theme) and carry fresh images without collapsing into purple. Figurative language is dense but controlled, with very few mixed or strained metaphors; rhythm supports the accumulative, reflective mode without bogging. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffold, and syntax remains clear despite the lyricism. A slight reduction in aphorism density at a couple beats could sharpen momentum even further.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion or theme), and images are fresh and internally coherent (“petals edited the air,” “seeds small as commas”). There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; the piece moves forward cleanly despite its reflective bent. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with very few mixed or strained metaphors, and the rhythm varies pleasantly across the paragraphs. A handful of lines edge toward conceptual summary (“the art of debts that pay themselves”) but they remain grounded enough not to blur momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but highly controlled: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, character) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and motif-driven (music/silence, books/botany, gaps/negatives) rather than mixed for its own sake. There are no notable scaffold loops or synonym churn; each line advances atmosphere or stakes. The opening and closing lines form a strong rhythmic and imagistic frame without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are musical, image-dense, and generally multitask (character, world, and theme at once). The figurative language is mostly fresh and legible, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy; each sentence tends to earn its place. However, the near-constant metaphorical pressure occasionally risks saturation, leaving a few moments (e.g., multiple similes in quick succession) feeling slightly over-ornate. That density keeps the piece just below the very top band in terms of clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, theme) with little fat, and the rhythm varies nicely. Metaphors are mostly fresh and coherent (“fables of absence… like careful smoke,” “gear teeth leaned… with civic patience”), and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. There is a consistent high-lyric register that risks slight sameness over the length, with several sentences echoing similar structures (“I [verb], and…”), but it doesn’t materially drag momentum or clarity. With a touch more variation at high-pressure beats or one or two sharper, plainer lines to cut through the lyric fog, this would edge into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and thematic pressure) with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is dense but patterned—auroral threads, stone lungs, iron remembering fire—and rarely drifts into mixed or confusing metaphor. Rhythm varies and the prose has clear propulsion despite being contemplative. There is some risk of over-saturation in the middle stretch, but it does not materially obscure causality or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-by-line, the prose is unusually strong: dense without being muddled, with most sentences doing double duty (world-building and emotion, or action and theme) and very little scaffold or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned; images of sound, light, and water interlock instead of clashing. Syntax and paragraphing support momentum—especially around the failed first attempt and the recalibrated second—while still allowing lyric accumulation. A touch more spareness in one or two metaphor-heavy stretches could sharpen impact further, but clarity and propulsion remain intact through the close.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose maintains high information density with very few wasted lines; almost every sentence does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and character) without evident scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Metaphors are original yet coherent (“storms are honest about which wood floats”; “as if the city's exhale froze midstory”) and rarely feel strained. Rhythm is varied and purposeful, and the closure paragraph lands cleanly without over-explaining its own imagery. A small handful of abstract formulations could be marginally tightened, but they do not dull momentum or blur the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is precise, musical, and information-dense; almost every sentence does double duty for atmosphere and character or theme. Metaphor is largely coherent and fresh (children counting breaths, fire as “memory deciding finally to speak,” ivy’s “tiny applause”), and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. There is a very high density of figurative language, especially in the middle, that edges toward overrichness and could risk reader fatigue in a longer piece. Even so, clarity is never lost, and the closing beats land cleanly and powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and many sentences doing double duty (advancing emotional stakes while enriching setting or theme). Rhythm varies well, and there are no meaningful clarity lapses or scaffold/loop artifacts. The main debit is a very high metaphor density—nearly every sentence is figurative—which occasionally risks a slight sense of over-saturation, though physical logic and imagery remain coherent. Overall, the prose is polished enough for elite venues, with only minimal tightening needed for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but efficient: most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, theme plus action), and figurative language is coherent and purposeful rather than piled-on for its own sake. There are no evident loops or scaffolding repetitions; echoes like “limiting exposure” and “walls sprinting inward” mark structural motifs, not redundancy. Syntax and paragraphing create clear momentum through the tasting sequence into the alloying moment and the descent, with no confusion over action order. A few metaphors flirt with abstraction, but they remain anchored enough not to blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is high: sentences are varied, dense, and generally do double duty, carrying worldbuilding and emotional pressure without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Imagery is vivid but controlled; metaphors extend coherently from the established conceit of sound and motion (rails as tutors, bridges of lullabies, hush as harbor). The rhythm flexes with the scene, lengthening in reflective stretches and tightening around the bell’s disruption and the technical adjustments. At moments the figurative load is quite rich and could risk saturation for some readers, but clarity of action and closure is never compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, metaphors are mostly coherent, and almost every line does at least double duty in advancing image, world, or theme. Figurative language is dense but controlled; patterns around media, broadcast, and time-tuning are consistent and avoid mixed metaphors. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the prose reads smoothly aloud, especially in passages like the murals sequence and the root-room ascent. A few phrases edge toward purple or self-conscious (“nostalgia of a frontier,” “mouth of the throat”) and the unchanging lushness can slightly blur urgency, preventing an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do two or three jobs at once (image, theme, and forward motion), with few redundancies. The prose treads close to purple in spots but generally avoids muddle; metaphors stay thematically aligned with breath, fire, thresholds, and shame. Rhythm varies well between longer cadenced sentences and shorter, anchoring lines. A slight uniformity of metaphorical mode (almost every line figurative) keeps it just shy of flawless at elite-journal standards.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level writing is lush yet controlled; nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, voice, theme) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors extend coherently from a small set of domains (pressure, sea, light, structure) and rarely clash, keeping clarity intact even in the most figurative lines. Rhythm varies well, with longer braided sentences balanced by short, declarative closures (“a gentler geology”). Despite the density of imagery, the sequence of events in the chamber and at the ending remains legible and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is elegant and information-dense; most sentences do multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, and world-building at once) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and voice-true, with only a few lines flirting with purple without tipping into muddle (“nostalgia of shells people use instead of hearts”). Rhythm varies well, and there are no significant clarity issues or causality obscured by prose. The final image cleanly recharges early motifs (“first yawn of evening,” golden shadows, bridge of intuition) without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is dense and controlled: metaphors are imaginative yet mostly coherent (“citrus constellations,” “liquid night toward a copper still shaped like prayer”) and sentences carry multiple jobs without obvious scaffolding or loops. The prose sustains a high figurative register throughout without collapsing into confusion, and the final cadence (“keep the shape of possibility ripening”) elegantly echoes the opening. At times the intensity of imagery risks slight saturation, which may feel a hair overwrought for some top-tier venues, but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, character) with minimal redundancy, and rhythm varies in a way that suits the contemplative mode. Figurative language is dense but coherent and rarely feels mixed or purple; “a held breath,” “origami doubt,” and “small proof” are striking yet clear. There are no significant scaffold phrases or synonym loops; nearly every line earns its place. The only restraint on a higher score is the sheer volume of metaphor, which risks saturation even though it remains intelligible.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and action), rhythm varies, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled, with only a couple of slightly showy lines (“how to arrest light”) that don’t undermine clarity. Repetition of key phrases (“map suggested by puddle reflections at dusk,” “carefully resourceful,” “coded freedom”) reads as intentional motif rather than artifact. Momentum holds from start to finish; there are no expository stalls or confusing syntactic tangles to erode the climax or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: imagery is dense yet coherent, with very few mixed metaphors and almost no redundant scaffolding. Sentences typically do multiple jobs—advancing action, deepening world rules, and reinforcing theme (“I answer with absence, proving the beat by removing it, turning the groove inside out”). The repetition of key phrases (“vested hush,” “negative space,” “as dewdrops form”) is patterned and functional rather than loop-like. A slight risk of sensory and figurative saturation remains, but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but controlled; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and thematic shading) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent yet patterned and coherent—seeds, leaves, wind, and grammar motifs recur in ways that support rather than muddle sense. The syntax varies enough to keep momentum, and the climactic beats (“release, not store; scatter, not save”) land with clean, sharpened phrasing. A hair more air around a few image-stacked sentences could enhance readability, but the current density does not obstruct the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is high: nearly every sentence carries more than one job (image, theme, and motion), and rhythm varies smoothly between short emphatic beats and longer lyric ones. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with images that are coherent and character-driven rather than mixed for effect. There is essentially no scaffold, synonym churn, or paraphrase looping; the prose keeps advancing situation and idea. At times density edges right up to the border of purple, but clarity and momentum remain intact, including at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: high information density, vivid images doing double duty for world and psyche, and minimal redundancy. Metaphors are mostly coherent and grounded in the story’s material domain (metal, weight, scales, seams), creating a unified texture. The prose does flirt with over-density—nearly every sentence is metaphorically charged—which might slightly fatigue a reader at elite venues, though clarity remains intact. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences, and the final images land clean and sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is excellent: most sentences perform multiple functions (image, emotion, worldbuilding) and the rhythm reads cleanly aloud. Figurative language is rich but rarely overwrought; images like “a rope thrown to air, a rope that held nobody” are precise and emotionally sharp. There are a few moments of stacked metaphor or conceptual redundancy, but they do not materially blur sense or slow momentum. Syntax and punctuation are clean, and the final cadence lands with clarity and charge.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences multitask, carrying setting, emotion, and theme together, and rhythm varies effectively between dense metaphor and pared-down declaratives. A few lines edge toward abstraction or conceptual stacking (“displaced rooted, the way a tree lives where its seed was thrown”; the explicit mercy equation) but they remain legible and character-voiced. There’s little redundancy or filler; each paragraph advances pressure or reframes a motif. Figurative density is high but controlled enough that momentum is not significantly dragged.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush but generally efficient: most images do double duty, advancing setting and theme while characterizing the narrator’s way of seeing. Figurative language is frequent yet controlled; metaphors tend to be coherent extensions of the light/rope/market lexicon rather than mixed ornaments. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and sentence variety sustains strong oral rhythm. A few constructions verge on saturation (“caravans of light whisper across the gaps between breathing and stone”), but they do not obscure causality or blur the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is remarkably controlled: high information density, nearly every sentence doing double duty for atmosphere and meaning, with inventive but legible metaphors (“cotton candy without a stick,” “smiled like a nick in brass”). Figurative language is frequent but not muddled; images extend and echo rather than collide, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping or filler scaffolding. Syntax and paragraphing create a smooth propulsion through what is essentially one long scene, with no grammatical stumbles or clarity issues. If anything, the prose’s lushness could risk excess in longer work, but here it remains taut enough to support the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but controlled; figurative language is nearly always coherent with the world’s logic (clouds with spines, glass as fruit, frost as type) and doesn’t blur action. Sentences tend to do multiple jobs at once—worldbuilding, emotion, and thematic work—without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. The climactic beats (“a moment so dense I could feel it lean against my ribs…”) remain clear in causality despite high lyric pressure. There are no mechanical errors or rhythm artifacts that dull closure; the final line is clean and quietly decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are musical yet clear, with varied syntax and high information density; almost every line pulls double duty for worldbuilding and emotional charge. Figurative language is frequent but patterned and coherent rather than muddled, maintaining a consistent metaphorical logic around time, metal, and liturgy. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops, clunky explanations, or copy errors, and rhythm adjusts appropriately around key beats (the storm strike, the judge’s ruling, the quiet in Neris’s quarters). The prose flirts with maximalism but remains controlled enough that momentum never collapses under ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, but the metaphors are mostly precise and mutually reinforcing rather than muddled, and nearly every line does double duty for image and theme. There are no significant paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences; momentum carries cleanly from setup through climax to closure. A few images lean toward saturation (“tinkersong wonder blossomed”) yet they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure beat. Overall line-level craft is polished and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is very strong: high information density per sentence, minimal scaffolding, and a rhythm that matches the accumulating hush and strangeness. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and grounded in the story’s sensory logic (hinges, breath, veining, diaries of scratches). There are no significant paraphrase loops or structural artifacts, and the closure image is clean and readable. The only drawback is a slight risk of saturation—nearly every line is metaphorical—which may blur impact for some readers but does not materially obscure causality or cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is highly accomplished: sentences are musical, information-dense, and multi-tasking, with very few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Figurative language is fresh and largely coherent, and each paragraph advances atmosphere, character, or thematic pressure. There is some risk of overpacking metaphors—nearly every line reaches for an image—which may fatigue a reader at elite-publication standards, but clarity remains intact. No major artifacts, loops, or cadence templates dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: images are fresh (“snow thinned into lace,” “white throats silvering the air”) and rarely, if ever, feel mixed or redundant. Figurative density is high but purposeful, with most sentences advancing both sensory texture and theme. There are no noticeable scaffolding phrases, synonym loops, or mechanical cadences, and the prose reads fluently aloud. Any minor luxuriance in description doesn’t impede clarity or momentum, especially given the lyric, accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but generally controlled, with many lines doing double duty for image and theme (“both smelling of unfinished sentences”). Figurative language is frequent yet coherent; motifs of heat, glass, wreckage, and grammar interlock rather than tangle. There are almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and momentum rarely stalls despite the lyric register. A few lines flirt with over-packed abstraction, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence-level craft is dense but purposeful: most lines do double or triple duty in imagery, worldbuilding, and theme without obvious redundancy. Rhythm varies well, with longer, sinuous sentences balanced by shorter declaratives that land turns (“Not a spell, but a civilization conceived at weather’s lip, held to shape by light.”). Figurative language is frequent but coherent; motifs of light, tide, and bone stay consistent and do not muddy sense. The only arguable drawback is a uniformly high lyric register that may slightly dampen immediacy for some readers, but it does not impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence does double duty in image and function, and rhythm varies thoughtfully to sustain a slow-blooming tension. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and character-specific; there are very few mixed or slack metaphors, and no obvious loops or scaffolding. A slight tendency toward unrelenting ornament risks saturation in places, but clarity and momentum remain intact, especially around the prophecy turn and closing decision. Copy-level mechanics are clean, and the final image is sharp rather than over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is abundant but generally coherent and thematically aligned with vortices, cold, and order/entropy, avoiding mixed-metaphor muddle. Rhythm varies effectively, and the final paragraphs sharpen into concrete sensory prose (“fine nap like frost that never melts”) to ground the lyricism. The density of metaphor approaches purple in places, which may slightly blur immediacy for some readers, but it never seriously obscures causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but purposeful; most sentences do at least double duty in setting, character, and theme without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Rhythm varies enough to keep the lyricism from becoming monotonous, and images are internally consistent (wind, ropes, sanctuary) rather than a grab-bag of metaphors. A few phrases flirt with purple (“the nave of wind,” “evening bled gold into the clouds”), yet they remain legible and on-motif rather than muddling sense. There are no noticeable grammatical slips or structural artifacts, and momentum carries smoothly through to the charged final line.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is dense and purposeful: most sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, emotional shading) without collapsing into mush. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and fresh, with minimal paraphrase loops or slack scaffolding. Rhythm varies between long, sinuous lines and clipped pivots in a way that supports the accumulative mood. A few metaphors risk saturation or near-redundancy in the final third, but they don’t significantly obscure sense or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is highly polished: varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that often do double duty (world-building and theme at once). Figurative language is dense but mostly precise and legible; key beats (opening the box, performing the ritual, the final walk) are not obscured by purple flourish. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every sentence carries new information or nuance. The near-constant metaphorical pressure risks slight overload in places, which may make some lines feel ornamental rather than strictly necessary at an elite editorial standard.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, character, theme) with little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but coherent and pattern-consistent (“clicked like bone understanding bone,” “time revealed itself as weave and grain”), avoiding mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies naturally and supports momentum; the prose rarely feels static despite being reflective. There are no noticeable loops, filter-verb stacks, or artifacts that blur causality or the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is highly polished: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally do multiple jobs at once. Figurative language is frequent but pattern-consistent and rarely feels muddled or redundant; images of weaving, music, wind, and water cohere. A few metaphors verge on preciousness, but they do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the final lines land with clarity and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often do double duty for worldbuilding, character, and theme. The figurative language is frequent but largely precise and coherent (“granite whales,” “green lung of fruiting oaks”), with minimal redundancy or scaffolding. The only restraint on higher scores is that the density of metaphor occasionally edges toward uniformity, leaving little rhythmic contrast between high-pressure and reflective moments.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is dense and musical, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and concept at once) and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent—“garden birds scratching curiosities from the wet hedges as if history itched” is typical of the precise strangeness. Momentum is steady despite lyricism; syntax varies and the closure image is clear and undulled by ornament. A slight uniform lushness in texture keeps it just shy of absolute top-tier tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is dense but remarkably controlled: metaphors are coherent, multipurpose, and rarely feel redundant, and nearly every sentence advances both atmosphere and theme. Rhythm varies well, with longer braided lines balanced by shorter, declarative ones (“Dead reef to feed the living shore; fallen bone to brace a sprout with remembering.”). There is a lot of figurative language, but in a clearly taught lyric pattern, and it doesn’t blur sense or closure. A very exacting editor might trim one or two slightly overlapped formulations about grammar/peace, but there are no significant loops or muddles.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: most sentences carry dual or triple duty (worldbuilding, emotion, and forward motion) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but coherent and thematically aligned; metaphors like “wax keeps light like a thought inside a thought” deepen rather than clutter. There are no meaningful loops or template cadences, and the rhythm at the ending lands with a clean, earned softness. The only restraint on a higher score is that the near-constant metaphorical register, while beautiful, leaves little contrast or sparseness in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but purposeful; most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action) with very little scaffold or redundancy. Metaphors are generally coherent and apt to the world (“the valley hummed back…a quiet order that made the smear a song”), and sentence rhythms vary nicely. A high concentration of figurative language risks occasional purple-tinge but rarely clouds meaning or momentum. Syntax, grammar, and sequencing remain clean, and the closure image is sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: dense but purposeful imagery, minimal scaffolding, and high information-per-sentence with almost no redundancy. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and thematically aligned with time, listening, and altitude, avoiding mixed metaphors that would blur sense. The prose sustains momentum despite lyricism, and the final paragraph crisply recharges prior motifs without over-explaining. There is mild risk of sensory/metaphoric saturation, but it never materially confuses causality or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is highly polished: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (world, emotion, concept) with minimal redundancy, and imagery is original yet controlled. The prose occasionally edges toward density that risks saturation, but it mostly avoids mixed metaphors and maintains clear through-lines of sense (e.g., crisis-as-grammar, walking-as-writing). There are almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and syntax varies to support momentum in an otherwise contemplative piece. A couple of metaphoric clusters (“luminous absence,” “nomadic penumbra”) verge on self-conscious if isolated, but the story’s internal logic sustains them.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is very strong: sentences carry multiple layers of work (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and rhythm varies in a controlled, musical way. Figurative density is high, but the pattern is taught from the first line and sustained with internal logic, avoiding mixed or incoherent metaphors; images like “rain remembering a drought” or “a sigh that seems ashamed of how much it remembers” are both clear and surprising. There are no obvious loops, filter-verb stacks, or grammatical slips that impede momentum or clarity, and the closure image lands cleanly. The only slight drawback is that, for some readers, the unrelieved metaphorical richness may risk mild saturation—but it does not materially obscure causality or the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence-level craft is very strong: images are vivid, metaphors coherent and extended rather than stacked at random, and almost every line does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character at once). Repetition is patterned (“hush,” “thunder,” chess terms) rather than looped scaffolding, and there’s no synonym churn or template cadence. Rhythm varies well across the piece, with longer, meditative lines in reflection and tighter, more tactile phrasing during the knotting sequence. Density is high but not purple; clarity of action and emotional stakes is never obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but purposeful, with most sentences doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action). Metaphors are largely coherent and thematically aligned (forged hush, prisms of breath and bone, lullaby that remembers teeth), and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. The rhythm varies well, and the final lines land cleanly without figurative muddle. A few images flirt with ornamental excess, but they do not obscure sense or slow momentum in a way that harms closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is rich and often beautiful, with high information density—most sentences do double duty in worldbuilding and emotional shading. Extended metaphors (e.g., molten charm “like a memory warmed by tears”) generally hold together and serve the piece’s logic. There is a persistent high figurative density that edges toward purple in places, but it rarely obscures clarity or stalls momentum. Slight tightening of a few metaphor stacks could heighten impact further, but the prose is already at a strong, publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, little to no scaffolding, and images that often do multiple jobs at once (e.g., the rain line off-shore both sets atmosphere and mirrors his internal threshold). Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and grounded in the established water/light lexicon, avoiding mixed metaphors. The uniformity of sentence length and the relentless lyricism risk mild saturation, yet clarity and forward motion are preserved through clean sequencing. A bit more rhythmic variation or a few plainer lines at key stress points could deepen contrast and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush, metaphor-rich, and largely successful: images like “the cobalt lighthouse at dawn stands breathing like a great blue lung” and “a shawl over a newborn” are vivid, apt, and layered. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (setting, character, and theme) without obvious redundancy, and syntactic variation keeps the piece from droning. The figurative saturation is near the upper limit—almost every line carries an image—which risks purple excess in places and produces a few slightly abstract formulations (“does not injure air”). Still, clarity of action and emotional throughline are never lost, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level work is dense but precise: metaphors are fresh, coherent, and seldom piled to the point of opacity. Sentences do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, emotion, and action in “I thread the censer foot on a rod, lash rope to a tide wheel, and lean my weight into the arc”). There’s no meaningful synonym-churn or scaffold; each line introduces a new angle or pressure. The only arguable risk is sustained figurative richness, but it remains legible and aligned with the character’s mind under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: almost every sentence carries multiple loads (world, character, theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and coherent, and the prose maintains momentum despite its density. The opening and closing lines are especially sharp, bracketing the piece with charged images. A few lines verge on saturation of metaphor, but they do not muddy sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is highly crafted, with vivid metaphors that usually do double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is minor risk of figurative saturation—nearly every sentence carries an image—which could fatigue some readers and very slightly softens impact by diminishing contrast. Nonetheless, clarity is never lost, and there are no notable loops or scaffolding sentences. Because the lushness is pattern-taught from the first line and paid off thematically, it reads as an intentional aesthetic rather than purple excess, just shy of razor-perfect economy.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally controlled: sentences are varied in rhythm and structure, metaphors are fresh and coherent, and nearly every line carries multiple functions (image, emotion, theme). There is no evident scaffolding, synonym churn, or paraphrase loops; the prose feels lean despite its lyric density. High-pressure beats (“the rock trembled like paper under a burin,” “a seam of water opened in the air”) remain lucid and propulsive. The final line’s glimmer reprises earlier motifs cleanly, recharging meaning without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush yet efficient; most lines carry at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or image plus theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are largely coherent and thematically aligned (lace, glass, bleeding light, lungs), avoiding mixed-vehicle confusion. There is some risk of saturation—nearly every sentence contains an image—but the piece teaches this lyric pattern early and maintains clarity at peak beats, including the circlet-laying and wound-stitching. Syntax and paragraphing provide a strong auditory rhythm that supports the mythic tone without becoming sing-song or monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are often surprising yet coherent, and nearly every line carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme). Metaphor density is high but mostly controlled; phrases like “presence compresses, warm as a held breath, dense as freshly poured grain” feel precise rather than overstuffed. There is mild risk of purple prose and a couple of figurative turns that are clever for their own sake, which slightly thicken the texture without adding new pressure. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the closing cadence is clean and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: high information density, varied syntax, and metaphors that carry conceptual and emotional load rather than decorative excess. There is a lot of figurative language, but it’s patterned, purposeful, and rarely confusing. A few lines (“a calendar that never learned digits,” “a quiet ledger where every page signed back”) flirt with abstraction without always adding new pressure, which introduces a trace of ornamental feel. Nonetheless, clarity and propulsion hold, and the closure image is clean and undulled by purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is consistently strong: images like “her jaw like someone holding back a hillside” and “rain script that can be read with breath” are fresh, coherent, and information-dense. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and almost every line advances either character, atmosphere, or theme without redundant scaffolding. The metaphor density is high but not yet purple; there are few, if any, mixed or muddled images, and causality remains clear. A slight trimming of explicitly explanatory phrases could make the prose even sharper, but it already reads at a publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with minimal redundancy, and the piece reads cleanly aloud. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and controlled; images extend the storm/tea/runic motifs rather than scattering. A few lines approach the edge of saturation, but they don’t blur sense or the closure image, so momentum holds. There are no evident scaffolds, loops, or syntactic templates that feel like artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled, with images that usually do multiple jobs (world-building, tone, and emotional state) in a single stroke, e.g., “paper whispering like leaves that refused to remember wind.” Syntax varies, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence carries new information or reweights existing elements. The figurative language is rich but occasionally approaches saturation, which very slightly dulls impact in a few mid-paragraph stretches. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact throughout, including at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose shows strong rhythmic control, varied syntax, and high information density; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding and interiority, or atmosphere and theme) without obvious scaffolding. Extended metaphors (door as breath, water as lens, constellations of dust) are coherent and not piled so thickly that they obscure sense. There’s minimal redundancy and no significant looped paraphrase; each circle around the dais adds texture rather than restating. A few lines flirt with abstraction (“definitions began to include everything that had been refusing them”), but context keeps them intelligible.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is unusually strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (setting, mood, interiority, and theme) with minimal scaffold or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and non-muddled; images like “a held note lodged in the throat of the world” and “a line so clean it could have shaved the moon” are precise and fresh. There’s a consistent lyric pressure without noticeable template cadence or synonym churn, and the prose reads aloud with varied rhythm. The very high density of metaphor might, for some markets, flirt with overrichness, but it doesn’t significantly harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) and rhythm varies in step with the scene’s quiet pressure. Imagery is inventive but generally coherent, and there is little redundancy or scaffolding; each line tends to earn its presence. A few metaphors and abstractions (“physics of letting go,” “familiar stranger moment turning into kinship”) are repeated enough to risk mild over-signaling. Nonetheless, momentum holds, and the closure image is clear and undulled by purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, images are largely precise and multi-functional, and there’s impressive information density without bloat. The figurative language is frequent but purposeful—probability, maps, light, and rain metaphors are coherent and reinforce each other rather than tangling. I see little to no scaffolding, repetition, or muddled metaphor; nearly every line either advances scene, character, or theme. The only arguable limitation is that the lushness is sustained at a fairly high level, which some editors might want trimmed slightly in the highest-pressure beats, but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: high information density, nearly every line carrying multiple jobs (image, theme, character) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Metaphors are fresh and coherent; I see no mixed images that blur meaning, and rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. The prose is consistently lush, which risks slight over-saturation, but clarity and momentum are maintained and the closure image is sharp. There are no noticeable grammatical or sequencing slips.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush and metaphor-rich but largely controlled, with most lines doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (“walnut hulls dark as bruised moons sigh in the water, surrendering a brown galaxy”). Rhythm varies, and there are few if any true scaffolding or paraphrase loops; the piece maintains momentum despite its reflective mode. A couple of abstractions (“haunted euphoria,” “exact flavor of duty”) flirt with overstatement, and figurative density is consistently high enough that a demanding editor might trim a handful of images. Nonetheless, clarity and closure are never obscured, and the final paragraphs land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is strong: high information density, very few redundant sentences, and images that usually do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme). Metaphor use is heavy but intentional and mostly lucid; it builds a recognizable idiom instead of devolving into noise. Occasional flourishes (“as if handing over weather,” “a whisper adjusting its coat”) flirt with ornateness but stay legible and apt. There are no obvious scaffolds, loops, or syntactic monotony issues, and the cadence of sentences supports the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most metaphors cohere with the established sound/touch lexicon. Repetition (quiet blaze, constellations, ring, stillpoint) functions as pattern rather than loop, recharging meaning at the close. Figurative density is high but disciplined, and action/order remains clear despite the lyric mode. There are almost no scaffolding sentences or paraphrase loops, though a few lines border on ornate without adding new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is densely figurative but remarkably clean: metaphors are mostly sharp, fresh, and non-redundant, and nearly every line does multiple jobs (world, character, and theme). Rhythm varies well, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The main weakness is occasional saturation—nearly every sentence aims for a striking image, which risks slight overrichness even if it doesn’t obscure causality. The final cadence is strong and uncluttered, preserving the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: images are vivid yet controlled, and most sentences pull double duty for atmosphere, character, and theme (“rope fibers sighing, cleats ticking, oars purring”). The figurative density is high, but metaphors stay coherent within the sea/moon/music/silence lattice and rarely feel strained. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; the prose flows with good rhythmic variety and read-aloud musicality. It flirts with purple in a few phrases, but never to the point of obscuring clarity or dulling the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, theme) without redundancy, and rhythm is varied and intentional. Imagery is lush and original (“each mote a retired constellation auditing the shelves of memory”) yet rarely clutters causality or scene action; metaphoric density remains legible. There are a few moments of near-purple compression or cleverness-for-its-own-sake, but they do not blur the climax or final image. No significant scaffolding, loops, or template cadences are apparent, and grammar and sequencing are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-by-line, the prose is dense but purposeful; most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, and action) without slipping into redundancy or confusion. Metaphors are original and coherent with the sound/light motif, and key beats (“I became the dock and the boat and the tide”) remain legible. There is a near-constant lyric intensity that, in a top-tier venue, might invite very slight trimming for contrast and breath, but it rarely feels muddled or gratuitous. No major loops, scaffolding, or filter-verb stacks drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is highly polished: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and action, and metaphors are coherent and grounded in the world (steel, sound, weather). There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding; each beat adds new texture or advances the situation. Figurative density is high but pattern-consistent, avoiding muddle or cliché, and the prose modulates well between compressed lyric lines and more straightforward exposition. A touch more variation in sentence structure at a few points could heighten propulsion, but momentum rarely drags.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are vivid, sentences multi-functional, and there is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase-looping. Figurative language is dense but mostly disciplined, and metaphors tend to cohere around water, light, pages, and shutters rather than scattering. The prose sustains momentum despite its lyricism, with action beats (the mirror guiding the boy, the brother’s emergence) clearly staged and easy to follow. A few phrases verge on ornamental or slightly over-rich, but they do not materially obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but purposeful: images like “zugzwang” boards in windows and “starlight measuring time more kindly than bells” do multiple jobs at once. There’s no real scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony; nearly every sentence adds either image, structure, or theme. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and pattern-taught, so it supports rather than obscures clarity or closure. A few metaphors (“forests of second thoughts,” “second thoughts spread like fungi”) verge on overt thematic labeling, slightly softening the otherwise razor-sharp subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is lush but disciplined: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent and grounded in the maritime frame, avoiding mixed or strained images despite high density. Momentum is maintained across long, lyric lines; there are no significant loops, scaffolding, or clarity failures, including at closure. The only slight limit is that the relentless figurativeness may feel just short of the absolute precision demanded at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: images like “iron scythes that never finish the harvest of sound” and “small applause of falling shavings” are vivid, apt, and multi-functioning. Sentences generally do more than one job—advancing scene, character, and theme simultaneously—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The prose is dense with metaphor but avoids muddle or contradiction; rhythm and syntax are varied enough to keep momentum. It stops just short of top-tier only because the unrelenting lyricism risks slight saturation rather than occasionally sharpening by contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is very strong: high information density, little to no scaffolding, and sentences that usually do more than one job (world, theme, character) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but pattern-taught and coherent, with metaphors (ice/opinion/border; hum/law) reinforcing one another rather than clashing. There are a few moments where abstraction edges toward overload (“stack of blank dates,” “calendar that never got to happen”) but they remain legible and tonally aligned. Momentum holds across the piece despite the lyric mode; no significant loops or redundancies dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: nearly every sentence is packed with information and image, yet the prose remains legible and propulsive. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early (“where light leans,” “angle of seeing”) and remains coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. There are no noticeable scaffold or synonym loops; each new line tends to add a facet or move the tableau forward. Minor risk is that some images (“like dawn departing night’s window”) flirt with ornament, but they still support the emotional beat rather than stalling it.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical yet clear, often doing double duty for image and concept, and there’s minimal redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically unified around sound, light, and pilgrimage, avoiding mixed-metaphor confusion. Momentum is appropriate for a lyric piece; each paragraph genuinely adds pressure or nuance rather than rephrasing prior points. Very occasional density borders on ornamental, but it doesn’t materially obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with minimal redundancy, and the metaphors are mostly coherent, sustained, and apt. The prose flirts with lushness but rarely tips into purple; images like “paper uncreasing itself” and “dawn braided from patience” exemplify precision rather than ornament. Momentum is preserved despite lyric density because each sentence either advances the ritual or deepens the emotional and conceptual stakes. There are no evident scaffold loops or clarity-breaking figurative tangles, though an editor might pare a handful of metaphors for maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences carry high information density, often doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and the rhythm flows smoothly across the piece. Figurative language is frequent but patterned and legible; images extend one another instead of clashing, so the lyric richness doesn’t dissolve clarity. There’s little scaffolding or repetition—nearly every line introduces a fresh facet of the method, world, or emotional stance. A touch of metaphor saturation around the midpoint slightly softens momentum, but the closure beat is clean and sharply phrased.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is dense, original, and mostly precise; metaphors are inventive and usually coherent, and nearly every sentence carries multiple layers of work (world, emotion, theme). The rhythm varies nicely, and there’s very little scaffolding or repetition. However, figurative saturation is very high almost everywhere, which can mildly blur a few images and make the pressure feel more gauzy than it needs to, especially around explanations of the ancestors’ method. For a top-shelf market, this is still highly publishable but would benefit from a few surgical simplifications for sharper impact.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is outstanding: nearly every sentence does double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action), with no obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is abundant but controlled; recurring images (petals, stone, clouds, film) build a coherent metaphor field rather than competing. Rhythm varies, with longer, lush sentences balanced by shorter crystallizing ones (“What it wants is not escape; what it wants is to preserve the shape of hope.”). There are no grammatical slips, clarity failures, or overwrought metaphors that muddy the climax or ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most metaphors are apt and mutually reinforcing rather than showy. The prose often does double duty, advancing both atmosphere and ethical tension in a single line (“keeping one to remind me that faith without care becomes a blade”). There is a slight tendency toward metaphor saturation, which risks feeling a touch ornamental in places, but clarity and momentum are never lost, including at the ending. No obvious scaffolding, loops, or filter stacks mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, metaphor chains are coherent and thematic, and most lines do double or triple duty (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). Figurative density is high but pattern-consistent and rarely overwrought; images like “meteor hush that rings like distant glass” or “sap rises like a sigh, amber and patient” are vivid and precise. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; momentum flows smoothly through the lyrical prose to the closure image. A touch more spareness at one or two mid-story beats could sharpen contrast, but clarity and propulsion are not compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is strong: metaphors are inventive, often doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“saving rain that fell between drops”), and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Syntax varies enough to keep the ear engaged, and the long sentences generally remain clear despite high image density. At times, figurative language is nearly continuous, risking saturation and a slight softening of impact as images compete for attention. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum survive, and the closing images land cleanly and memorably.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, imagery is precise, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and thematic work at once). Metaphors are abundant but generally coherent within the celestial/creative lexicon; there are few, if any, mixed or clashing figures. Momentum holds despite the lyric density, with clear causal pivots (“Now the arch flared, and the instrument awoke…”). A touch of pruning in a couple of highly figurative runs could sharpen impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but highly controlled: most sentences do double duty for image and concept, and line rhythm supports the lullaby/ritual mood without sliding into monotony. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and thematically aligned (rails, waves, light, letters, seeds), with very few mixed or strained metaphors; “a stanza where the math can sing” is an example of successful compression. There is minimal redundancy or scaffold; beats advance either worldbuilding, emotional charge, or ritual progression. The final lines (“a small moon he can neither spend nor forgive”) land cleanly without figurative muddle, preserving the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally controlled: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and metaphors that are both original and internally coherent. The piece teaches a lush, metaphor-rich pattern early and sustains it without major muddle or mixed imagery; repetition (e.g., of metals and wind) is purposeful rather than looped. Syntax varies enough to keep cadence alive, and almost every sentence does more than one job (world-building plus theme plus character). The density of figurative language occasionally edges toward saturation, but not enough to obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and metaphor-rich, yet most lines pull double duty, advancing situation and atmosphere simultaneously (“an ascent the sea once taught the stone to remember”). Rhythm varies well, and there’s little true scaffolding or paraphrase looping; repeated motifs feel intentional and functional. A few metaphors flirt with saturation, but they rarely blur meaning or stall momentum, and sequence of action remains clear despite the lyric density. The final image (“stars on my card cool like shells in moonbread air”) lands crisply rather than getting lost in purple.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is dense and musical, with vivid metaphors that usually do double duty for setting and psychology (“panic once tuned itself to the pitch of trampling”). Sentence rhythms vary, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy despite the lyric register. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; it rarely muddles sense or obscures causality, and key beats (the bolt twist, the spoken refusal) are rendered with clarity. A few images flirt with over-richness, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is striking: most sentences do double duty for image and concept (“revising blood with footnotes,” “forgery ink sulked purple”) without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative density is very high but largely coherent; motifs recur instead of spawning new, unrelated metaphors. Rhythm supports the piece’s accumulative pressure, with a measured build toward the ledger scene and a quiet, reweighted close. The only minor limitation is that the lushness risks emotional coolness, but it doesn’t blur sense or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, theme, character) with little scaffolding, and rhythm varies without falling into mechanical patterns. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, with only rare edges of over-richness that do not impede clarity. There are no meaningful loops or synonym churn; each paragraph advances the accumulative pressure or deepens atmosphere. The final cadence is especially well-judged, recharging earlier phrases without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are varied, images often do double duty, and there is minimal scaffolding or repetition. The prose carries momentum despite its density, and figurative language is generally precise and thematically aligned rather than ornamental. A few metaphors push toward lushness, but they don’t blur causality or the closure image. Overall, information density and rhythm would pass in a top-tier venue with almost no line edits.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, character, theme) without redundancy, and figurative language is vivid yet coherent (“a middle music whose possibilities trembled like light in shallow water”). There are no noticeable scaffold sentences, synonym loops, or template cadences; the prose has momentum despite its density. Metaphoric consistency is high—plants, minerals, breath, and reconstruction recur in non-muddled ways that build texture rather than noise. The closing cadence is clean and earned, reusing earlier motifs (“During the reconstruction…”, parliament of plants, unsealing choice) without feeling repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is consistently high: images are fresh, multi-functional, and rarely feel strained, and nearly every sentence advances character, setting, or theme. The density of figurative language is high but pattern-consistent and legible, with minimal redundancy or scaffold. Syntax varies well, and the story’s cadences support its accumulative, lyric mode and its quiet climax. Any potential for “purple” is checked by precise, concrete anchors (e.g., “melted ridge of emulsion,” “spray swaggering higher than yesterday”) that keep the imagery grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, theme) and propel the piece forward without scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is abundant but rarely mixed or self-contradictory, and the metaphors (light as voice, tower as eyeball, knots as snarled vision) support the core conceit. Rhythm has good variation, with longer lush lines balanced by shorter clarifying beats at key turns (“It felt too simple, and yet the simple thing is often the true thing”). The density of imagery occasionally risks slight overload, but it does not materially obscure causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs, marrying worldbuilding, emotion, and concept without visible scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and coherent (“orchestra of halted crescendos,” “clock coughing sand”), with no significant mixed-metaphor muddle. There are no noticeable synonym loops or structural templates, and the closure image is sharp rather than blurred by purple prose. A demanding editor might trim one or two slightly lush turns, but momentum and clarity remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is lush and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but pattern-consistent—snow, lungs, breath, cables, silence—so it reads as deliberate design rather than purple excess. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences, and syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm alive. The only slight drawback is that the unrelenting metaphorical density may blur a tiny bit of edges for some readers, but it doesn’t materially obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is dense and multi-functional: images usually advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously (“his old map burning quietly until only the roads remain”). Figurative language is frequent but internally coherent; metaphors extend motifs (glass, heat, engraving, roots) rather than clashing. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase and no real syntactic monotony, despite the parallel structures. The only small reservation is that in a few low-pressure lines the metaphor density nudges toward decorative rather than necessary, but it never significantly muddies sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is excellent: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, with almost every image doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. There is some deliberate repetition (“by voicing silence,” “transliterates emotions”) that works more as motif than scaffolding. The main weakness is a mild tendency toward relentless metaphor—nearly every line is figurative—which can blur edges and slow micro-momentum in spots. Still, clarity at the climax and ending remains intact, and there are no significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level writing is rich, precise, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty (advancing action and theme together). A few metaphors push toward cleverness or ornament (“histogram wear a top hat”), but they do not obscure meaning or stall momentum. Syntax and paragraphing vary smoothly, and there’s no evident scaffolding, redundancy, or technical error. The density of imagery is very high, which edges toward purple at moments but remains mostly under control and purpose-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is muscular and economical for this lyrical density—most sentences do multiple jobs (image, world, emotion) and there’s little true scaffolding or synonym churn. Metaphors are vivid, mostly coherent (“velour thrown over a careless universe,” “the insect is a metronome that never met time”) and reinforce the central conceits. The rhythm varies enough to keep the piece propulsive, and the final lines land cleanly without muddle. The only knock is a sustained figurative saturation that, in places, could be fractionally pared back to let a few key images cut even deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are information-dense, multi-tasking atmosphere, character, and theme without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The prose is unabashedly metaphor-heavy, but the figurative logic remains coherent and rarely feels strained, and rhythm varies pleasantly. A minor deduction comes from the sheer density of imagery, which occasionally risks overshadowing clarity for a beat or two. Nonetheless, momentum and comprehension hold, and the final images land cleanly and memorably.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with little redundancy, and rhythm varies enough to keep the lyricism from feeling mechanical. Figurative language is dense but mostly precise and thematically cohesive (“minaret collapsed like a sigh that forgot its breath,” “sky is a peeled fruit”). There are no obvious scaffolds, loops, or syntactic templates, and causality remains clear despite the poetic mode. On the margin, a handful of metaphors could be trimmed to sharpen impact, but they do not materially obscure closure or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences have rhythmic variety, carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character), and avoid obvious loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically aligned, with very few mixed or strained metaphors; phrases like “cinnamon bronze, the scent of courage” feel earned in context. Momentum is good for a lyric piece—the story keeps advancing through images without stalling in static description. The main drawback is borderline excess: a few lines feel one metaphor too many, which in a prestige venue would likely invite minor trims for maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is notably strong: high information density, vivid yet controlled metaphors, and very little scaffolding or redundancy. The prose consistently does multiple jobs at once (world-building, emotion, theme) and keeps momentum despite its lyricism. A few phrases flirt with ornamental lushness, but they don’t muddy meaning or obscure causality, and no figurative muddle touches the closure beat. Syntax and punctuation are clean, varied, and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: dense yet purposeful metaphors, minimal redundancy, and strong verb choices maintain momentum in what is essentially a quiet, reflective narrative. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern-consistent (leaves, chords, rivers, breath), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple clutter. A few lines edge toward abstract statement, but they are brief and do not obscure cause/effect or dull the closing image. The final sentences land with clarity and cadence, recharging earlier motifs without resorting to summary.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: dense but usually precise imagery, minimal scaffolding, and sentences that almost always do multiple jobs (world-building, tone, and character in one move). Metaphor chains (“buttons like tiny moons,” “time breathes in jars,” “sand is a choir”) are largely coherent and thematically unified rather than showy detours. There is some risk of saturation—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or elevated phrase—which can slightly blunt impact in the climax. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the closing cadence (“does not end a future; … organizes it so it can begin”) crisply recharges the central conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and nearly all do double duty in advancing mood, character, or stakes. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise (“the sea below murmured like a kept secret,” “smiled like a bruise remembering its color”) and rarely tips into muddle. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum is maintained despite the lyricism. One could trim a metaphor or two without losing anything, but this sits comfortably in high-tier literary prose.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence-level craft is consistently strong: varied rhythms, clean syntax, and high information density with nearly every line advancing atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, largely drawing from a small, integrated pool of images (fog, river, cloth), avoiding mixed metaphors. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding; repetition (“percolate,” “spindrift serenity”) functions as motif rather than redundancy. The final cadence (“By the time the sun pressed through, the gutters were silent, and we had crossed”) neatly resolves both literal and figurative threads.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line by line, the prose is dense yet purposeful: most sentences carry atmosphere, world logic, and character simultaneously, with very little redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but internally consistent (light as braids, kindness as a kind of sun, place as phototropic), avoiding mixed metaphors or overblown ornament. Rhythm varies well, with long sinuous lines balanced by shorter, anchoring statements, and the final cadence lands decisively without over-explaining. I see no loops, clarity breaks, or register slips that dull the closure image; the density feels intentional rather than indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: nearly every sentence carries more than one job (image, character, and theme) and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony despite the lyric mode. Figurative language is dense, but it largely stays coherent and grounded in the story’s water/light mechanics (“a quivering hush made of glass breath,” “a far buoy counting its breaths”). There are a few spots where metaphors stack close together, flirting with over-richness, yet they do not obscure causality or the closure image. No noticeable scaffolding, loops, or syntactic templates undercut momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (world-building, interiority, and theme) with few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Figurative language is rich but not incoherent; motifs of tide, stone, light, and hum remain consistent and avoid mixed metaphors. Syntax and paragraphing are varied, supporting a steady forward momentum despite the reflective mode. The density approaches purple at times, yet clarity and closure remain intact, so any excess feels like a stylistic choice rather than an artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (image, character, theme) with minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is dense but coherent and carefully curated—“dragonflies stitch the edges,” “a geometry of patience,” “a ripple shaped like a thread”—with no mixed metaphors that blur meaning. Syntax varies naturally, and paragraphs all shift knowledge or charge; there’s no dead weight or obvious synonym churn. The final lines elegantly braid earlier motifs without overstatement, leaving a clear, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is highly polished: images are fresh, multi-functional, and rarely redundant (“like finding a river under floorboards” both conveys sensation and thematic discovery). Sentences do more than one job, weaving atmosphere, character, and stakes without padding, and the rhythm moves cleanly from accumulation to focused action in the climax. Figurative density is high but controlled; metaphors feel of a piece with the narrator’s mind and the radio context, avoiding mixed or strained vehicles. There are virtually no scaffold/loop artifacts or clarity lapses, though a couple of thesis-like sentences slightly dampen the rawness of otherwise exquisite phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, densely imagistic, and generally multi-functional, advancing atmosphere, character, and concept at once. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with few if any mixed or confusing metaphors; “the vault pressed close above me like a hand on a mouth” is vivid and precise. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and momentum holds despite the lyric mode. The only constraint on an even higher score is that the consistent richness occasionally edges toward uniform texture, giving fewer sharp rhythmic contrasts.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, often doing triple duty (advancing setting, character, and theme simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and pattern-consistent, rarely tipping into muddle; images like the ribbon as “a nerve, both tether and wound” are precise and integrative. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase-looping, and momentum holds despite lyric density. A very slight risk of over-richness remains, but it does not blur causality or the closure image, which lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphor use is frequent but largely coherent and fresh, and the piece avoids mixed images that would blur sense. A demanding editor might question whether the unbroken intensity of figurative language risks slight saturation in spots, but clarity and momentum are preserved throughout. Opening and ending lines are especially strong, bookending the piece with charged, memorable images.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences typically do multiple jobs (image, mood, theme, and movement) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The metaphor density is high but mostly coherent and thematically aligned, with only occasional risk of saturation or near-ornamental flourish. Syntax varies well, and there are no grammatical slips or clarity failures that impede cause and effect. The final lines in particular land cleanly and musically, reactivating earlier motifs without over-explaining them.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, varied syntax, and images that generally carry multiple loads (father/loot/territory; bills as saints and borders). Metaphors are daring but controlled; “quiet is a currency that buys its own loneliness” and “board joined the exodus we once orchestrated” are exemplary of compression without muddle. There are no real loops or scaffolding sentences, and the rhythm between long, sinuous lines and shorter pivots is well-judged. A slight tendency toward sustained ornateness across the whole piece, rather than modulating intensity more, is the only limiter.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are varied in rhythm, densely informative, and often do double or triple duty in setting, character, and theme (“We rewrote our algorithm so the timing weights matched grief, and the stone sentences started to sing back”). Figurative language is rich but mostly coherent and thematically aligned with breath, light, and stone; the repetitions of breath and witnessing function as deliberate pattern rather than scaffolding. There are a few metaphors that skate close to overwrought (“wet stone turning into wheat,” “a drum remembering a lullaby”), and the density of imagery is very high, which risks saturation in places. Still, clarity and momentum are maintained, and there are no real artifacts, loops, or syntactic tics dragging the prose down.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is richly imagistic yet generally precise: metaphors are coherent and purposeful (“apples bump the shore like helmets stacked after drill,” “a pouch that murmurs”). Sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character—without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and rhythm varies effectively. A few lines verge on purple (“thirsts for skin and secrecy alike,” “slow as a moon gaining”) but they still serve theme and tone rather than obscuring sense. Line-level craft fully supports closure; any trimming would target density rather than clarity repairs.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is lush yet mostly precise, with many sentences doing triple duty (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) and very little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Metaphors are generally coherent and grounded in the story’s logic (roots, scars, mazes, eclipses), and rhythm varies enough to avoid a mechanical drumbeat. There is some risk of overload—almost every line carries figurative weight—which slightly blurs a few beats and keeps the emotional spikes from standing out as sharply as they might. Still, clarity and momentum never collapse, and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is highly controlled, dense with metaphor yet generally precise and multi-functional, advancing atmosphere, world, and character simultaneously (e.g., “making hollows into harbors”). Rhythm varies, and there is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every sentence earns its place. However, figurative language appears in almost every line, creating a constant intensity that can risk saturation and leave fewer moments of simple, clarifying language. That uniform lushness—not any single muddled metaphor—slightly tempers momentum and prevents this from feeling flawless at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly compressed and image-rich, with most sentences doing double duty for setting, character, and theme—e.g., the cloth “pinned like a moth losing its color” both visualizes and thematizes fading sound. Metaphors are generally coherent and non-redundant; sound, medicine, and geology form a tight figurative palette that supports the core concept. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the line-level rhythm modulates well, tightening around key realizations then easing into the closing image. A few stacked similes risk density but do not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is outstanding: sentences are varied in length and structure, dense with meaning, and almost always doing multiple jobs (world-building, interiority, and theme). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with a coherent magnetic/ceramic/orchard motif that avoids mixed-metaphor sludge; images like “sky ring like fired clay” are both fresh and legible. There is minimal scaffold or paraphrase looping, and no artifacts that obscure action or closure. The prose sustains high lyric intensity without tipping into opacity or purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is striking: sentences are information-dense, metaphorically rich, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. The figurative language is frequent but pattern-consistent and supports the piece’s lyric mode rather than obscuring sense; images like “drift tags of hammered tin” and “moths became numbers… then advice” land cleanly. Rhythm varies well enough to avoid monotony, and the final lines resolve with a precise, uncluttered cadence. A handful of metaphors skate close to saturation, but they don’t materially blur causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is dense and musical, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (e.g., “edges to invitations,” “a bell too wise for ringing”). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and legible, and there’s little in the way of scaffold or paraphrase loops. A demanding editor might question whether the relentless metaphorical richness slightly dulls momentum in a couple of mid-story lines, but clarity at closure remains intact. Overall, the prose is near-publication-ready with minimal trimming.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is densely figurative yet mostly precise and multi-tasking, with images doing character, atmosphere, and thematic work simultaneously (culvert as “tired lung,” tracks as “dragon teeth,” accordion as “stitched animal determined to live”). Rhythm varies effectively across beats, with longer, image-rich sentences interspersed with shorter declarative lines at key turns (“The simplest story is the one I refused for years”). There is a slight risk of over-saturation—almost every line carries metaphor—but coherence and momentum remain intact, and there are no significant loops or scaffolding sentences. Syntax and punctuation are clean, and the final line resonates without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are precise, rhythmically varied, and densely informative, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Repetition of motifs (“fog,” “delays,” “veiled”) reads as deliberate patterning rather than synonym churn, and there are no obvious scaffolding sentences or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and well-aligned with the story’s conceptual spine, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple overload. A handful of lines lean toward conceptual phrasing over image, but they don’t materially drag momentum or obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line by line, the prose is highly controlled: images are fresh, sentence rhythm varied, and almost every line does double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and non-redundant (“mulberry ache,” “brown galaxies,” “velvet observatory”) with no major mixed metaphors. There is a slight saturation of metaphor that occasionally edges toward lushness for such a high-pressure decision, but it does not blur causality or the closure image. There are no evident scaffolds, loops, or copy-level slips.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, musical, and information-dense, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors (aurora as lungs, light as spores, stone “listening back”) are original and coherent, rarely mixed or overwrought. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum is steady despite the lyric density. A slight tendency toward piling figurative language in successive lines brushes against purple, but clarity and the closure image remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentence-level craft is excellent: rhythms vary, images are fresh (“clouds lean like sheep against the cliff, browsing light from the edges”), and almost every line does multiple jobs (setting, theme, character). Figurative density is high but controlled; metaphors stay within the established palette of vines, weather, tools, and forgiveness, avoiding muddle. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding sentences, or clarity issues; the prose maintains momentum despite its meditative nature. The final paragraphs land with clean, charged images rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty as scene, mood, and theme; there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase-looping. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and patterned, avoiding mixed metaphors that would muddy sense, and the syntax varies enough to keep auditory interest. A few lines flirt with over-richness (“campfire answer from memory, embers clicking”) but remain legible and tonally consistent with the established lyricism. Momentum is appropriately gentle for this kind of story and never stalls into decorative description.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, mood) with few redundancies, and rhythm varies in a way that matches the trance-like pacing. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; images like “the stars felt inside my ribs” and “unwrinkled paper that once carried maps” are clear and apt. There are no significant loops or scaffold sentences, and syntax remains clean and comprehensible despite the lyric mode. The only constraint on an even higher score is that the sheer density of metaphor occasionally risks softening immediacy and pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is densely figurative but pattern-taught from the first line and remains coherent; images extend rather than contradict each other (ledger/liturgy/accounting, bone/echo/text). Sentences are varied in length and rhythm, and nearly every line does multiple jobs—advancing the ritual, clarifying stakes, and enriching atmosphere—without obvious scaffold or paraphrase loops. Crucial beats (boundary of forgetting, pulse’s reintegration, final stasis) are rendered concretely in action and image rather than summarized. Despite the high metaphor density, clarity of cause/effect and closure remains intact, and there are no mixed-metaphor stumbles that dull the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is finely wrought, with high information density and very few, if any, scaffolding or redundant lines; nearly every sentence advances character, world, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, with images like “a light that remembered light after light had gone” doing real conceptual work. There is a mild risk of over-saturation—so many metaphors per paragraph that airflow and contrast are slightly reduced—but not to the point of obscuring clarity or closure. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep momentum despite the lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (setting, mood, character, theme) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. The figurative language is abundant but mostly precise and coherent, with very few strained images; rhythm and sentence variety keep the piece from bogging. Momentum holds despite the lyric density, and there are no significant loops or muddled metaphors that obscure causality or closure. The sheer saturation of imagery occasionally skirts purple, which slightly tempers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is dense and purposeful: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and the metaphoric web (amber, honey, static, bells) is coherent rather than muddled. Rhythm varies, with sentence and paragraph length supporting the contemplative but forward-moving feel of the ritual. There is an almost unbroken run of figurative language, which edges toward ornate but remains intelligible and rarely feels like decorative churn. A touch more spareness at one or two key stress points could sharpen impact, but the prose is already well above typical publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is consistently high, with dense, multi-function sentences that advance setting, emotion, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled, with few if any mixed metaphors, and repetition (“through scattered light,” the echo motif) feels patterned rather than accidental. A demanding editor might trim a handful of slightly redundant or equivalently lush sentences to sharpen momentum. Overall, the prose is polished and musical without materially obscuring clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, musical, and information-dense; nearly every sentence advances image, character, or theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and well-matched to the world (threads, seams, sleep, tides), with no mixed metaphors blurring sense; repetitions (drops, cracks, lukewarm) are pattern, not scaffold. There are no evident loops, filler, or syntactic monotony; the piece reads cleanly aloud and supports its lyric ambitions without obscuring action or stakes. A slight saturation of poetic turns in mid-scene keeps it just under the absolute top tier, but the craft is publishable as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in length and structure, images are precise, and figurative language is controlled rather than piled. Most lines do multiple jobs at once—advancing action, revealing character, and thickening atmosphere—without redundancy or scaffolding. There are no noticeable loops, mixed metaphors, or register slips, even in the high-pressure closing beats. The final sentences land cleanly and musically, reactivating earlier motifs with clarity rather than blur.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense yet generally precise: most metaphors are clean, layered, and doing multiple jobs (world-building, interiority, and theme). There’s strong information density with minimal scaffolding; nearly every line advances atmosphere or character conflict. The risk of over-saturation is felt—figurative language is frequent—but rhythm and clarity are maintained, and mixed metaphors are avoided. A slightly leaner line in a few spots might sharpen impact further, but the craft comfortably meets high-level literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence-level craft is precise and information-dense; most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character without redundancy or slack. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent with the established metaphor field (breath, rhythm, trees as anatomy, trust as systems), and there are no mixed metaphors that obscure action. Momentum is maintained even through reflective lines, which are brief and pressure-aware, and the crisis itself is fully dramatized rather than summarized. Minor potential for trimming exists in a couple of aphoristic sentences, but they don’t materially slow or muddy the climax or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is dense and musical, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, emotion) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is abundant but internally coherent and motive-driven, with extended metaphors (courts, seeds, opposites) developed rather than stacked haphazardly. Momentum holds across the piece; no paragraph reads as expendable, and the closure image (“chimes kept time with a human beat”) lands cleanly. At times the sustained metaphorical richness slightly risks saturation, but it never seriously obscures cause/effect or emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is tight and musically varied, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, mood, interiority) without obvious scaffolding. Metaphoric density is high but largely coherent and pattern-driven (weather, breath, flow, hush), so it reads as deliberate lyricism rather than purple drift. A few constructions risk redundancy or self-consciousness (“across the hush of a possibility just born” appears twice conceptually; “storm-born silence” recurs), slightly blurring impact. Still, clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout, and no major artifacts or loops dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences are varied, dense, and multitask, with very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is abundant but controlled and coherent, with few if any mixed metaphors; the “urgency tastes like rain” and “candle relighting itself between drafts” images, for instance, are vivid without muddling sense. A demanding editor might trim one or two slightly over-rich phrases, but they do not drag momentum or obscure causality. The final image lands cleanly and powerfully, with no textual artifacts dulling it.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but purposeful; most sentences do at least two jobs (world-building plus theme, or image plus emotional shading). Figurative language is frequent yet remarkably consistent in imagery (ice, light boundaries, breath, pages), avoiding mixed metaphors or muddle. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum in a largely contemplative piece. A few metaphors verge on ornamental, but they do not obscure causality or blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs, rhythm varies, and figurative language is inventive and generally coherent (“the crack sounded like a sermon ending,” “the clock's hands twitching like hooked fish”). There is occasional risk of over-saturation—nearly every sentence bears a metaphor, and a few (“kept shame from growing mold”) flirt with excess—but clarity and momentum remain intact. No major loops, scaffolding, or syntactic artifacts blunt the closure image; the final paragraphs land cleanly. Tightening 5–10% of the densest metaphors would lift this to truly top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is tightly controlled: sentences are varied, information-dense, and almost every line pulls double duty for image and concept. Extended metaphors (“wind writes in loose wire,” “a tone that sounded like breath held by a planet”) are fresh and largely non-redundant, maintaining clarity even in peak beats. There is some risk of over-saturation—many sentences are figurative—but it does not materially impede comprehension or dull the closure image. No obvious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic templates appear, and the final lines land with clean, memorable cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-by-line, the prose is strong, with high information density and images that usually do double duty for atmosphere and theme (“I keep an empty hourglass in my pocket to listen to the stillness between grains that are no longer there”). The rhythmic control is good, and there are few if any true redundancies or scaffold sentences. There is a mild risk of over-saturation in the metaphor field—nearly every sentence in some stretches carries an image—which can blur individual impacts. Still, the figurative net holds together conceptually, and clarity at the climax and closure is never compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are precise, layered, and rarely redundant, with many sentences doing double duty for mood, theme, and character (“carrying silence like a chair, ordinary and heavy”). Syntax and paragraphing create a pleasing, legible rhythm; the piece reads aloud smoothly despite its density. There is some risk of figurative saturation—nearly every line carries an image—which may slightly blunt impact in spots, but coherence and clarity are maintained. No significant scaffolding, loops, or grammatical slips appear, and the closure image is sharp and un-muddied.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious redundancy, and the figurative language is rich yet coherent with the setting (“the sea turned cathedral,” “where refractions knife”). There is a high density of metaphor, but it rarely slips into mixed images or stalls momentum; syntactic variety maintains flow. Expository compressions (“We practice for weeks…”) are efficient and earned. I see no significant loops, scaffolding, or generation artifacts that blur causality or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in rhythm, most carry multiple functions (image, theme, and motion), and there’s no real paraphrase looping or syntactic monotony. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and internally coherent, with recurring images of breath, rain, and hush instead of scattershot metaphors. The piece maintains momentum despite its lyric density; even overtly crafted lines still advance situation or emotional charge. A handful of formulations glance close to epigram (“Shame eats sound”) but they’re sharpened enough by context to avoid feeling like detachable quotes.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, varied in length, and information-dense, often doing atmospheric, thematic, and character work at once. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent with the sea/tech/body motifs; images like the walkway as a “secret tongue” feel apt. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum is maintained despite the lyric density. The prose occasionally skirts the edge of overload, but clarity and closure remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is dense and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double or triple duty in atmosphere, character, and concept (“The file says deceased, but the breath fogging tonight's eyepiece says otherwise”). Syntax varies and the rhythm supports the meditative, accumulative drive without major scaffolding or redundancy. However, figurative language appears in nearly every line, occasionally risking saturation and slight blur (“a mug…shatters on the star chart like fragile weather” plus several similar similes in quick succession). This high-density metaphor field is mostly coherent but just crowded enough to slightly dull the sharpness of a few key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level work is dense but controlled; metaphors are fresh and thematically aligned (e.g., “cracks are libraries,” “nouns that had gone feral”) without collapsing into muddle. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, giving the piece momentum despite its lyric mode. Almost every line does double duty—worldbuilding, character, and theme—without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The density of figurative language is high, but patterns are consistent and legible, and the closure image is sharp, not blurred by purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is precise and musical, with metaphors that are unusual yet coherent within a tight field (gravity, ice, song, seeds, radio/static). Sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, emotion, and motion—without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and the prose sustains momentum despite being image-rich. Crucial beats (“I pressed the arrowhead to my tongue… and let the stupidest pun lick free”) are clear and uncluttered, allowing impact. A few moments verge on density for its own sake, but they don’t obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is lush but remarkably clean: images are inventive yet usually coherent (“teeth of iron confessing soil,” “seedpod applause”) and avoid mixed metaphors that would muddy sense. Information density is high with minimal scaffolding; almost every sentence adds atmosphere, theme, or motion. There is a risk of figurative saturation, but the pattern is taught early and sustained, so it reads as deliberate style rather than purple excess. A few abstractions (“where breath remembers the body”) flirt with vagueness, but they do not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but remarkably clean: metaphors are fresh and largely non-competing, and nearly every sentence advances character, world, or theme. There is minimal scaffold or paraphrase looping; key images recur with new weight instead of simple repetition. One could argue the figurative load is high throughout, yet rhythm and clarity hold, especially in pivotal beats like the storm release and the vigil’s growth. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive venues, with only a slight risk of overload for readers less tolerant of sustained lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is lush and mostly precise, with high information density—many sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character). Figurative language is frequent but coherent, with few strained or mixed metaphors, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, flowing lines and tighter, declarative ones at structural pivots. The sheer density of imagery edges toward excess in places, which for a top-tier venue might invite a light trim for breath and contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is highly controlled: almost every sentence does double duty in image and concept, and the rhythm supports the quietly escalating strangeness. Figurative density is very high but impressively coherent—hyperbolic geometry, lungs, weather, and analog memory all interlock without mixed-metaphor muddle. There is minimal scaffold or redundancy; information advances with each line, and the closing image of books becoming “precisely heavier” elegantly recharges earlier motifs. The main constraint is that the sheer richness of metaphor in nearly every sentence edges toward over-saturation, which may slightly blur sharpness for some readers.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences do double or triple duty—world-building, mood, and character—without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Metaphors (“like a knot remembering it is ribbon,” “a candle feels a window”) are original and internally coherent, and rhythm supports the accumulative pressure toward dawn and gallery. There is a high density of figurative language, but it feels patterned and voice-motivated rather than purple, and clarity of action never breaks. Trimming a small handful of metaphors in the midsection could sharpen momentum further, but the prose is already publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is lush and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs (world, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Metaphors are frequent but controlled and coherent with the established logic of the piece; there are no mixed or contradictory images at key beats. A few phrases (“hush of cosmic possibility,” “lantern in slow breath”) skate close to purple, but they don’t obscure action or closure. Rhythm and paragraphing maintain momentum in what is essentially a ritual scene.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush but purposeful: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, interiority, theme) without redundancy, and the figurative language is coherent and well-chosen (“crisp nostalgia cuts the water like peppermint” is exemplary). There are no obvious loops, template cadences, or filter stacks; grammar and sequencing remain clean. Metaphors stay within the piece’s established logic of sea, orchard, and folklore, avoiding mixed or strained comparisons. The only minor reservation is that figurative density is nearly continuous, and a touch more spareness around the climactic correction might increase impact.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is dense and inventive, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once (“Dust rose when I breathed, as if even air preferred to be archived before it touched me”). Metaphors are original yet coherent, rarely feeling mixed or gratuitous despite their frequency. A case could be made that the figurative saturation edges toward excess, but it does not materially impede clarity or momentum. Syntax and punctuation are clean, and the final lines land with sharp, economical resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush yet largely disciplined: most metaphors are coherent and additive (“branches speak in hues the throat cannot carry,” “bees stitched with shadow thread”), and nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, world, or motion. Information density is high, with images doing thematic and narrative work simultaneously. There is some proximity to purple prose due to the relentless figurative texture and similar tonal register across beats, but clarity remains intact and closure is sharp. Trimming a few redundant radiances/hushes would sharpen momentum without sacrificing beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are varied and musical, with images that generally cohere and do multiple jobs (world, mood, and theme at once). The density of metaphor flirts with excess but remains controlled; key beats (“The first knot undoes like a breath released, and the sanctuary tilts to listen”) are clear rather than muddled. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase-looping, and the syntax carries momentum through a mostly internal, ritualistic sequence. Minor tightening could further heighten impact, but nothing here significantly obscures sense or dulls closure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is finely crafted, with high information density and striking yet coherent figurative language (“stones like worn teeth in a careful mouth”; “as if rain had been arguing with the past”). Sentence rhythms vary and generally sustain momentum rather than bogging down, despite the lyric density. Overwriting is kept in check by consistent image families and by tying metaphors to character perspective; there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The only minor limitation is that nearly every line carries a metaphor, which risks saturating the ear in places but never quite tips into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is excellent: images are fresh, metaphors coherent, and most sentences do multiple jobs (world, emotion, theme) without padding. Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous reflections and shorter declarative beats, especially around the tape decoding and final ascent. Figurative density is high but pattern-consistent and does not slip into muddle or redundancy; there are no real loops or scaffolding sentences. The only restraint is that a few formulations (“physics of letting go,” “first name basis with death”) recur just enough to feel a touch curated rather than entirely organic.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is densely figurative yet highly controlled, with most metaphors reinforcing the central workshop/ circuitry/ghost-listening conceit rather than competing; phrases like “faces braided from audit trails, chat logs, and ticket histories” are both vivid and conceptually precise. Sentence rhythm and paragraphing carry momentum through what is essentially one extended beat, avoiding paraphrase loops or scaffoldy repetition. A few lines flirt with saturation, but the story clearly teaches its lyric pattern early and sustains it with purpose, so the density reads as style rather than bloat. Grammar and sequencing remain clean, and the final lines land crisply without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is polished and mostly economical, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology (“I felt the guilty tremor a string feels when plucked by a ghost…”). Figurative language is frequent but largely fresh and internally coherent; few metaphors feel mixed or gratuitous. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax varies enough to maintain forward momentum despite reflective density. The only constraint on a higher score is that the persistent high-lyric register slightly risks saturation in the midsection without always adding new nuance to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense with imagery, but the metaphors are coherent and purposeful, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“quietly explosive” hush, “negative monument,” “dim braille against the Milky Way”). There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; almost every line adds a new facet to character, setting, or theme. Despite the lyrical intensity, syntax remains clear and action-order intelligible—especially around the central act of tying the line to the absence. If anything, the richness pushes the upper edge of acceptable lushness, but it never obscures causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or thematic patterning without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative density is high but controlled; images cluster around a few coherent domains (sky, breath, wood, pollen, cracks) rather than spinning into mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates well—shorter sentences around sirens and cranes, longer accumulative ones in contemplative moments—keeping momentum despite the lyric focus. There are no clear syntactic loops or artifacts that blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is strong: high information density, purposeful metaphors, and almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops; most sentences do at least two jobs. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with images that tend to be coherent and additive rather than muddled. The prose sustains a lyrical register without tipping into opacity or exhausting the reader, and the opening and closing lines are particularly well-judged. A few lines verge on ornament for ornament’s sake, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur causality.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, varied in rhythm, and densely informative without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent, rarely mixed or self-contradictory, and often does double duty for worldbuilding and emotional state (“the seal sighed, a sound like a harbor falling asleep”). Momentum is gentle but steady, with each paragraph adding a new facet rather than circling. The one arguable weakness is sheer density—nearly every sentence is metaphor-laden—which may slightly blur edges for some readers, but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density, varied syntax, and many images doing double duty for setting and emotion (“a moth landing on a drum,” “the sky unbuttoned”). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, creating a consistent, dreamy texture rather than purple clutter. A few metaphors verge on ornate stacking, which slightly risks saturation but does not obscure causality or closure. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the final sentences land cleanly and musically.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences do multiple jobs (world, emotion, theme) with high information density and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern-driven (sea as teacher, puppetry and performance, hush and sound), avoiding mixed or confusing metaphors. Rhythm varies organically between long, sinuous constructions and shorter beats at key moments; the closure image lands clearly and cleanly. If anything, a couple of metaphors (“has the shape of a bell and the taste of salt”) flirt with excess, but they don’t impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is exceptionally controlled: dense with imagery yet rarely redundant, each metaphor doing real work for mood, worldbuilding, or character (“penny bright mourning,” “maps the curse would grow”). Rhythm varies naturally between longer, sinuous lines and shorter, decisive beats at moments of action. Figurative language is frequent but coherent; no mixed metaphors or scaffolding loops measurably dull clarity or momentum. The final paragraph in particular is lean and potent, reusing earlier motifs (nut, blueprint, graceless beauty) without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but controlled: most sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, theme) without collapsing into muddle. Figurative language is frequent yet patterned and thematically coherent (music, polymers, water, metamorphosis), with very few mixed or strained metaphors. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every line advances mood, character, or conceptual tension, and the closing images are clear and resonant. One could argue the lushness might be slightly heavy for some tastes, but it does not obscure causality or dull the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is tight and musical, with high information density—most sentences advance both image and idea. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined; metaphors are internally consistent and reinforce a small, coherent set of images (glass, light, clouds, ledgers). There are no real loops or scaffolding phrases, and syntax is varied enough to keep momentum in a reflective piece. The only restraint is that the consistently lush register risks slight saturation, but it does not impede clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, tight, and multitasking, with many images doing atmospheric, thematic, and character work at once (“making little mirrors someone could drown inside without water”). Figurative language is abundant but mostly coherent and internally consistent—weather, salt, organs, and architecture form a stable metaphor web. There’s very little scaffolding or paraphrase; almost every line advances mood or meaning, and the final cadence (“stayed sturdy brittle”) lands cleanly. A few metaphors (“a heresy of ocean trapped in thirst”) risk feeling ornamental rather than strictly necessary, but they do not obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, few if any redundant scaffolding sentences, and metaphors that typically align and reinforce one another (“siloed organ,” “voices shelved like constellations”). The rhythm on the page supports the accumulative drive, especially in the middle where repeated structures echo choral patterns without devolving into loops. The prose does ride close to purple in places due to sheer figurative volume, but coherence is maintained and the closure image remains sharp. There are no noticeable syntactic or grammatical slips, and each paragraph adds new pressure or texture.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and lines that often do multiple jobs (world, psyche, and theme) without obvious scaffolding. Metaphor density is high but mostly coherent and on-theme, and rhythm varies enough to avoid mechanical cadence. There is some repetition of coined phrases and conceptual restatement (“helix-minded,” “chaotically precise,” fossils) that could be trimmed for even sharper momentum. Nothing at the line level obscures cause/effect or dulls the closure image, but slight overrichness keeps it just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is richly figurative and information-dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and interiority) without obvious slack. Metaphoric density approaches the edge of excess but remains coherent and legible; images rarely clash or confuse action. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and syntax varies enough to avoid a drumbeat cadence. A slightly more varied ratio of plain to ornate sentences could sharpen momentum further, but line-level control is already at a high literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is excellent: high information density, nearly every sentence does multiple jobs (image, theme, character) with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is abundant yet coherent and patterned—organs, grammar, breath, memory—without mixed metaphors or muddle. There are a couple of near-repetitive thematic statements, but they modulate rather than loop and do not blunt the closure. Rhythm on the page supports the “intensely quiet” tone, and the final sentences land cleanly without purple overrun.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, purposeful, and often do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme braided into a single image). Figurative language is inventive and rarely clichéd, and there are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic templates. The prose does risk purple in places (metaphor stacked on metaphor, nearly every sentence carrying high-lyric weight), which can create a uniform texture that marginally reduces momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is preserved throughout, and both opening and closing lines land with precision and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush and metaphor-dense but largely precise and controlled; images like “choir of broken clocks” and “lanterns hang like arguments waiting their turn” are fresh and legible. Sentences rarely loop or paraphrase; each new metaphor tends to add a facet rather than restate, and momentum is maintained despite the lyric mode. There is a mild risk of saturation—almost every sentence carries figurative weight—which could be trimmed slightly for maximal sharpness, but clarity of action and closure never suffers. Line-level rhythm supports the accumulative drive, breathing more as the clasp opens and the fireworks begin.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent: high information density, purposeful metaphors, and almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism, and key images (the seed “light as a lie,” smell as “cathedral of odor,” patience as spiral) are memorable and precise. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, which edges toward over-richness and slightly blurs a few conceptual phrases (“turning of the tide’s thought”) through repetition. A bit more sparseness in select moments would let the strongest images stand out even more.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, musical, and information-dense; images typically do double or triple duty for worldbuilding, emotion, and theme (“sound pools there… and the pulse to seeds”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with very few mixed or redundant metaphors and no real loops or scaffolding bloat. Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous sentences and shorter punches at key turns (“The shard slides home; the chamber tightens; the river lurches…”). It’s very nearly publication-ready on a sentence level, needing only the lightest edit for taste rather than clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: sentences are information-dense, metaphor is mostly coherent and purposeful, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym churn. Recurrent images (lungs, breath, silence, gusts) evolve rather than repeat mechanically, and each paragraph moves knowledge or emotional charge forward. The prose edges toward density, but it rarely tips into purple or obscures causality. A touch more variation in figurative mode—occasionally letting a plain sentence stand—would give the lyrical passages even more impact.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level writing is dense but impressively controlled: images are fresh, precise, and rarely feel redundant, and nearly every sentence does multiple kinds of work (worldbuilding, emotion, theme). Figurative language is frequent yet coherent; recurrences like breath, ribs, veins, glass, and color form a deliberate pattern rather than a muddle. There are no meaningful loops or scaffolding phrases, and the syntax varies enough to keep momentum. The only restraint on a higher score is that the prose is so richly figurative in nearly every line that a touch more spareness at pressure peaks could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is strong: almost every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and patterned (seams, weaving, looms, echoes) rather than random ornament; “avalanchingly quiet” and the loom metaphor are memorable without muddling sense. Syntax is varied, transitions are clean, and there are no noticeable loops, mixed metaphors, or copy errors that blunt closure. The density of imagery flirts with overrichness in places but never quite tips into opacity or drag.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is very dense with metaphor, yet the images remain coherent and structurally relevant (press mechanics, celestial dimming, mathematical language), avoiding the mush of mixed or decorative similes. Almost every sentence carries double duty—worldbuilding, emotional state, and thematic work—and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Cadence is musically varied, and crucial beats (“When the lever dropped, our senses sheared…”) land with clarity and force. It is maximalist but disciplined, which is rare at this density.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, emotion, theme) with very little scaffolding or redundancy. The figurative language is dense yet controlled and coherent—metaphors around instruments, seeds, and memory interlock instead of tangling. Rhythm on the page is varied and musical, and there are no noticeable loops, template cadences, or clarity breaks, including at closure. Almost every line earns its place in terms of momentum or resonance, which is rare at this density.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush but largely precise; most metaphors are coherent and do double duty for mood and meaning (“a room after laughter leaves,” “a gate made of winter accepting a key”). Information density is high, with almost every sentence adding atmosphere and/or character movement; there is little true scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few lines verge on ornate abstraction (“field of truthful lies,” “careful approval of cooling metal”) yet they remain intelligible and contextually justified. Line-level rhythm supports the accumulative hush rather than bogging it down, keeping momentum intact for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is dense and generally excellent, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphor and personification are frequent but mostly coherent and thematically unified around weaving, silence, and distance. There’s a mild risk of saturation in places (“raveling silence,” “time’s unraveling tapestry”) that could be pared for even more impact, but clarity and momentum remain intact. No major artifacts or loops undermine the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) with minimal scaffolding, and the rhythm varies effectively. Imagery is consistently fresh yet coherent with the world’s logic (“gears sunk in dust like thoughtful turtles”; “powder drift fell like white moths disturbed from sleep”). Figurative density is high but controlled; it rarely clogs momentum or obscures action. Minor repetition of key phrases feels motif-driven rather than like synonym churn, and there are no notable clarity lapses.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are purposeful and multi-functional, with very few redundancies, and figurative language is inventive yet mostly coherent with the sensory-map premise. The cadence shifts appropriately with pressure, and there are no obvious scaffold lines or synonym loops; nearly every sentence carries world, character, and theme simultaneously. The prose occasionally skirts purple—there are many metaphors per page—but they are internally consistent and do not obscure action or stakes. Overall, the piece would require minimal line-editing for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is tightly wrought, with high information density—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, and theme at once. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent; images of light, breath, and water recur with purpose rather than decorative churn. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors, and the final image (“glowed with a luminescent ache”) lands cleanly. The only restraint from an even higher score is that the lyric texture is fairly uniform, with few abrupt rhythmic gear-shifts under emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is dense and musical, with many sentences doing double or triple duty in image, worldbuilding, and theme (“In our family, laughter was the oil, and storms were gears…”). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and pattern-taught early; metaphors advance sense instead of obscuring it. There is little scaffolding or redundancy, and the syntax varies enough to keep momentum in a highly descriptive mode. The only minor reservation is that the unrelenting metaphorical richness risks saturation for some readers during high-pressure beats, even though clarity is never lost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density and multi-functioning metaphors—images typically advance setting, theme, and emotion simultaneously. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, sinuous sentences and shorter, declarative ones (“A lantern insists; a lens receives”), giving the piece oral-musical quality. There is some risk of over-saturation—nearly every sentence contains figurative language—which can slightly blur edges for a reader who craves a few plainer anchor lines. However, clarity of action and emotional through-line stays intact, and there are no significant scaffolding, loops, or muddled metaphors to drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is densely figurative yet remarkably clear; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, theme) without redundancy. There are no obvious scaffolds, loops, or mixed metaphors, and the closure image—pin as “soft star on the stone”—lands cleanly. The main tradeoff is intensity: figurative language saturates nearly every line, which may slightly blunt contrast and propulsion for some readers. Still, by demanding-editor standards this is high-tier, nearly submission-ready prose.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is richly imagistic with high information density; most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme) without clear redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphor use is frequent but largely coherent and grounded in a small, consistent palette (glass, threads, dawn, roots), avoiding mixed or strained images. There is a risk of saturation—nearly every sentence is figurative—but clarity at key beats (mica loosening, weaving, sky changing) remains intact. A touch more plainness around the climactic action could heighten force, but at this length it remains publishably controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and often do double-duty in characterization and theme (“paper…accepted her lines the way shore clay accepts a footprint”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and coherent; it forms a consistent texture instead of scattered ornaments. There is little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony, and the final lines land with clarity and rhythm. The only constraint is that the density of metaphor occasionally edges toward lushness that slightly blurs emphasis, keeping it just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, often doing triple duty (world-building, character, and theme) without obvious scaffolding. Repeated syntactic and lexical patterns (“We…” openings, motif callbacks) read as deliberate rhythm rather than accidental loops, and figurative language is consistent and sensorial (“dawn lights once braided the street,” “steam rises like a map of lanes”). A few phrases verge on overpacked abstraction (“heuristically gentle,” “tiny flags of patience”), and the density could be marginally trimmed for sharpness, but clarity and momentum remain intact. Crucially, the closure beats are crisp and unfogged by purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush but remarkably controlled: metaphors are coherent within a tight ice/light/vow lexicon, and most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and concept. Information density is high with minimal scaffolding or repetition; there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or filler lines. A handful of phrases (“lamps hum-laughed,” “clean blank of survival”) flirt with overrichness but remain legible and tonally in-step. Overall, line-level craft would be competitive in top venues, with only hairline concerns about sustained figurative density in every sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush but controlled; images such as "iron nails blooming with orange" and "the eels blinked like coins counting themselves" do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and theme—without clogging momentum. Sentence rhythm varies and carries the reader smoothly through a nearly uninterrupted paragraph of scene, an impressive technical feat. Figurative density is high but coherent; metaphors remain consistent with the physical and emotional logic of the piece. Any potential for purple prose is checked by strong narrative focus and an unbroken throughline of action and intention.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is lush, inventive, and generally precise, with high information density and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are fresh and internally coherent (“aurora…Earth’s own spine drinking star milk,” “ring poured mint, iron, and honey”) and support the conceptual system of taste-weather sensing. The density of figurative language is borderline-saturated, which may slightly reduce impact in places but does not obscure causality or closure. Rhythm varies well, and both opening and closing lines carry weight and echo earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, theme) and the rhythm on the page is controlled, especially in the closing paragraphs. However, figuration is very dense—nearly every line features a metaphor or elevated image—which risks occasional overload and could be selectively pared without loss. Despite that, clarity and momentum remain intact; there are no real loops, scaffolding artifacts, or syntactic confusions. The closure image is sharp and not blurred by the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is impressively tight: almost every sentence does at least two jobs (worldbuilding, character, mood), and figurative language is fresh and consistent with the story’s organic/mechanical lexicon. The rhythm varies nicely between longer, sinuous lines and shorter, anchoring beats, especially around key turns (“I stood still, because the gilding on my cuffs knows how to listen…”). Despite the density of imagery, there are no major metaphor tangles or paraphrase loops; clarity of action and stakes is maintained through the lyricism. A hair more sparing use of similes in one or two mid-paragraph runs could heighten impact by creating more contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, and thematic charge) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and coherent, supporting rather than smothering clarity. There’s minimal scaffold or looping; progression from image to image feels intentional. The only check at this tier is that near-constant lushness risks slight saturation, but it doesn’t materially blur causality or the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with little scaffolding, and imagery is often striking yet clear (“flames travel like careful handwriting,” “the desert will write new cursive in the dust”). Rhythm varies effectively, and there’s minimal redundancy or template cadence. The density of figurative language is high, especially in the opening, and occasionally risks saturation, but it seldom obscures cause-and-effect or the closure image. Tightening one or two of the more ornamental metaphors could sharpen impact further, yet the prose overall meets a high literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences do double duty for image and meaning, and metaphors are largely fresh and coherent (“wind inside a thimble,” “click like a teardrop touching wood”). There is dense figuration, but it feels patterned and purposeful rather than purple, and momentum is maintained. Redundancy is minimal and transitions are smooth. A hair more variation between lyric lines and plainer sentences at peak-pressure moments might sharpen impact further, but current control is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-by-line, the prose is dense yet largely precise, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without evident scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically unified around webs, music, rust, and pressure, avoiding mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies enough to prevent monotony, and the final cadence (“as a spider spins its web and steps back…”) lands cleanly. It flirts with purple at times, and a fraction more plain concrete action in the middle beats might sharpen momentum, but it remains well within elite-lit territory.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but efficient: most lines do double duty for worldbuilding and emotional charge (“cubes accrete like slow winter,” “names fall out like rain from summer canvas”). Figurative language is frequent yet coherent, with a strong controlling set of metaphors (gravity, salt, breath, bells, light) that rarely conflict or feel ornamental. There are no notable scaffold sentences, repetitions, or clarity breakdowns, and the rhythmic modulation towards the ending supports the sense of widening and then settling. A slight risk of over-lushness keeps it shy of the very top band, but momentum remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is striking: many sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and motion) with relatively little scaffolding, and the rhythm of long, sinuous lines fits the meditative ritual. Figurative language is frequent but internally coherent—“a lattice of almosts,” “a hush like velvet”—and rarely feels mixed or strained. There is some density where nearly every sentence carries a metaphor, which edges toward overrichness and slightly softens momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: high information density, layered metaphors that mostly cohere, and almost no scaffolding or redundancy. Sentences often do double duty, advancing scene and theme simultaneously (e.g., “the smile of someone for whom decades had become a single very considerate minute”). The risk is a near-relentless figurative texture that could verge on overrich for some readers, but syntactic variety and clear causality keep it from becoming mushy. A tiny bit more plainness at one or two peaks might give the best images more air.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is lush and information-dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once) while maintaining clarity. Metaphors are largely coherent, fresh, and internally consistent, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative density is very high and occasionally risks saturation, but the pattern is consistent enough to read as intentional style rather than purple drift. Syntax and punctuation are controlled, with strong openings and a charged final line that reactivates earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, precise, and information-dense, with most sentences doing triple duty (world, mood, and stakes). Metaphors are generally coherent and rooted in the story’s own vocabulary (ink, hinges, rivers, chains), and repetition (“calibrated treason,” hinges, unfinished strokes) functions as pattern rather than loop. There is some risk of overrichness—nearly every line carries an image—which may blunt the sharpness of a few key turns, but clarity and momentum remain intact. I see no significant scaffold, synonym churn, or rhythm artifacts that would need tightening for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) with minimal scaffolding, and rhythm varies effectively across the piece. Figurative language is dense but generally precise and thematically unified (braiding, ribs/heart, webs, braids of voices), avoiding mixed or confusing metaphors. There is mild risk of overload in places (“constellations shift-worked the sky” atop an already rich image field), but clarity and momentum remain intact. No significant repetition, synonym churn, or structural artifacts undercut the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences carry multiple layers of work (setting, emotion, theme) and the rhythm varies enough to keep the lyricism from turning to mush. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and fresh; metaphors like “candles bruise the blue with honey” and “the vessel sleeps under the glacier now, a burned ribcage in a blue cathedral” sharpen rather than blur. There is little to no scaffold or redundant paraphrasing, and syntax is clear despite the imagery. The only caution is that nearly every line is figurative, which risks saturation; a touch more plainness in key beats could heighten contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is highly polished: images are often doing double-duty (world-building and theme), and there is minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is lush (“like silk scraped from a chrysalis,” “like a bruise that consented to heal”) but largely coherent and voice-appropriate, avoiding mixed metaphors that would blur sense. Prose maintains momentum despite its density, in part because each sentence tends to add a new facet of pressure, image, or character. A few phrases edge toward ornamental, but they do not materially slow or obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is high: sentences are varied in length, dense with information, and usually carry more than one function (worldbuilding plus character, or image plus theme). Figurative language (“dust fell straight down as if on strings,” “a milky eye ran through it”) is vivid and coherent, not purple, and rarely stacks to the point of clutter. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; exposition about Stillwater is compressed but clear and in-voice. A few lines verge on aphoristic abstraction, but they don’t materially drag momentum or obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is lush but mostly disciplined: metaphors are striking and coherent, and sentences often do double duty (worldbuilding plus theme, or character plus stakes). Repetition of key phrases (“variant allegiance,” “fragmented radio frequencies,” “cobalt glass portico”) works as motif rather than dead loop, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. A few lines skate near purple or conceptual vagueness (e.g., “soldier aim,” “actuarial prayers”) but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure. With a slight trim of ornamental modifiers, this would be at a big-venue-ready polish level.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but purposeful: most sentences do at least two jobs (world, voice, and emotional shading) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Metaphors are frequent, yet they cohere around a few motifs (coins, jars, weather, breath) and rarely feel strained or mixed. Rhythm on the page is varied, with no mechanical template cadence or filter-verb stacks to drag momentum. The high figurative load in places nudges up against “lush,” but it doesn’t blur clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but mostly precise, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“reason braided with ache and oath”). Figurative language is frequent yet controlled; metaphors are coherent and thematically consonant (sound, ice, metal, vellum) rather than random ornament. There’s little to no scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence advances mood, world, or conflict. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the near-constant imagery occasionally edges toward saturation, risking reader fatigue in a few spots.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is notably strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and multitask (worldbuilding, theme, and character in one move). Figurative language is abundant but mostly coherent and purposeful, with very few strained or mixed metaphors; repetition patterns (“restrained wildness,” “unyoke”) are controlled rather than looped. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase redundancy, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism. The only restraint on an even higher score is the sheer density of metaphor in places, which edges close to saturation even though it doesn’t quite impede sense.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally do at least two jobs (world-building plus emotion, theme plus action). Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent (iron, lungs, echoes, doors), and it rarely muddies physical clarity. There are minimal scaffolding/loop issues, with almost no redundant restatements; syntax supports momentum even in reflective lines. The intensity of metaphor occasionally skirts purple, but it stays just the right side of controlled and does not blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and musical with high information density; most sentences carry both image and meaning (“a vibrant hush like theater lights held before the curtain lifts”). Metaphors are thematically coherent—storm, light, machinery—and rarely feel mixed or ornamental. There is some risk of saturation with simile, but rhythm and clarity hold, and there are no noticeable loops or scaffolding redundancies. The final line is clean, pointed, and recharges prior motifs without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is dense, inventive, and purposeful: most sentences do triple duty for character, world, and theme. Metaphors are abundant yet rarely mixed or self-contradictory, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Rhythm varies nicely; the piece reads aloud with momentum despite its lushness. The main limiter is that figurative language is almost continuous, so a few beats that might benefit from sharper, plainer contrast instead arrive as more of the same glittering register.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is dense but not purple: metaphors are fresh, coherent, and usually do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, tone, and theme). Sentences vary in length and structure enough to keep momentum, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few images risk saturation (weather, ghosts, echoes), yet they’re thematically aligned and don’t blur sense or closure. The final paragraphs, in particular, are clean and resonant, with no figurative muddle to dull the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: metaphors are fresh, coherent with the world’s logic (“the floes scraped and parted like arguments…”) and do more than one job each. There’s strong information density without noticeable scaffolding or synonym loops; nearly every line either advances situation, deepens character, or sharpens theme. Rhythm has pleasing variation, and the final paragraphs land cleanly without over-explaining. If anything, one or two abstract phrases (“courageous anomaly”) flirt with ornament, but they do not obscure sense or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences carry multiple jobs, images are fresh (“a photograph surfaced from under the ice like an eyelid”), and there is minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Rhythm varies well, and the piece reads smoothly aloud despite its complexity. The main weakness, under a very strict standard, is slight over-saturation of figurative language, which risks flattening impact in places even though clarity remains intact. Still, the closure beat is sharp and unsmudged by purple prose, preserving momentum and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush yet largely precise, with most metaphors coherent, layered, and tied to action or theme (“patience is a trellis only visible when wind maps it with motion”). Information density is high: lines routinely serve setting, character, and theme simultaneously, which maintains momentum despite the reflective mode. There is some risk of over-richness in clustered abstractions (“intersubjective understanding,” “conceptual weather report” moments), but clarity at closure remains intact and there is minimal scaffolding or repetition. Rhythm and paragraphing guide the reader cleanly through an essentially talk-based scene.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is highly controlled: dense with metaphor yet rarely muddled, with most sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, incantatory lines and shorter, grounding ones, and there’s little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. A few metaphors flirt with overload but maintain internal logic and sonic pleasure; they don’t obscure causality or closure. The final cadence (“clearings opening like courteous doors just before we knocked”) lands with clarity and earned music.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (image, emotion, and thematic echo) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. The figurative density is high, but vehicles stay coherent and non-competing, and rhythm varies pleasingly across the piece. There are no noticeable loops, synonyms-for-their-own-sake, or mechanical cadences; syntax supports the lyric mode without obscuring clarity or causality. If anything, the near-unbroken stream of metaphor edges toward saturation, but control and precision keep it from tipping into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is dense yet purposeful; most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, theme, and character) without evident scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but patterned and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or muddle even in peak beats. Rhythm varies well, and paragraphs feel necessary; there’s little that could be cut without losing nuance. The only restraint is that the consistently elevated register occasionally risks decorative flourish, but it never meaningfully obscures sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are musical yet clear, with high information density and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically unified around sound, tide, and obsolete media, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple clutter. The prose advances story, atmosphere, and character simultaneously, with well-timed breaths at structural beats (“He slid into that hollow, pressed record, and tasted salt”). A hair’s breadth of risk from metaphor saturation keeps it just shy of utterly flawless, but momentum and clarity remain intact throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but controlled; most sentences do double duty in advancing both image and emotional or thematic stakes. Metaphor use is frequent yet largely coherent and fresh (“Earth was a candle drowned in its own glass,” “cameras must blink faster than longing”) and rarely muddies clarity. There are minimal redundancies or scaffold lines, and syntax shifts appropriately with scene needs. The only constraint against even higher scoring is that a few lines tip toward overt abstraction, slightly softening the sharpness of otherwise impeccable line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and almost every image does double-duty for character and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, with very few metaphors feeling decorative rather than essential. There are no meaningful loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony; rhythm and paragraphing support momentum and emotional pacing. The only slight reservation is that the density of imagery flirts with overrichness in places, which might tax some readers at peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: high information density, varied sentence rhythm, and figurative language that is original yet legible (“noon sun shear our darkness like a net through water,” “quiet as an apology”). The prose consistently does double duty—worldbuilding and theme or character in the same line—without obvious padding or paraphrase loops. Metaphor density is high but feels patterned and coherent (loops, spirals, mechanical/astronomical textures) rather than purple or muddled, so momentum holds. A few final-paragraph lines verge on essayistic abstraction, but they don’t materially dull the closure image of welcoming the returning shadow-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but purposeful; nearly every sentence advances character, world, or theme while maintaining clarity. Figurative language is inventive yet coherent (“a chamber that felt cut from a lullaby,” “a hinge remembering its promise”) with no mixed metaphors or noticeable loops. Line-level rhythm modulates well between description, action, and reflection, avoiding both choppiness and monotony. If anything, the richness slightly reduces the sense of raw urgency, but it never muddies cause/effect or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is densely figurative yet mostly avoids muddle; images of breath, tide, light, and stone cohere into a clear symbolic vocabulary. Sentence rhythm varies well, with few redundancies and almost no scaffolding or template cadences; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or thematic texture. Despite the high metaphor count, clarity at the key decision and closing beats is not obscured. One could argue for slight over-richness in places, but it does not materially drag momentum or blur logic.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, theme) with little scaffolding or redundancy, and syntax varies to create a smooth reading rhythm. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and coherent, with recurring motifs (honey, hush, stitching, patterns) rather than random ornament. There’s minimal evidence of paraphrase-looping or template cadence; each sentence tends to advance or refract meaning. The density is very high and could arguably risk overload for some readers, but it rarely muddies clarity or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but disciplined: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without redundancy, and the rhythm varies in a way that would read well aloud. Figurative language is frequent yet internally consistent—water, pages, currents, and light recur as a coherent metaphor set—so the lyricism rarely muddies sense. There are almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops; progression is steady. The only constraint on a higher score is that the metaphor density is near-maximal throughout, leaving little room for sharper contrast or plainness at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding, with images doing multiple jobs at once (e.g., bees “scribbling approval” as ecological and spiritual confirmation). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and controlled, and syntax varies enough to avoid monotony. The closing cadence is particularly well-handled, with recurring motifs (harvest moon, breath, golden thread) braided into a satisfying finish. There is a slight risk of saturation—almost every line is “turned up,” which might benefit from a few plainer sentences for contrast—but this doesn’t significantly harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is excellent: high information density, generally clean syntax, and metaphors that are original yet legible (“moving stillness,” “winter riverbed,” “ravine like the seam of a palm”). Repetition feels intentional and pattern-driven, not like scaffold, and there are no obvious loops or filler lines. The prose does skate close to purple in places, but it remains coherent and supports mood and theme rather than obscuring them. Minor trims in a few multi-modifier sentences would make it utterly razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, image-rich, and generally multipurpose, with very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is dense, sometimes in nearly every sentence, but it stays within a controlled semantic field and rarely muddies sense or cause/effect. Phrases like “a bird that had learned to imitate chains” and “a yes that used no vowels” show high originality without strain. The sheer density of metaphor flirts with excess in places, preventing an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is lush and information-dense, with almost every sentence doing double duty for image and theme; rhythm and syntax are varied and pleasing aloud. Figurative language is abundant but rarely confused or contradictory, and key beats (“The Kerosene lamp burner turned into a small sun…”) remain clear. There is mild risk of saturation—nearly every line is metaphorical—which may slightly blunt impact over time, but it doesn’t obscure causality or closure. Minimal redundancy and no obvious scaffolding or template cadences appear.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: dense images often do double or triple duty for character, theme, and setting, and almost no sentence feels like scaffolding. The piece leans heavily into figurative language, but the metaphors are coherent, patterned (animals, steel, weather, time), and rarely feel mixed or gratuitous. Rhythm and syntax support the meditative pressure of the scene without bogging it down. A slight sense of relentless lyricism in places keeps this just under the very topmost band, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is polished and highly economical: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are imaginative and generally coherent, and rhythm modulates well between long, sinuous lines and sharper beats (“The wheel clicks, the lagoon repeats the vow, and the ghost accepts the currency…”). There’s a lot of figurative density, but it’s pattern-consistent and legible, not random ornamentation. A couple of images (“eyes are arranged in a sequence that does not match any clock”) flirt with abstraction, though they stay just on the right side of evocative rather than opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and generally multipurpose sentences that advance character, setting, and theme simultaneously. The figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled; metaphors (flows, mazes, bones, arteries) form a coherent system tied to infrastructure and bodies rather than devolving into mixed or purple prose. There is minor conceptual repetition around “flows,” “intention,” and “hope as system” that could be tightened for maximal sharpness in a top-tier market. Syntax and grammar are clean, and the final image (“clicks in her pocket like a star learning a new orbit”) lands with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is often beautiful and information-dense; many sentences carry image, worldbuilding, and emotion simultaneously. However, figurative language is nearly constant, and in a few places metaphors pile up (“mathematics of mercy, the architecture of letting something be itself”) in a way that risks slight purple excess and dilutes impact. There’s very little scaffolding or redundancy, and grammar and sequencing are clean. A few strategic cuts or plainer lines around peak beats would heighten contrast and make the best images land even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and images that usually perform multiple functions (atmosphere, theme, and plot) at once. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined, with few, if any, mixed or incoherent metaphors, and minimal redundancy or scaffolding. The prose maintains clarity even in its most ornate moments, and the closing images land cleanly. A slight tendency toward uniform lushness—rarely letting texture thin out to create contrast—keeps it just short of absolute top-band efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is finely wrought, with high information density—most sentences do double work in image and character or theme. Metaphors are thematically coherent (rope, seed, weather, weaving) and rarely feel strained; rhythm passes the read-aloud test without obvious scaffolding or loops. A few lines cluster abstractions (“their echoes thinned to superstition”) but are anchored enough by surrounding concrete detail to keep momentum. The lyrical density is near the upper limit for short work but remains clear and propulsive, supporting rather than obscuring the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is dense but largely disciplined: most metaphors are fresh, coherent, and multi-functional (“bottles flowering with message,” “ink slumped like tired soldiers”). There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or concept. The only arguable drawback is the near-constant figurative intensity, which edges toward saturation in places but does not blur meaning or obscure the closure image. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the piece propulsive despite its lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, theme) with vivid, precise metaphors and minimal scaffolding. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to maintain momentum despite a reflective, lyric mode. However, figurative density is very high across the entire piece—almost every line carries a metaphor—so there are moments where the pressure of imagery slightly threatens clarity or emotional focus. This controlled excess constitutes a minor case of overwriting, but it does not materially harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (image, theme, and character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and the cadence is pleasingly varied. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and thematically unified (fire, scars, tide, music), avoiding mixed-metaphor muddle. There is some risk of purple-prose saturation—nearly every line reaches for an image—so individual images have slightly less room to breathe. Still, clarity and momentum are preserved, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and minimal redundancy; most sentences accomplish multiple tasks (world-building, mood, and character all at once). The figurative language is frequent but coherent and purposeful (“shadows collected… like cooled tar,” “map bled into itself like wet ink”), avoiding mixed metaphors or muddle. Rhythm varies nicely between longer lyric constructions and shorter, anchoring statements, supporting momentum rather than stalling it. I see no significant scaffolding, loops, or artifacts that blur causality or dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most metaphors are fresh and coherent with the established physics of this world. Nearly every line carries figurative language, yet momentum holds and cause/effect remains clear—for instance, sonar leading to the lagoon, then the orrery solution. A couple of repetitions (“across the quiet sigh of falling petals”) flirt with self-consciousness but also serve as rhythmic and thematic anchors. The prose is lush enough that a ruthless editor might trim for concentration, but it rarely feels muddled or overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences multitask, combining image, emotion, and progression without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, and metaphors (“private storm under glass,” “the greenhouse breathed approval through its damp lungs”) cohere with the story’s established textures. There is little scaffold or looping, and the prose reads clean aloud. The only arguable weakness is the sustained high-density lyricism, which could benefit from an occasional plainer sentence to sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but purposeful; most sentences do double or triple duty in image, emotion, and concept without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is sustained and coherent around time, weight, sea, and wounds, avoiding mixed metaphors or muddle even in peak beats. Rhythm alternates between longer, meditative lines and sharper clauses (“round as a moon, heavy as guilt”) to good effect, and there’s minimal scaffolding or padding. Nothing at the line level obscures causality or dulls the closing image; if anything, it sharpens it.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is consistently strong: high information density, varied syntax, and metaphors that usually reinforce the core conceits of weaving, cartography, and gardening. Nearly every sentence pulls double duty for atmosphere and character, and the final paragraphs land with clean, specific images rather than abstract summary. The main limiter is the sheer density of figurative language—while mostly coherent, it occasionally approaches overload and risks reader fatigue in a longer piece. Still, there are no real artifacts, loops, or muddled comparisons, and closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but controlled: most sentences do more than one job, advancing concept, atmosphere, and character in tandem. Metaphors (trellis vs. wall, pressure under ice, the kingfisher’s flight) are consistent and reinforce the core idea without obvious mixing or confusion. There is mild risk of over-saturation—nearly every sentence is figurative—but clarity of action and stakes remains intact, and there’s little in the way of paraphrase loops or scaffolding. Line-level rhythm and syntax variety support momentum despite the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: images are inventive yet coherent, and most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and forward motion at once). Metaphors are abundant but thematically aligned (music, dust, weather, hunger) and rarely feel stacked for their own sake; rhythm is varied and read-aloud friendly. There’s minimal redundancy and no major scaffold or template cadence; the prose sustains momentum despite its lyricism. A few phrases (“thistled calm,” “gullible powder”) verge on precious, but they remain anchored enough in context to avoid purple-prose drag.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is lush but purposeful; most lines do at least double duty in image, mood, and character. Metaphors are coherent and motif-linked (charcoal, ash, glass, water, mirage) rather than random ornament, and rhythm on the page is varied and musical. There is minimal scaffold or repetition, and the closure image is crystal clear. The density of figurative language is high enough that an extremely strict editor might trim a line or two, but it rarely feels indulgent or confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries more than one job (worldbuilding, character, theme) with sharp, original imagery and minimal scaffolding. The metaphor density is high, but patterns are coherent (time/teeth/sediment/water) rather than florid for its own sake, and clarity is rarely at risk. There are no noticeable redundancy loops or clumsy constructions, and the final cadence (“brass and salt and the absence of applause”) lands cleanly. A very demanding editor might trim one or two metaphors in the middle stretch for breath, but this is close to publishable as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-by-line craft is consistently strong: vivid metaphors (“their coats damp with leaves,” “a thread cast across unlearning hatred”) do multiple jobs and rarely feel redundant. The prose maintains momentum despite its lushness; each sentence tends to advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. There is a high density of figurative language, but it is patterned and coherent rather than ornamental clutter, and clarity of action never suffers. Only a slight uniformity of lyric intensity keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and musical, with many lines doing double work (e.g., “Each cut felt like editing a paragraph in a grief that had run on for years without punctuation”). Metaphors are largely coherent, varied, and in-character, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every sentence advances texture, theme, or character. The figurative intensity is very high, skirting purple in a few places and risking reader fatigue in a longer work, but here it mostly holds. A bit more sparing use of overtly “poetic” abstractions would nudge this to the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense but remarkably efficient: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, theme) without redundancy, and figurative language is coherent and fresh. There are no noticeable scaffold phrases, loops, or mechanical cadences, and syntax shifts appropriately between meditative and immediate moments. The metaphor load is high enough that a few readers might need to slow down, which nudges this just below absolute top marks, but clarity and momentum remain intact. Opening and closing lines are especially strong, framing the piece with charged images rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“a handspan left of the sunmark,” “a lighter weave waits like an outlined hand”). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful; only rarely does it verge on decorative excess, and it does not obscure sense or closure. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but generally efficient: most sentences do multiple jobs, advancing image, world, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent, with few strained or mixed metaphors despite the high metaphor load. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; cadence varies enough to prevent monotony, and key lines (“a fissure is a flute if you press breath correctly”) land cleanly. The only slight limitation is that the near-constant lyrical register can blur micro-beats of causality for some readers, though closure remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is high: almost every sentence does double duty, advancing idea and mood with tight, surprising metaphors (“the air holds the tone of boundless confinement like a bell that never stops humming”). The repetition of motifs (dice, chalk, Tuesday, staircase) is pattern-taught and purposeful, not redundant. There is a slight risk of over-dense figurative language—nearly every line is metaphorical—which may fatigue some readers at prestige level, but clarity and momentum remain intact. No significant scaffolding, loops, or syntactic monotony undercut the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (image, mood, and character) and the rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt (“neon like exhausted fruit,” “lantern wrapped in tea cloth”) and does not muddle clarity. There’s minimal redundancy and no evident template cadences or filter-verb stacks. The density of metaphor is high, which may slightly soften urgency, but it never seriously obscures action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs—world-building, mood, and character—without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent (e.g., “bees trapped in porcelain caves,” “the roar closed over us like a book returning to its shelf”). Syntax varies and supports momentum; even the longer, baroque lines maintain clarity. The only minor brake on a higher score is that the sustained metaphor density slightly mutes sharpness of a couple of high-pressure beats, where a touch more plainness might have intensified immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and metaphors that are both fresh and coherent (“gulls become sketches, waves become equations”). The rhythm varies nicely between short, punchy lines and longer, sinuous sentences, and almost every sentence either advances action or deepens atmosphere. There is a lot of figurative language, but it feels deliberate and pattern-driven rather than ornamental, and clarity is preserved even at peak density. I see no real redundancy or scaffolding loops; at most, a few images flirt with purple but remain grounded enough to sustain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, emotion, theme) with little redundancy, and images are fresh (“dream dictionary scabbed with grease and glitter”). Figurative language is dense but controlled; metaphors rarely clash or over-accumulate, and rhythm varies to maintain momentum. Crucial beats—the confession, the flash, the unraveling—are rendered clearly despite the lyric surface. I see no meaningful scaffolding, loops, or muddled closures that would warrant deduction at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but highly purposeful: nearly every sentence does double duty in image and function, and figurative language stays within a coherent sonic-marine palette. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding; each new metaphor (e.g., clouds as “bar lines,” wave as “a long backed creature of water”) adds information or pressure. Syntax and punctuation are clean, and the rhythmic variety supports the accumulative drive without becoming monotonous. A reader inclined against lushness might find it almost too continuous in texture, but clarity and momentum through the climax and closing paragraphs remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (world, emotion, and theme), and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and purposeful; images like “shadow knitting itself into hexagons” and “the way dusk edits day” clarify rather than blur. Syntax flows smoothly, and the piece reads aloud with a controlled, incantatory rhythm suited to its accumulative structure. The only restraint on a higher score is that the unbroken metaphorical richness risks saturation; one or two plainer anchoring lines at peak beats might heighten contrast and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, dense, and largely free of scaffolding; nearly every sentence carries either image, character, or thematic work. Recurring motifs like ivy, ledgers, and timetables are woven in without feeling mechanically repetitive, and there’s good syntactic variety. The language occasionally leans toward the lush—many metaphorical turns in close succession—but it remains coherent and does not blur action or causality. I see no significant loops, artifacts, or rhythm glitches that would hinder publication-level readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is densely figurative yet remarkably efficient: most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character, and there is little true scaffolding or repetition. Images are largely precise and coherent (e.g., “columns rise from water like interrupted thoughts,” “algae flutter like patient pennants”), with minimal metaphor muddle. Rhythm on the page is varied, and the paragraphing keeps momentum despite the reflective mode. The only restraint on a higher score is that the consistently lush style flirts with overload in places, which might slightly blunt impact for an elite editor.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but remarkably efficient: most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent yet controlled, with images consistently grounded in water, study, and machinery; I saw no mixed metaphors or syntactic muddle. Sentence rhythm varies well, and key beats (“Now, under algae stars, I had proof…”) are given clear, uncluttered phrasing. One might argue for minimal trimming in non-peak lines, but there is no real momentum drag or artifact that touches the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is densely figurative yet generally precise, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Rhythm varies nicely, and images largely cohere around light, glass, flight, and memory without mixing metaphors incoherently. A few spots risk saturation—nearly every line carries an image, which may slightly blur impact for some readers—but clarity and momentum through the ritual and ending remain intact. Line-level control is strong enough for immediate publication in many top venues, though a ruthless copy edit could prune one or two ornamental phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and sentences that often do double or triple duty (“Bleak exhilaration lifts me, the rush of saving nothing on purpose, the mercy of learning to leave”). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically focused on sky, light, reservoirs, and instruments, avoiding mixed or confusing metaphors. There are no noticeable loops or synonym churn; each sentence tends to introduce a fresh angle or deepen an existing image. I’m slightly below 9 because the sheer density of imagery occasionally risks saturation, with a few lines feeling more ornamental than strictly necessary to the core beat.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: metaphor density is high but mostly coherent and purposeful (“brilliant dimness,” “map made of rests”), and nearly every sentence pulls weight for image, theme, or motion. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; syntax varies and momentum never stalls despite the conceptual focus. No major figurative muddle or mixed-metaphor patches undercut the climax. A couple of abstractions could be pared without loss, but they do not materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but largely earns its lyricism: most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, emotion, and theme) without clear redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is coherent and consistently water/ledger/wood themed rather than a jumble of unrelated images. Rhythm varies between long, flowing lines and sharper beats (“a shard of time pointing at nothing and everything”), sustaining momentum despite introspection. There is mild risk of over-saturation—nearly every sentence is metaphorically charged—but this does not obscure causality or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is very strong: high information density, nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs (setting, theme, character) without redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically aligned (tide, breath, furrows, clocks, moon), avoiding mixed metaphors that blur sense. Syntax and paragraphing create an audible rhythm that matches the story’s solemn, incremental pressure. If anything, the steady metaphorical saturation slightly flattens micro-variations in intensity, but it never obscures causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is strong: high information density, purposeful metaphor, and almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with very few strained or mixed images, and the prose remains legible even at its most lyric. Momentum is maintained across reflection through tight anchoring to present stimuli and forward motion (launch and crossing). A handful of metaphors (e.g., “buttered the water”) flirt with purple but don’t materially blur sense, keeping this just under the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is dense but purposeful: most sentences do at least two jobs (world, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. The imagery is consistently coherent, and repeated phrases like “delicately robust” read as motif rather than churn. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to maintain momentum, with very few lines that could be cut without loss. The main risk is slight metaphor saturation, but clarity and closure remain intact, so it reads as deliberate style rather than purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is lush and information-dense; most sentences perform multiple functions (world, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and legible, with strong recurring vehicles (spice, moon, animals) preventing metaphor muddle. A few phrases verge on ornamental (“small moons,” “fields of hidden suns”) but they still fit the established pattern rather than feeling like random flourish. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to sustain momentum through a heavily lyrical piece.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, emotion, theme) with minimal redundancy, and rhythms vary to sustain momentum. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled; images like “minutes in the saucer, each one glinting like an apology finally believed” are both clear and surprising. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding lines, and grammar and sequencing are clean. A few metaphors border on saturation, but they generally cohere with the established palette and do not obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but remarkably efficient: most sentences pull double duty for worldbuilding, character, and theme, as in “the ship’s old programs stood down like tired veterans.” Figurative language is frequent yet coherent; metaphors of stitching, scars, gravity, and breath form a tight network rather than a muddle. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the final lines (“not victorious but kept”) land with clear, uncluttered impact. The only reason this doesn’t push into the absolute top is that the saturation of imagery edges toward overload in places and might benefit from one or two plainer beats to sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image + emotion + theme), rhythms vary, and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is dense but rarely muddled; most metaphors are fresh and coherent with the established aesthetic. The prose keeps momentum even during reflective stretches, helped by concrete anchors and active verbs. The only minor limitation, from a demanding editorial lens, is occasional over-saturation of imagery where a plainer sentence might have sharpened contrast and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is remarkably economical for such lush imagery; most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, characterization, and thematic echo) without feeling padded. Metaphors are inventive and largely coherent with the story’s physical and emotional logic, establishing a textured pattern (“winking hush,” “infant with fists,” “teeth in the wheel”) rather than a random flourish. There are no obvious scaffolding loops or template cadences, and syntax shifts in step with scene intensity. The only small debit is that figurative density is consistently high, which may slightly blur a few beats for some readers, but it does not harm closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences are packed with information and image, yet remain intelligible, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but not muddled; motifs (salt, light, sliding, breath) recur in intentional patterns that support momentum rather than stall it. The closing cadence (“I let go of the bowl, and it does not flee, and neither do I”) cleanly crystallizes prior images without over-explaining. A slight over-richness in metaphor density in a few mid-paragraph stretches keeps this out of the absolute top tier but does not harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with images that generally do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, theme, and emotion in a single line). Nearly every sentence carries figurative language, which flirts with over-saturation but holds together due to consistent motifs and clarity—very little feels muddled. Redundancy is minimal; repeated phrases (“furiously tranquil,” “cartography of scars”) function as charged leitmotifs rather than scaffolding. There are no significant syntactic artifacts, tense slips, or clarity failures that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is sophisticated: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, character, theme) with minimal scaffolding, and the rhythm modulates effectively between contemplative and combative moments. Figurative language is dense but rarely muddled; images like “hands folded like questions that expect applause” and “path forward… like music under a cough” feel precise rather than ornamental. There are no noticeable loops or explanatory paraphrases, and action remains clear despite lyric compression. The sheer concentration of metaphor occasionally flirts with overload, but it does not obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is highly controlled: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (image, theme, character) without obvious scaffolding, and rhythm varies in a way that would read aloud beautifully. Figurative language is dense but coherent, with recurring vehicles (books, gates, seeds, currency) rather than scattershot metaphor; there are no serious muddles or mixed images. A couple of near-redundant phrasings (the prison-library origin repeated almost verbatim) brush close to paraphrase, but they function more like intentional refrain than accidental looping. Overall, information density and propulsion are excellent for a lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense with figurative language but largely avoids muddle; most metaphors extend the same lexicons of music, trains, time, and tide, giving the piece strong internal coherence. Sentences pull multiple weights—advancing action while building atmosphere and theme—and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few lines approach the edge of overload, but clarity at key beats (the reel’s use, the arbor’s function, the reunion) remains intact. Rhythm, sentence variety, and image choice would meet the standards of many top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme) with vivid metaphors that generally cohere and remain concrete. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum is maintained despite the density of image. The figurative language is indeed lush, but it rarely feels muddled or contradictory, and closure beats (“rain… like a library walking,” “a lantern whose wick is soaked in tenderness”) are sharp and legible. Slight uniformity of high lyric intensity keeps it just below the very top tier, as a bit more modulation or spareness in key beats could heighten contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, emotion, theme) and the metaphors are generally apt and fresh. There is heavy figurative density, but it’s patterned and legible rather than muddled; only occasionally does the prose flirt with over-ornamentation. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the final third in particular reads cleanly and precisely. No evident scaffolding or loops materially dull momentum or obscure cause/effect.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic, with no scaffold or idle phrasing. Metaphors are precise and logically consistent with the POV ("patient as lichen," "timing a pulsar"), and the sentence-level propulsion mirrors the protagonist's methodical, stabilizing mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.7)
    Significant repetitive sentence starters ("I reached," "I am," "I carried," "I walked," "I wanted") create a monotonous template cadence. High density of abstract metaphors ("stubborn grammar of rust") occasionally obscures clarity and feels overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is high-density and evocative, with image-rich phrasing that avoids emptiness ("curdled into nothing," "fretted into lace"). The metaphor of "midwifing crescendos" is bold but works within the context of the father's legacy. There is no scaffold or loop drag; the rhythm of the sentences mirrors the "fragile endurance" of the narrator’s state.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is high-density and evocative, but suffers from a heavy reliance on simile scaffolding ("like folded velvet," "like fingernails," "like an old librarian," "like a shawl"). This repetitive syntactic pattern creates a slight drag on momentum during high-pressure beats, momentarily favoring decoration over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    Metaphor density is dangerously high ("beard held decades like leaves hold rain"), bordering on overwriting. The verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("amplified quiet" x3, "gently persistent" x2) creates a distinct scaffold artifact that disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density that clogs the rhythm ("tiny trumpets," "slow comet," "nebula") and frequent interpretive telling ("droplets arrange as a code of forgiveness"). Several sentences function as definitions or thesis statements ("Unused love is a lamp waiting for its oil") rather than narrative beats, reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rich with imagery ("frost stenciled lace"), but suffers from a repetitive reliance on simile constructions (over ten "like/as" comparisons in a short space). This syntactic tic creates a predictable cadence that dampens the momentum of otherwise striking descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with strong, unexpected imagery. The simile "cup a seed like a fragile verb" is a minor register slip, introducing a meta-writerly metaphor that momentarily distracts from the character's diegetic reality.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Imagery is dense and evocative ("whitening hiss," "hands like nets"). However, a repetitive "I [verb]" sentence structure in the latter half ("I needed," "I loaded," "I took," "I listened") creates a plodding rhythm that drags on the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes ("like a heartbeat," "like a tide," "like a lantern," "like minnows," "like bells") that creates a cluttered texture. The prompt phrase "luminous disbelief" is repeated as a static descriptor for two different characters, breaking immersion, and "quietly savvy" is inserted as a clumsy "tell."

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from relentless anthropomorphism (timid fingernails, shy fire, stubborn glass, patient questions, licking tongue) that obscures the physical reality of the scene. This density of figurative language acts as a barrier, replacing concrete sensory details with constant metaphorical interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose suffers from metaphor density that slows momentum; phrases like "pages flaking like scabs," "ribs stopped counting exits," and "paperwork silence" clutter the line level. The relentless figurative language obscures clarity in favor of mood.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive synonym churn ("hush," "silence," "quiet" appear repeatedly) and the specific phrase "marbled hush" is used three times, creating a noticeable loop that drags momentum. Some metaphors border on purple prose ("syruped quietude"), reducing the immediacy of the instruction. Line-level craft is evocative but needs pruning for repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose density is very high with zero scaffold or fluff. Metaphors are fresh and rigorously aligned with the narrator’s worldview ("composure holds the dust together"). The rhythm varies effectively, slowing down alongside the protagonist in the final third to mirror the narrative shift.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from repetitive looping of specific phrases ("after words become unnecessary," "resonant hush," "crystal whispering forecourt"), likely strictly adhering to a prompt list. These repetitions feel mechanical rather than rhythmic, creating scaffold artifacts that break immersion. The density is good, but the "purple" modifiers sometimes obscure rather than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-functioning imagery ("like twine knotted just enough to hold"). Sentences do double duty, advancing the plot while deepening the atmosphere. The phrasing "teach memory how to walk" is particularly strong, anchoring the abstract magic in physical terms.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant "simile churn," with over a dozen "like" or "as" constructions ("like a careful thought," "like embered breath," "like folded sails," "like a tide") crowding the text. This template cadence flattens the rhythm and distracts from the otherwise clear imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong density and rhythm. A few similes lean slightly toward the ornate ("sliced the air like cracked glass," "indecisive fireflies"), but the overall line-level craft effectively supports the story's mood and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic ("answers as wind, not words"), with high information density and strong imagery. The refrain of "swallowed truth" is slightly repetitive but functions effectively as a fever-mantra without breaking flow.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose density is high, but the text suffers from figurative overcrowding and mixed metaphors (e.g., "shadows punch the clock with their fists," "panic smears truth like grease"). These artifacts distract from the scene's physical immediacy and muddy the causal flow.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from metaphorical density that occasionally slows momentum ("moths that had outgrown the idea of flame," "lightning that forgot to vanish"). While the imagery is striking, the relentless layering of figurative language draws attention to the writing itself rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.0)
    Figurative density is excessively high, with a "like/as" simile appearing in nearly every beat (heartbeat, note, cup, shawl, seed, stars). This reliance on comparison over direct description creates a repetitive cadence and filters the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.7)
    Imagery is often striking ("shelves were made of echoes"), but the prose suffers from repetitive artifacting. The phrase "bronze quiet" appears four times in a short space, shifting from motif to redundancy, and "sensitively perceptive" is redundant and clunky.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical clutter ("glass cathedral," "citrus memory") that prioritizes poetic sounding-ness over precision. Several moments "tell" the emotional resonance ("room exhaled as if untying a tight knot") instead of showing it through interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is superb, with high density and fresh imagery ("bruise agreeing with a staircase"). A minor repetition of "purred" (color purred/loops purring) is the only slight blemish in an otherwise polished text. The rhythm effectively mirrors the breathing/looping motif.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is rhythmically assured and dense with striking imagery ("cymbals kissing instead of crashing," "choir of felted hammers"). The repetition of "upturned hush" functions effectively as a musical motif, reinforcing the story's structural logic without feeling repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the prose has a strong rhythmic quality, it suffers from metaphor density and mixed figures (e.g., "decisions I was afraid to play," "mouth full of river light") that can obscure meaning. The reliance on explicit directions from the tablet ("The tablet said...") to advance the plot is a mechanical slip in an otherwise atmospheric piece. The oxymoron "darkening brightness" borders on being a stylistic tic.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong but incredibly dense with figurative language ("stone breaths," "timid bird," "candle deciding to be fire"), occasionally bordering on overwriting. The required phrase "audibly muted" is used twice and feels slightly oxymoronic and clunky in a way that disrupts the otherwise smooth lyrical flow. The density of metaphor slows propulsion in places.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is dense with imagery but marred by repetitive phrasing (repeating "credibly curious" and "unowned") and the "I [verb]" scaffold. High metaphor density sometimes obscures clarity ("pencil as blunt as grief," "flew through difficult taste"), drifting into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.3)
    While the imagery is dense, the prose suffers from overwriting and mixed metaphors ("smiled like a patient storm," "eyes to fountains"). Crucially, the climax intellectualizes the emotion with diagnostic adjectives ("mnemonic, precise") instead of trusting the raw action, reducing immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, achieving high information density with lines like "trailing breath like torn silk." While the figurative load is heavy, it remains coherent; no loops or artifacts impede the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("cracked honey," "moods of gulls"). There are no significant artifacts, though the density of metaphor occasionally slows momentum. The rhythm supports the contemplative mood well.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is high-density and evocative ("fish hear riverbeds"), though the metaphorical saturation is intense and occasionally risks overwriting. A minor capitalization artifact ("Fragrance chemist's") slightly disrupts the visual flow, but the rhythm remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from extreme metaphor density ("gulls edit the sky," "trembled like surf," "blushed like a buoy"), cluttering nearly every beat with similes. This overwriting obscures the action and creates a "purple" texture that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose relies heavily on "like" similes ("like thawing bells," "like buried birds," "like dew," "like permission"), creating a repetitive syntactic cadence. While individual images are lovely, the high metaphor density slows momentum and occasionally muddles clarity in service of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and imagistic without sacrificing momentum. Phrasing like "curiosity nibbles through warnings like moss" and "air syrup-thickens" creates a distinct textural quality. The description of the echo’s birth is a standout example of high-density writing that advances the plot while building atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in lines like "reflections like equations." However, the text occasionally leans into abstraction ("secrecy softens," "invention keeps the hush") that can obscure physical grounding. The prompt word "dovetail" appears three times in close proximity, creating a repetitive artifact that momentarily distracts from the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("voice the exact grade of paper"), though the repetition of "hush" in paragraph 4 and the density of metaphors ("glass turning to water") slightly crowd the reading line. The mechanics of the tape repair are described with pleasing precision.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like the "coffee ring like a compass." At times, the density of metaphor risks becoming overwrought ("ledger lined up like seed flats in a pivoted sun"), but the line-level craft remains disciplined and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from high metaphor density that occasionally threatens momentum ("tide like a tired lung," "ribs ring like brass"). Additionally, the verbatim repetition of unique phrases like "haggard awe" and "unearthed convergence" within a short space creates noticeable lexical artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose quality is high, with excellent information density and fresh imagery ("voice like a bell dipped in water"). The pacing is well-managed, and the list of ordinary sounds in the climax creates a strong rhythmic peak without falling into mere listing or scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical density that occasionally obscures the image or feels straining (e.g., "ropes sneeze," "tapped me with ten thousand knuckles"). The relentless figurative language in the opening beats creates a slight "purple" effect that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from simile saturation ("hummed like tuning forks," "folded like a transfer ticket," "folded like a blade," "curling like a signature," "glowed like nerves"). This density obscures the scene's physical reality. Phrasing like "asked without asking" is a cliché that weakens the specific magic.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is technically proficient but suffers from high figurative density that occasionally slows momentum (e.g., "seams opened like eyelids," "curtain coughs dust"). Some metaphors feel stacked or synesthetic to the point of opacity ("pressure that bent the light"), distracting from the scene's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("light becomes lances," "veins of quartz"), creating a strong textural experience. A few metaphors feel slightly strained or surreal ("tide with ears," "intrigue... fruit"), but the rhythmic control remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmically controlled, but the density of figurative language in the high-pressure climax ("turns muscle to wire," "breach like a verdict," "handcuff us") triggers the density penalty. While beautiful, the metaphor stacking momentarily draws attention to the writing rather than the action during the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density (e.g., "air could bruise," "silence name its colors," "invisible grammars"). While individual images are lovely, the aggregate effect is sluggish, and the repetition of the phrase "incandescent restraint" feels unintentional or forced.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but it suffers from a high density of figurative language that occasionally impedes momentum ("floats like diesel sheen," "curled like a secret tongue," "like a murder," "like brackets"). The relentless use of simile creates a slight "overwriting" effect, where the imagery draws attention to the author's hand rather than the scene's reality. A few metaphors feel strained ("murder that had learned to bathe").

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in images like the "ribs and spine of a half-finished cello." The recurring phrase "gloomy cheerfulness" works as a refrain. Line-level craft is polished, though occasionally the metaphor density threatens to slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished but suffers from "writerly" overwriting, including synesthetic abstractions ("Hopeful desperation had a smell") that tell rather than show. The density of figurative language often slows the momentum of pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is dense and often lovely, it suffers from mixed or strained metaphors in key moments. "Logos comb their antlers" confuses the imagery (hunting vs. combing), and "swallowing the Milky Way like bread" feels awkward. These artifacts distract from the otherwise high-quality imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is overwrought, relying on heavy personification ("depot breathed," "engines whispered") and adjectival stacking that slows momentum. The repetition of "magnetic calm" and "prayer" feels repetitive rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("more rust than shelter"). A few images teeter on the edge of purple prose or mixed metaphor (smelling "long syntax" breaks sensory logic even in a magical context). Overall, the line-level craft is sophisticated and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is overwritten with metaphor congestion ("smoke-dark hum," "lucid silence"). Key phrases ("wild hush," "infinitely patient") are repeated verbatim, creating a loop artifact that dulls the polish.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("braided with cables," "patient saints"), showing high craft. A few metaphors in the action beat ("knots confessed," "loosened shyly") lean slightly towards the precious, slowing momentum, but the overall rhythm and imagery are masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.7)
    The unrelenting density of figurative language occasionally drifts into muddle (e.g., "history wipes on its teeth," "gulls hover like commas"). While evocative, the heavy metaphorical load slows momentum and risks overwriting in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("sap remembered thunder"), with high information density and strong rhythm. However, the score is capped by the register artifacts mentioned in Q6 and some reliance on telling via adverbs ("lovingly venomous," "mournful elation") that disrupt the otherwise high-quality textural work.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically assured, with high image density ("sew grief into nets"). At times, the metaphoric saturation borders on overwriting ("exhales a cool hush," "orchid solace"), but the craft is undeniable and fits the fable-like mode.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is overwritten, suffering from a high density of forced similes (&quot;skulls winked like lanterns,&quot; &quot;questions like water&quot;) that clutter the visual field. This metaphorical saturation obscures the action and creates a &quot;purple&quot; texture that distracts from the emotional reality.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("stamps remember mouths"). The phrase "futuristic nostalgia" reads as a slight tell in an otherwise immersive text, momentarily breaking the show-don't-tell immersion. The rhythm is excellent, though the density of metaphor is high; nearly every sentence carries figurative weight, which risks saturating the reader, though it is executed with skill.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("singer who dreams mid verse") with excellent rhythmic control. Information density is high, avoiding scaffold while maintaining a lyrical momentum that suits the magical realism tone.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    While individual images are striking, the prose suffers from "simile churn" ("like swallows," "like a saint," "like cousins," "like roots," "like a blade"). This repetitive scaffolding draws attention to the writing rather than the scene, disrupting the otherwise dense immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly polished and rhythmically controlled, but the density of figurative language is relentless ("fog stitched," "windows breathe," "tide turned vowels"). While beautiful, this saturation in nearly every sentence slightly drags on the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from severe "simileitis," with nearly every sentence relying on a "like" or "as" construction ("like a bruised pear," "like a sleeping fern," "like birds"). This figurative density stalls momentum and creates a monotonous rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but dense with figurative language (six similes/metaphors in the middle section alone), which occasionally slows momentum. While images like "chalk on black glass" strike true, phrases like "breath under silk" feel slightly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is vivid and high-density, but it suffers from a pervasive "simile tic" (over 13 instances of "like [noun]" or similar constructions). This repetitive syntactic pattern creates a template cadence that draws attention to the writing itself, detracting from immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.8)
    A major unmotivated tense shift disrupts the reading experience (past to present). The prose is dense with metaphor but suffers from repetition of the prompt's specific phrasing ("shyly unstoppable"), creating a loop artifact that distracts from the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush and imaginative ("bookends waddling" is a delight), driving the story's ethereal tone. However, occasional metaphorical density ("soft as foghorn cotton") borders on the abstract, slightly obscuring clarity in favor of poetic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.0)
    Severe overwriting via simile density ("like a choir," "like staves," "like a drop," "like a metronome," "like a woven staff"). The relentless figurative language clogs the rhythm and obscures the scene's physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is rhythmic and dense with specific imagery ("bats threaded the portals," "math and mercy arguing"). While polished, it occasionally risks overwriting with adjective-heavy phrasing, but the momentum generally holds.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense and image-rich, with strong lines like "ledger pages curl like low tide" and "rattled like bone." However, the integration of the required phrase in the final sentence ("Across learning to trust again, I keep...") creates a jarring syntactic stumble that disrupts the rhythm at the crucial closing moment. A few metaphors ("trust cracked like shell") lean toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished but suffers from high metaphor density; nearly every image is mediated through a simile ("like vortex rings," "like compass roses," "like flight paths," "like prayers," "like a broken sundial"). This constant comparative structure creates a layer of scaffolding that distances the reader from immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from mixed metaphors ("voice made a seam... steadied my racing maps") and evident prompt-forcing artifacts. The repetition of complex phrases like "softly ingenious" and "luminous respite" within a short space feels artificial and disrupts the rhythm. The density of adjectives and abstract nouns obscures the action, prioritizing sound over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.5)
    High density of figurative language ("cheerful as a bruise," "cobweb math," "light stepping") borders on purple prose and occasionally obscures clarity. Scaffold phrases ("I came to discover") slow the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose quality is exceptional, with high information density and vivid imagery ("stones drank the chalk," "blueprint dissolving into the organism"). The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the "metronome" of the sea described in the opening. There are no significant loops or artifacts; the writing is polished, precise, and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "gaps are portals." However, the integration of required phrases—specifically the repetitive "moonstone cabochon dust speck" and "spontaneously anchored"—feels mechanically inserted and disrupts the otherwise smooth flow. These artifacts slightly mar the line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is suffocated by metaphor density ("ripple script," "grammar the mouth forgets") that obscures action. The relentless personification creates a "textual shimmer" that stalls momentum, and the "fog trumpet" line is opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Imagery is often striking ("flame lifted the roof like a closing fist"), showing strong descriptive capability. However, the prose is marred by abstract phrasing ("doubt braided into his quiet stride") and the literal pasting of prompt requirements ("hard softness") which disrupts flow. These artifacts call attention to the construction rather than the story world.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and evocative, though occasionally dense with metaphor ("hush of a patient lung") that slows momentum. The writing is technically sound, but the relentless poetic register sometimes prioritizes beauty over narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and dense with imagery ("tiles etched like topographies," "walls dream in montage"). A few metaphors feel slightly strained or mixed ("groaned like a throat swallowing rain," "slumped like wilted fins"), preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.3)
    While much of the prose is lyrical and dense (&quot;swallows spooled their quiet&quot;), the rigid repetition of the phrase &quot;prism parapet after rain&quot; (appearing three times as a clumsy compound noun) disrupts syntactic flow and reads as a forced constraint artifact. This specific repetitiveness significantly hampers the line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic ("each knot a throat cleared toward confession"), with high information density. A few similes, such as "exhales like an uncle" and "knees knock, which is how families begin," clash slightly with the established high-register tone, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high-quality imagery ("careful as contrition," "thunder muttered like an old judge"). The phrasing supports the tone without becoming decorative; lines like "names are only half-truths" deepen the texture efficiently. No scaffolding artifacts or loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a high density of "Abstract Noun of Abstract Noun" constructions ("harvest of echoes," "lullaby of conformity," "blade of absence"). While individual images are striking ("crystals hung like verdicts"), the frequency of similes creates a slight textural monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is high-density and evocative ("trembled like an artery," "bruise legible") with excellent rhythmic control. The writing avoids artifacts and maintains momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("kneel to knot," "petal burning"), with high information density. The repetition of "blushing stillness" creates an effective structural frame, though some metaphorical phrasings ("silence held a blush") skirt the edge of being overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is high-density and polished, with strong rhythmic control and evocative imagery. A few phrases feel slightly overwrought ("snowmelt ardor"), but the line-level craft generally supports the magical realism aesthetic well.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high metaphorical density that occasionally obscures meaning (e.g., "grit that polished every breath," "vocals of owls"). While many images are striking ("arithmetic of snail trails"), the cumulative effect borders on purple prose, slowing momentum with adjectival richness where stronger verbs would serve better.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high-impact phrasing like "counting each item like coins he dared not spend." The extended metaphors of economy ("ledger," "afford") are consistent and clever, enriching the text without distraction.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.9)
    Imagery is dense and often striking ("pulse stuttered like hooves," "lungs through nettles"), but the prose occasionally suffers from mixed or strained metaphors ("thorn had learned mercy," "kindled stiffness"). A few lines feel overwrought, reducing clarity for the sake of lyricism. The density of similes slows the reading rhythm slightly more than necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.5)
    Line-level craft is significantly marred by the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("erasing boundaries," "synchronized breathing," and "glass mountains" each appear three times). These repetitions create a mechanical scaffold that disrupts the immersion and prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose density is high with strong rhythmic control; lines like "mistakes, which is a school that never expels anyone" are memorable aphorisms. The anthropomorphism of nature ("pears considering gravity") is frequent but fits the established fable-like tone. No significant artifacts or loops disrupt the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("stones... glowed like sleepy moons"). A few metaphors feel slightly precious ("edited the air"), but the rhythm is controlled. No significant artifacts or loops interrupt the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush and high-density, successfully sustaining the magical realism tone. While beautiful, a few metaphors (e.g., "relents like drought") teeter on the edge of clarity, but the overall rhythm and specific imagery ("margins stitched with moss") are masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density. Occasional metaphorical strain ("pocket storms," "trembling grammar") pushes toward abstraction, but the sensory grounding generally holds the surrealism together.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is high, with excellent phrasing like "civic patience" and "feeding it soup until it spoke." The prose is dense and propulsive, avoiding scaffold artifacts and keeping the reader grounded in the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high information density and strong imagery. However, the reliance on metaphorical constructions and personification ("crawls slow as a beast," "throat had kissed it") borders on overwriting, slightly distancing the reader from the physical immediacy of the danger.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative with high information density ("swallowed word," "navigable whiteness"). The rhythm supports the pacing, particularly in the climax where the sentence structures mimic the "remembered rhythm" of the beacon. No significant artifacts or loops were detected.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, but the insertion of the required phrase "crystal whispering forecourt after rain" in the climax creates a jarring syntactic stumble. Some scaffolding phrases ("My conjecture tonight is simple") flatten the momentum, though images like the "pale reefs" redeem the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant deductions apply for the ungrammatical tense shift and artifact loops (repeating the clunky phrase "fire spinner's kerosene rag knot" three times). The metaphor density is high, occasionally blurring clarity ("petals seemed cautious").

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose suffers from excessive metaphorical density, violating the rubric's overwriting check. Phrases like "silence spilled like low tide," "night inch its own grammar," and "words were a door" stack up to stall narrative momentum, creating opacity rather than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and dense with high information load ("coins rinsed in sunrise," "wet iron"). While beautiful, the figurative language is nearly relentless; a few simpler grounding sentences might have amplified the impact of the complex imagery, but the rhythm remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally lush and precise, but the opening paragraph suffers from clumsy repetition ("drifted... drifting") and a recycled phrasing of the timeframe that reads like a stutter. These initial slips mar an otherwise high-quality textural execution.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is high-density and polished, with strong rhythmic control and evocative imagery ("lenses folding like origami"). While occasionally skirting the edge of purple ("spray ticked my skin with tiny static stars"), the style is purposeful and devoid of loop artifacts or scaffold sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from extreme metaphor density and simile reliance ("heavy as a lung," "like fine salt," "like a ladle," "like lips," "like attendants," "like notes"), which clogs the pacing. The incessant use of "like/as" structures creates a rhythmic monotony and obscures the action behind layers of figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and lyrical, with high information density and strong imagery ("pressure is patient and circles are doors"). A few moments suffer from "prompt insertion" stiffness, where required phrases like "glitchy text messages from parallel dimensions" are pasted in verbatim, slightly disrupting the rhythmic flow. Otherwise, the line-level craft is sharp and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is rhythmic and dense, but marred by the repetition of the phrase "eloquently silent" and some strained metaphors ("muscles of the hum"). "First yawn of evening" reads as a slightly stock opening, though the rest of the imagery is specific.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from simile saturation, with "like" or "as" appearing in nearly every descriptive beat ("like lamps," "like a sighing moth," "like vines," "like a key," "like eyes," "like a closed book," "like lenses"). This creates a repetitive template cadence that interrupts immersion and clutters the visual field with comparative vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is often vivid, the verbatim repetition of three distinctive multi-word phrases ("accumulated dust patterns," "magnify small kindnesses," "tactfully hopeful") within a short space creates a mechanical stutter. This lack of lexical variety in key descriptors disrupts the otherwise high-quality immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from simile overload ("peeled like molting snakes," "sigh open like a confession," "flutter like uncertain moths"), which clogs the rhythm and reduces impact. High-pressure beats are diluted by abstract metaphors ("spilling the grid's music"), sacrificing clarity for ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is lush and musical, but the density of figurative language is relentless ("breath borrowed," "moon scale," "sealed eyelid," "filigree trembling"), occasionally threatening to obscure physical action. Specific similes like "bubbles that burst like nods" feel weak and twee compared to the surrounding strength. The high stylistic load creates a rich texture but slightly slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density ("mulch of memory," "braided in one wind"). While the required phrases sometimes feel slightly grafted, the surrounding sentence craft supports them with strong imagery and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the imagery is dense, the syntax suffers from repetitive subject-verb openers ("I noticed," "I traced," "I tightened," "I followed"). Additionally, the prompt phrase "befriend uncertainty in planning" is pasted in twice verbatim, disrupting the prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is burdened by a high density of "X is Y" aphorisms ("Guilt is the flux," "Precision is my romance"), creating a monotonous, lecturing rhythm. Strained metaphors and the sheer volume of abstract assertions stall narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Imagery is often stunning ("hat spin away like a moon that forgot everything it lit"). The score is held back slightly by a tendency toward "adjective-abstract noun" constructions ("sorrow-lit tools," "respectable ache," "luminous ache") that can feel aesthetically repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly specific ("Pewter does not rust, it remembers fingerprints"). The metaphors are fresh and serve the sci-fi/surreal premise without clutter. Line-level propulsion is strong, with no visible artifacts or padding.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is polished, it suffers from significant metaphor congestion; nearly every noun is modified or figurative (&quot;ladders lowering like rain,&quot; &quot;curing time,&quot; &quot;grief... like weather&quot;). This density creates a sluggish pace and occasionally obscures the physical action, violating the economy bias.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting, specifically an excessive density of similes (over 10 "like/as" constructions in a short space). This creates a "template cadence" artifact where momentum stalls for ornamentation, obscuring the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly evocative; the repetition in the "wheat" image serves a strong rhetorical purpose rather than reading as an artifact. Line-level craft is exceptional, with images like "dawn had leaned its blue shoulder" grounding the fantastical elements in physical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lush, high-density prose fits the aesthetic perfectly, though a few metaphor stacks ("comet hair," "fish in a bowl") border on overwriting. The rhythm propels the scene effectively despite the heavy adjectival load.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("vacancy shaped like a note that refuses to be born," "oil that smells of apples"). The rhythm supports the magical realism tone effectively. The final sentence ("tinkersong wonder blossomed") feels like a tacked-on summary rather than an organic image, slightly marring the otherwise strong finish.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition artifacts undermine the prose quality. The phrase "resonant hush" appears four times, and "hinged awakenings" three times, creating a distracting loop that feels like a checklist malfunctioning. While individual descriptions are often lovely ("spoon of black water"), these lexical stutters break immersion and lower the score significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.1)
    Line-level craft suffers from tautologies ("turbines in a turbine-hum reverie") and redundant phrasing ("rope remembers the memory"). Abstract prompt phrases ("timewoven alliances," "layered meanings") are inserted awkwardly, creating friction and opacity in the sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.4)
    Momentum is stalled by a high density of figurative language ("moon lifted her shoulder," "leaked away like milk") that feels ornamental rather than functional. The prose prioritizes poetic texture over narrative propulsion, leading to a sluggish pace.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. There are moments of overwriting where metaphors stack up or become self-conscious ("stepped from their shacks like parentheses," "truth was a muscle"), which momentarily distracts from the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high-impact imagery like "salt gathered into stillness" and "patient oval of fossil light." A few metaphors ("scattered lungs," "weather's lip") lean slightly abstract, but the overall rhythm and precision are publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    While grammatically clean, the prose suffers from a high density of similes ("teeth like moths," "like pebbles," "like courtroom hands") that occasionally crowd the narrative momentum. A reduction in figurative scaffolding would sharpen the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished and atmospheric, though it occasionally veers into "purple" density ("lambent readiness," "cork in velvet"). The insertion of prompt phrases like "furiously tranquil" and the explicit statement of motivation disrupt the otherwise smooth line-level rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "ropes hung like pale veins." While a few descriptions border on the ornamental ("bled gold"), the line-level craft generally heightens the atmospheric tension without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from high figurative density ("glittering grit," "bruise that remembers healing") that sometimes obscures meaning. The beauty of the lines occasionally stalls the momentum rather than advancing the action.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.2)
    While individual images are striking, the prose suffers from a severe template cadence artifact: the phrase "Through contextual clues" is used three times to launch sentences, acting as a repetitive scaffold for exposition. This creates a rhythmic loop that dulls the reading experience. The writing is also dense with abstract metaphors that occasionally clutter the action.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.2)
    While evocative, the prose suffers from simile saturation ("like bees," "like a moonchip," "like a missing tooth," "like a grounded comet"), creating a repetitive syntactic scaffold that drags momentum. The density of metaphor often draws attention to the writing itself rather than the scene. Line-level polish is high, but the "X like Y" construction is overused.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose is overwritten with high metaphor density ("gulls practice arguments," "air holds stillness like a cup") that obscures the action. The relentless figurative language creates a "burnished" surface that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and dense with sensory detail ("nut skin and crushed lightning"), but suffers from marked simile fatigue. The frequent use of "like" constructions ("like reed flutes," "like bells," "like whales," "like surf") creates a noticeable rhythmic scaffold that distracts from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and image-rich ("clouds combed the river"), but the density of metaphor occasionally slows momentum and veers into overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic ("wheels sainted with pollen"), showing high technical skill. However, the central conceit of nature-as-language (paragraphs, rosaries, syllable, sentence, dead languages, grammar, vows, ledger, psalm, annotates) is so relentless that it risks becoming a repetitive texture loop by the final third, slightly suffocating the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with strong images like "welding torch sound shy." Line-level craft is high, though a few abstract phrasings drift into opacity without grounding the image in the scene's physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from significant simile saturation ("like spare cutlery," "like a black rope," "like a lens," "like a catalog," "like wet cloth," "like mending it," "like a liturgy," etc.). This relentless "like [noun]" construction becomes a scaffold artifact that creates a repetitive cadence and draws attention to the writing rather than the scene. The density of figurative language obscures the clarity of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally lush and polished, but a few metaphors misfire, notably "wind scraped our faces like a patient file," which creates a confusing garden-path association (medical vs. tool). The repetition of "sacredly playful" and the slightly awkward "confession spill" detract from an otherwise high-quality texture.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally lyrical and polished, but the insertion of the required phrase "crisis actor real crisis survivor" lacks necessary punctuation, creating a syntactic stumble. Additionally, phrases like "nomadic penumbra" border on overwrought density.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes and personification ("like silvered mirrors," "like a choir," "like handwriting," "like lanterns," "like a coin"), creating a repetitive syntactic rhythm that feels overwrought. While individual images are evocative, the cumulative effect is a "scaffold" of figurative language that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("platinum shone like a moon pared down to its hardest clause"). Rhythm is well-managed, using the "metronome" of the thunder to pace the surgery. A few metaphors are slightly abstract, but they serve the magical realism well.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical density; nearly every sentence carries a figurative weight ("silence hammered on an anvil," "lullaby that remembered teeth"). While beautiful, this persistent elevation flattens the emotional peaks and risks burying the causal action under imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally evocative but marred by the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("quilts memories together," "kintsugi intentions") within a short space. These loops act as visible scaffold artifacts that disrupt the narrative flow and polish.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("spidered from my forehead," "took the wrongness by the sleeve"). Rhythm is well-calibrated to the contemplative pacing. There are no significant loops or artifacts; the imagery aligns with the marine/painterly lexicon throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("coughs like a door," "bone of longing"). However, the simile "angry birds" strikes a jarring, anachronistic note that disrupts the timeless atmosphere, and the metaphor density occasionally slows the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmically controlled, though the density of figurative language ("metal throat," "ghosts of circuits," "careful bone") occasionally borders on overwriting. The imagery is consistently strong, but the relentless poetic intensity in the opening beats slightly risks obscuring the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose has strong rhythm but suffers from metaphorical density and occasional mixed imagery ("soil still reasoned," "rational as rainfall"). The high volume of figurative language in a short space slightly dampens the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and evocative, though occasionally overwritten with high metaphor density ("breathe its tired white lung," "gaps are the letters"). The rhythm is strong, but some figurative language borders on purple, slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally polished, but the insertion of required phrases causes distinct artifacts. "As the creek rises" appears twice, creating jarring tense errors against the story's past tense (e.g., "hissed... as the creek rises"). The phrase "empirically intuitive" is repeated three times as a label, creating a noticeable scaffold that clutters the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the prose is polished, it suffers from metaphorical congestion ("corridors sighed," "grotto coughed," "filigree that weighed like threat") that slows narrative momentum. The density of figurative language in high-pressure beats obscures the physical action, prioritizing texture over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from simile overload, with over ten uses of &quot;like&quot; creating a repetitive, scaffoldy rhythm (&quot;like a patient heart,&quot; &quot;like water,&quot; &quot;like soup&quot;). Some metaphors are strained or confusing (&quot;like soup agreeing&quot; with a &quot;scald&quot;), reducing clarity in favor of aesthetic decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, though it occasionally suffers from metaphor density that threatens to stall momentum (e.g., "titles feel like paper boats," "jealousy is a magnet," "memories are all bent nails"). While the images are individually strong, the relentless figurative language sometimes creates a "muddle" effect that distances the reader from the immediate action. A slight pruning would let the best images shine brighter.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished but overly dense with figurative language ("stories pool," "rain learning to speak," "minutes sound like forgiveness"). The relentless metaphorical layering in every sentence slows momentum and draws attention to the writing rather than the scene. A lighter touch would allow the emotional beats to land with more impact.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic, matching the ceremony's pacing. However, a high density of "like" similes (librarians, islands, harbors, runes, rain) creates a slight scaffold effect that distances the imagery in moments of high density.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and lyrical, offering high information density and vivid imagery. A few metaphors lean toward the ornate ("leaves that refused to remember wind," "baton of silence"), bordering on preciousness, but the overall craft is precise. The rhythm supports the building tension of the ritual effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("light enough to be a wing"). Some phrasing verges on purple ("pressed like velvet against my ears"), and the "softcover dictionary" feels slightly jarringly modern against the ancient backdrop, though the line-level rhythm is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("blade of ink," "held note lodged in the throat"). There is high information density and strong rhythm. A minor slip in the penultimate paragraph ("pattern nested... tearing the nest") creates a slight repetitive echo, but the overall control is high.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is dense but suffers from "purple" overwriting that obscures clarity (e.g., "palms salted with spores that pulsed when nerves misfired"). High metaphorical density slows the narrative momentum in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished with high density and strong rhythm ("rain ticking," "pearls on a candle lantern"). A few metaphors feel slightly strained ("pulse that kept miscounting"), but the line-level craft is generally precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high metaphorical density ("clocks are unsure," "shook like a hung door") that occasionally slows momentum. A "template cadence" artifact appears in the sentence structures ("I unlock," "I keep," "I dialed," "I took"), creating a repetitive rhythm that dulls the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphor density ("gulls hinge silence," "lung learning itself") that sometimes obscures the image. The repetition of the phrase "proximate causes" and "covenant" feels slightly mechanical within the short word count.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from extreme metaphor density ("like roots," "like birds," "like pigeons," "like water finds slope"), creating a "purple" texture that distracts from the narrative momentum. This figurative overload violates the density check, as nearly every action is filtered through a simile.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is polished, it suffers from "simile drift," relying heavily on "like X" constructions (8+ instances, e.g., "like fog," "like a small moon," "like a path of dew"). The figurative density borders on purple ("tasted its grammar"), occasionally obscuring the action with poetic scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high-impact imagery ("spun like a moth against equations"). The writing balances technical constraint with poetic introspection without lapsing into purple prose or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from high-density metaphor stacking (four similes in the first three sentences), which clogs the rhythm and obscures clarity. Phrases like "knuckles knock like masts" and "gulls wing patterns that look suspiciously like vowels" strain credibility and lean into affectation rather than precise description.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and mixed metaphors ("desire computes trajectories even numbers envy," "mote a retired constellation auditing"). This density of abstract personification draws attention to the writing itself rather than the scene, impeding clarity and momentum during key discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is high, with inventive imagery like "drones drifted like drowsy moths" and "dryer clacking buttons like hail." The sensory details ("metallic and sweet, like a bitten coin swirled in honeyed tea") are vivid. A slight deduction for the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("quietly rebellious," "hush of the universe") which momentarily exposes the scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("pallets clicked like teeth," "ribbed dark") with strong rhythmic control. The technical descriptions of sound and metal are precise and avoid generic placeholders. There are no significant artifacts or loops, and the density of image supports the story's atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic, sustaining a high level of craft. A few metaphors border on the ornate ("face rose like a moon that had forgotten its own brightness"), but they generally serve the atmospheric consistency. The text avoids scaffold and maintains strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished but relies heavily on "noun of abstract noun" constructions ("twitch and rattle of thoughts," "metallic clink of ambition") and dense simile that borders on overwriting. The rhythm is smooth and fits the "hush" tone, but the relentless poeticizing dampens the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from extreme "simile fatigue," with "like" or "as" appearing in nearly every sentence ("like a giant oar," "like distant hearths," "like a mutinous compass," "like old poetry"). This repetitive syntactic scaffolding creates a drone that dulls the imagery's impact. The density of figurative language blocks narrative momentum and obscures the literal action.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-value imagery ("soft shrapnel," "citrus," "pale commas") that advances character and mood. The high density of figurative language is voice-motivated (the character is a performer narrating his life), creating a distinct texture without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is dense with imagery but suffers from repetition of ornate phrases ("lantern-moth hush," "aesthetically driven" both appear twice). The relentless metaphor density ("name stuck like pollen," "thin animal") occasionally clogs narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyrical prose is marred by the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "innocently cunning" as a static label, which reads as a generated artifact. While some imagery lands ("stitch wind to glass"), other moments veer into overwrought sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic, utilizing high-information imagery ("dust listens," "colors cut across their throats") to sustain the magical realist tone. A few phrasings verge on being overwrought, but the stylistic choices are largely purposeful and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is elegant ("dawn had been braided from patience") but suffers from high figurative density; nearly every sentence employs a simile or metaphor. This relentless poeticism sometimes obscures the physical action and slows momentum, marking it as slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.9)
    While mechanically polished, the prose suffers from simile density ("like tea leaves," "like constellations," "like sentences," "like a meteorologist") which dilutes immediacy. The recurrence of "as if" constructions (four distinct uses) creates a filtering artifact that distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is evocative and rich, but the density of figurative language is extremely high ("glittered like thunderheads caught in the throat of a bell"). While beautiful, the relentless metaphor stack in high-pressure beats occasionally threatens to obscure the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("storms queue like unplayed songs"). A few moments lean slightly toward the sentimental ("moths decided to become lanterns"), but the rhythm and density generally support the magical realism tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is overwritten, with a metaphor density that chokes the momentum. Lines like "tools glint like small comets trailing trust" and "motions that felt quietly vivid" mix abstract and concrete imagery in confusing ways. Pruning the figurative language would significantly sharpen the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and inventive ("sutures curve like a parenthesis"), though the density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("pain salts the floor with stars") borders on saturation. The aesthetic beauty is high, but slightly more directness in the physical climax would sharpen the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is rich but occasionally dense with stacked metaphors ("unpacks like envelopes," "urgency like wind") that slow momentum. The phrase "hushed thunder" appears three times (lines 1, 20, 29), and "unused love" four times; while intended as motifs, the repetition feels like a lexical loop that reduces freshness in a short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from high figurative density ("star-salted mantle," "shadowed rapture," "ate a comet of snow"), violating the overwriting check. The relentless metaphor stacking obscures the physical action and creates a monotonous rhythm that dulls the story's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is highly polished and rhythmic, though the density of figurative language ("manuscripts of rain," "lungs holding a necessary breath") occasionally borders on saturation. The technical execution remains strong, with no scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several distracting errors mar the otherwise elevated prose. A homophone error ("currants of sound" instead of "currents"), redundancy ("When I sleep, I translocate during sleep"), and slightly muddled imagery ("ungreased" bearings are usually unreliable; flowers opening "to and fro") break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, but simile density is excessive ("like thin shawls," "like a bruise," "like a shed snake skin," "like dew"), creating a repetitive syntactic cadence. This reliance on "X like Y" constructions stalls momentum in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally lush and precise ("parliament of sensation"), but the verbatim repetition of the long phrase "via the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase" and the "nerve regeneration" tag acts as a significant text artifact. These rote repetitions disrupt the otherwise sophisticated rhythm and signal forced integration.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is lush and imaginative, but the verbatim repetition of the specific phrase "regally unpretentious" for two different characters in such a short space reads as a prompt-insertion artifact or oversight. The density of metaphor is high, occasionally slowing momentum, but generally effective.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and high-density, propelling the narrative without drag. Line-level craft is strong, with only minor diction stumbles (e.g., "foxed" applied to a battery is an opaque choice) that do not mar the overall clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with evocative imagery like lights blooming "like algae on dark water." The score is held back by a tendency toward overwriting in the middle section, where dense figurative language ("every rusted bolt a performer") briefly slows narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythm ("Heat for eight breaths... turn and hum"). There are occasional lapses into overwrought metaphor ("ferns applauded") that blur the line between telepathy and pathetic fallacy, but line-level craft is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is high-density and evocative ("glass ribcage," "shutter catching light"). However, minor filter verbs ("she felt her body freeze," "she read tremor") distance the reader from the immediate sensation in key moments. Occasional phrasing veers into sentimentality ("making people taller inside themselves").

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmic ("rattled like a little heart"), though occasionally adjective-heavy ("crestfallen portrait artist"). "Fogbones" is a creative coinage, but the density of figurative language borders on overwriting in places.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("clock coughing sand," "orchestra of halted crescendos"), successfully sustaining a high-literary tone. The rhythm is controlled, though the metaphor density pushes the limit of clarity in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density (e.g., "slow commas," "kissed like steel," "like wolves," "like a courtroom"). This figurative clutter in high-pressure beats distracts from the action and creates a self-conscious texture.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythmic control ("glue is gone, and the hour is thin"). The imagery is consistent and fresh, though a few metaphors border on purple ("breath slows like a mare returning from heat"), they largely fit the established aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.9)
    While the imagery is lush, the integration of required phrases causes recurring grammatical faults (e.g., "he transliterates... until the hooks were"), disrupting the timeline. Additionally, the repetition of full epithets ("cool-headed fisher," "voicing silence") creates a mechanical, scaffolded rhythm that mars the prose flow.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density, violating the rubric's density check. Phrases like "smells like inked thunder" and "floor hums like a printing press" appear in nearly every sentence, clogging the pacing and obscuring the action with decorative scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is evocative and high-density ("thistle hiss," "lantern eyes"), creating a strong textural experience. However, the relentless lyricism occasionally threatens clarity, bordering on overwrought in moments like "insect is a metronome that never met time." The craftsmanship is undeniable, but the density of metaphor requires a slower reading pace.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from metaphor congestion, where figurative language crowds nearly every sentence ("breath rehearsed itself," "hush ripen," "seam," "tide"). This density sometimes obscures physical action and creates mixed metaphors (hush is a fruit, then a seam, then a tide) that dilute the imagery's precision. A firmer editorial hand could prune the figurative layering to let the strong core images shine.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and high-density, showing strong rhythmic control ("ordinary, ordinary, ordinary"). However, the metaphor density is high ("names will tremble like wet birds," "liturgy of order"), occasionally becoming ornamental rather than clarifying.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with strong rhythm and evocative imagery like "back door yawns toward the hedge maze." The synesthetic metaphors are bold ("taste like green brass hope") but consistent with the established voice rules. There are no significant artifacts or drag; every line advances the atmosphere or the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose density is high with no scaffolding or loops. The imagery is precise ("limp-clicking," "small, patient train"). The integration of the prompt phrase "willowglass" is a bit forced ("willowglass hope made mineral"), slightly disrupting the otherwise grounded semantic field, but the surrounding craft is polished.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative, though it occasionally lapses into metaphor stacking ("bright bruise of fear," "thermal bloom of longing") that can feel ornamental. The integration of required phrases is mostly smooth, though "factually mystical" reads slightly as a label. The rhythm serves the contemplative mood well, maintaining a steady, fluid momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and rich, but suffers from metaphor density that occasionally muddles the imagery (mixing sewing, time, sound, and weather metaphors rapidly). The line "The needle is us" explains the metaphor rather than letting the action carry the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and high-density, with strong rhythm and imagery. However, some metaphors border on strained or overwrought (e.g., "smiled like a bruise remembering its color," "sun had not yet learned to linger"), which momentarily draws attention away from the scene to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is lush and ambitious, often achieving beautiful precision ("bright as a small harbor moon"), but suffers from occasional figurative congestion. Images like "fog... over a gray throat" and "metronomes" holding their breath (which contradicts their function) create slight semantic friction that muddies the visual logic.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is dense with imagery but suffers from overwriting ("memory of bees seemed louder than wind," "freshwater hair"). A significant grammar error occurs with the required element: "As the day lengthened [past] and as chimney smoke flattens [present]..." creates a jarring tense shift. The repetition of the "chimney smoke" phrase is noticeable and clunky.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rhythmically strong and dense with imagery. Some metaphors verge on mixed or overwrought ("fog that has learned to listen," "moored mouth"), but the sensory details generally land well.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished and image-rich, with strong density and rhythm ("brittle awakenings," "facets"). A few metaphors feel slightly mixed or abstract ("fragile footage" in a fantasy context), but the line-level craft generally supports the ethereal tone without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor stacking ("ribbon glows like a secret," "temple emerged like a pupil," "auditioning to become a diagram"). The repetition of "prismatic quiet" and the use of abstract similes obscure clarity and violate the "read-aloud" test for naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("clock salts the hour," "thin frost across the noise floor"). The density occasionally risks opacity with abstract metaphors in close succession, but the rhythm is propulsive and the imagery is consistently fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative, but suffers from simile fatigue; constructions like "shadows... like spilt ink," "vault... like a hand," and "pipes... like silver birches" become repetitive. The heavy reliance on "verb like noun" imagery slows the pacing and distracts from the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.5)
    While there is some lovely sensory description ("slow alphabet on fabric"), the prose suffers from heavy repetition of required phrases and a weak, telling opening. The recurrence of "furrowed hush" and "unifying opposites" creates a scaffolded feel that detracts from line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally vivid ("intercom that coughs," "careful tremble"), but the forced insertion of the prompt phrase "nail from coffin" results in ungrammatical constructions ("carry her copper nail from coffin," "press the copper nail from coffin"). These missing articles disrupt the sentence rhythm and pull the reader out of the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.3)
    Figurative language density is too high, with metaphor strings ("ribbon through my ribs," "tightrope for thoughts") obscuring clarity. There is a notable redundancy in the "scaffold wrap" sentence, and the prose relies frequently on "as if" constructions to support its imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose density is high, with strong rhythm and evocative imagery ("soft rain on hot tar"). A few metaphors feel slightly overworked or stacked ("cheap motel of memory," "saints of paper"), verging on purple, but the overall propulsion is strong. The line-level craft successfully supports the story's meditative yet tense atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor opacity, exemplified by the confusing simile "sound came through the speakers like wet stone turning into wheat." The repetition of the compound adjective "daylily-pressed" and the density of pathetic fallacy ("light were trying to stay") clutter the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density. The density of figurative language is very high (multiple similes/metaphors per paragraph); while high-quality, it skirts the edge of overwriting, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is dense with figurative language ("marrow of the air," "storm milk") that often obscures physical causality in high-pressure beats. This "metaphor stacking" creates a purple texture that stalls narrative momentum, as the reader must decode the imagery rather than visualize the action.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative, achieving high information density with lines like "breathing architecture of memory and debt." While the metaphorical load is heavy and risks being "purple" (e.g., "tarry syllables"), the rhythm is controlled and the imagery remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose density is high, with strong metaphors ("coffee old enough to have a pension," "railing across an inner ravine"). The mandatory insertion of prompt phrases ("confidently uncertain," "insulating emotionally with facts") creates slight diagnostic artifacts, but the surrounding text supports them with concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in lines like "tasting the absence where her voice used to rest." The score is held back slightly by the filter verb stack in the resolution ("I understand now," "I translate the pulse") which distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is lush and rhythmically controlled, but suffers from metaphor density that occasionally obscures meaning ("feathers of history slipping through definitions"). Some images border on purple ("barnacles of memory," "frost of questions"), creating a "poetic soup" that slows momentum. Despite this, the line-level craft is high-quality and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is dense with imagery and technically proficient, though it occasionally tips into purple territory with phrases like "grit of grief" or "tone too low for names." The integration of required phrasing ("heartbeat of a hesitation") is grammatically smooth but stylistically conspicuous; however, the rhythm generally supports the "resonant hush" tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the prose is polished and evocative, there is a heavy reliance on simile ("like river scale," "like dragon teeth," "like a confession," "like a rib cage") that creates a filter during high-pressure beats. This figurative density occasionally stalls momentum in the climax, working against the protagonist's stated goal of stripping away "fable" for "blunt" truth.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally dense with metaphors that obscure rather than clarify (e.g., "planks of calibrated delay," "perfumed with fog"). While the imagery is often striking, the reliance on abstract descriptors ("structure of meaning," "ghosts of certainty") sometimes slows the momentum. The line-level craft is strong, but a few "tell-y" explanations of the mechanic dampen the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from "purple" opacity in peak beats (e.g., "frowns like weather learning itself," "cold as confession"). There are verbatim repetitions of prompt phrases ("weigh a dream against an empire," "mulberry ache") that read as loops rather than organic echoes. These artifacts drag on the otherwise strong momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density ("braid had grayed like frost"). The imagery is inventive and avoids cliché, though the density of adjectives in the opening ("luminous," "unbreathing," "radiant") skirts the edge of overwriting before settling into a strong flow.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished with high information density and strong imagery ("crescents I press into the rims look like shells"). The prose rhythm supports the meditative tone without succumbing to repetitive sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and evocative, though the opening paragraph is dense with figurative language (e.g., "gull pretends to be a thought"). The craft stabilizes into excellent clarity during the active method beats, balancing the poetic with the concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a high density of similes ("like listeners," "like unwrinkled paper," "like a book") that clutter the imagery. The repetition of "sycamore hush" as a bookend feels forced rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    While evocative, the prose suffers from extreme metaphorical density ("sainted margin," "cruel accordion," "spines the world") that occasionally clogs the reading flow. The rapid shifting of metaphor vehicles—from accounting to music to shepherding to writing—creates a "mixed metaphor" effect that dulls the sharpness of the imagery. The rhythm is strong, but the text needs breathing room.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative with high momentum; images like "wind like a flute note perfectly off center" are striking. A slight deduction for the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases (e.g., "brilliant dimness" and "lingering luminance" appearing repeatedly as fixed noun phrases), which feels like a minor scaffold artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and fresh figurative language ("soft-spoken stars with errands"). The prose creates a strong rhythmic propulsion that fits the "meteor hush" tone perfectly, with no significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong rhythmic control ("collided, spin, and stop") that supports the ritualistic tone. Figurative language is occasionally heavy ("stellar doubt threads everything like the echo of burned chimes"), bordering on abstraction, but remains effective.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density ("locked drawer opened with a spoon"). However, the density of figurative language is high throughout, occasionally bordering on overwrought (e.g., "apology stuck under the tongue of time," "grief leans in to listen"). A slightly lighter touch in the setup would have made the peak imagery pop even more.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is often exquisite ("shapes like ink in water"), but the score is capped due to the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("earnestly naive," "understanding dripping rates") in close proximity. These repetitions read as visible scaffolding rather than organic motifs, slightly marring an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often beautiful but suffers from metaphor density that obscures clarity (e.g., "moth wing of glassless memory," "buckets of silence"). These heavy figurative constructions draw attention to the writing itself rather than the experience, slowing narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and high metaphor density ("flame whisper," "refracted shade," "turning noon into a slow prism") that stifles momentum. While individual images are striking, their relentless frequency triggers the density penalty, resulting in a static, decorative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong sentence variety that modulates the pacing during the crisis. Imagery is vivid ("glints where the moon underruns the leaves") and functional, serving the atmosphere without obstructing the clarity of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is rhythmically strong and highly polished, with striking imagery ("shear silk from stone"). However, the density of figurative language is relentless ("tidal alphabet," "sipped polarity"), occasionally obscuring the physical action and creating a layer of abstraction that competes with narrative clarity in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with dense metaphor ("puzzles like weather systems," "dim patience"). The inclusion of required phrases sometimes feels mechanical, disrupting the otherwise smooth rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and no scaffold loops. Images like "bent like a bowed tree over a grave" and the tuning fork "waiting on the sill like a sliver of midnight" serve the atmosphere without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentence-level craft is dense and imaginative ("claws inked," "sundial... where noon was a rumor"). The prose maintains high momentum without scaffold or cliché, successfully balancing heavy imagery with narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is lush but frequently overwrought ("wind tasted of... unanswered questions"), drifting into abstraction. A visible tense error ("This was the minute when the penny drops") disrupts the flow at a critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and high-density, though the relentless figurative language ("gossip lost its footing," "pulse stepped back") occasionally threatens to crowd the physical action in high-pressure beats. A few metaphors feel slightly thick, but the rhythmic control is compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("glass clear as gull bones"), though the frequency of metaphorical constructions approaches saturation in the middle section. The rhythm remains strong, propelling the reader through the dream logic without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose density is high and purposeful, with strong imagery ("silence like a chair," "throat learning a new language"). The rhythm supports the "careful metronome" of the protagonist's mind, though the adjectival density is nearly at the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose quality is very high, with dense, evocative imagery ("latitudes of shadow flowing like kelp," "etched like cuttlefish bones"). The rhythm of the sentences mimics the "held breath" of the city, creating a strong atmospheric effect. A few metaphors border on the dense side ("refractions knife"), but they serve the alien geometry concept well and do not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong and evocative ("biology becomes memory"), but high-pressure moments sometimes suffer from overwrought metaphors. The simile "folding concern around greed like tissue paper around a brick" is clunky and distracting during a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and zero scaffold artifacts. Images like the walkway peeling free "like a secret tongue" and the gold fleck turning "like a pale fish" are fresh, sensory, and strictly purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is density-rich but suffers from metaphor overcrowding ("pearl on the tongue," "shadow stitched from clerks," "metronome for mercy"). This heavy figuration sometimes obscures the literal action and creates a barrier to immediacy, reading as overwritten in places.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("chipped heart glittering like a stutter"), showing high technical skill. A few images verge on being slightly overwrought ("lightning had licked"), but the overall precision and lack of filler justify the stylistic density.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. A few metaphors ("unstitched gravity") are slightly heavy, but the "sedimentality" pun is a brilliant, diegetic use of language.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.5)
    Metaphor density is extremely high ("fog stitched ladders," "recruiting spider silk," "gears pretended"), occasionally obscuring the physical action. The prose is polished but borders on "purple" and overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and polished, with high-quality imagery like the "inside of a sea bottle." The rhythm is controlled, and line-level craft is excellent, supporting the fable-like tone without becoming overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.9)
    While the line-level crafting is competent, the prose suffers from significant repetition of prompt phrases ("misting hush," "whispering gleam," "inside the chime of wind bells") which act as jarring refrains in such a short space. Some metaphors are strained, and the reliance on "tell" phrasing for the prompt elements disrupts the immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythmic control ("shelved the silence back into a sonnet"). At times, the figurative language borders on precious ("constellations of murmurs," "slot as thin as a lost idea"), risking abstraction over clarity. However, the line-level craft generally supports the magical realist tone with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. While beautiful, the metaphorical density occasionally verges on overwrought (e.g., "sky thinned to a bruise that forgives nothing"), threatening to obscure the literal action in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and dense, though occasionally overwrought with pathetic fallacy ("tooth remembered a silence") that risks purple prose. The writing is technically sound, but the tendency to explain the metaphor ("shyness had taught him patience") reduces line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("consonants snap like fish," "barnacle tenors"), demonstrating high craft. While the figurative density borders on overwrought in a few places ("crisp nostalgia cuts the water like peppermint"), the consistency of the voice justifies the stylization without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense with successful, high-impact imagery ("black as handwriting," "expression like flint and rain"). The rhythm is sophisticated, and the sentence structures vary effectively to control pacing. There are no visible artifacts or scaffold sentences; every line serves to advance the atmosphere or action.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from extreme overwriting, with nearly every sentence carrying a metaphor or personification ("moss closed its starry mouths," "shadows huddled"). This density violates the rubric's clarity standards, obscuring physical action beneath a layer of ornamental poeticism.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative, though occasionally the metaphorical weight teeters on overwrought (e.g., "tremor is a kind of music," "thank you is a tide"). While the "eyes of the sea at noon" is a slight cliché in an otherwise fresh text, the line-level craft generally supports the story's dreamlike logic with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically strong, with high information density. A few metaphors feel slightly mixed or strained (e.g., "archives like recipes, each flavor tagged with a neighbor"), but the overall texture is sophisticated and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is high-density and evocative ("knot remembered it had edges," "sentence... stretched across the tape like a sail ripping"). Rhythm is excellent. Minor deduction for occasional overwriting ("grief made its proofs in salt") that borders on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("glinting like a coin minted for rain"), but the metaphor density is very high, bordering on overwriting. The relentless figurative language slows momentum, though it avoids mechanical loops or scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("cage creaking like a winter throat"), with excellent rhythmic control. The phrase "burst into error and lace" is a bold, slightly abstract risk that pays off in this fable-like mode.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in lines like "tether kissed an edge of wind." The rhythm supports the floating, dreamlike quality of the narrative. There are no scaffold artifacts or loops; the imagery is functional and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.5)
    Figurative language density is excessive, tripping the "overwriting" check. The reliance on simile ("like pollen," "like rain," "like tides," "like a held oath") creates a repetitive rhythmic scaffold that clogs momentum. Pruning the metaphorical clutter would allow the strong underlying imagery to breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is weighed down by an excessive density of similes ("like a friendly innkeeper," "like a baker," "like a skipped stone," "like silk," "like a promise," "like tea"). This reliance on "like/as if" constructions creates a repetitive cadence and stylistic clutter that distracts from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, suffering from metaphor density that impedes clarity ("hush that felt like driftwood nostalgia," "oil that remembers ship decks"). The relentless personification ("maps breathed," "frost listened") creates a twee texture that undermines the gravity of the repair.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished but repetitive in structure, with many paragraphs opening on a "We [verb]" template that creates a droning cadence. While imagery is dense, some metaphors ("dew could not swallow," "woolen body") border on overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("unknots its fist," "light unfurls in ribbons"). The mandatory phrase "pane of hush" appears three times, and "bruised awe" twice, which creates a slight repetitive artifact that drags on the otherwise polished flow. A few metaphors (time unknotting a fist) border on mixed, but the overall craft is high.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density ("rust resents salt"). However, the frequency of simile constructions ("like ribs," "like keyholes," "like a breath," "like penitent children") creates a slight scaffold artifact that draws attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from severe "simile churn," with nearly every sentence utilizing a "like" or "as" construction (e.g., "like nerves," "like a metronome," "like winter," "like muscle"). This creates a repetitive template cadence that stalls momentum and dilutes the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and highly polished; phrases like "heavy with unread sugar" and "clung to her wrist like barnacles" create a distinct textural signature. Information density is high, with no visible scaffolding or loops. The prompt phrases are integrated smoothly into the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose density and imagery are generally high quality ("filigrees that remembered vanished seas"). However, the verbatim repetition of the clunky phrase "emotionally contagious through touch" (likely a prompt requirement) disrupts the rhythm and reads as an artificial insertion, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from extreme metaphorical density; nearly every noun is paired with a simile ("voice folded a room," "gears pricking like ears," "faces lit... like a frost ringed moon"). This overwriting creates a "purple" haze that obscures the action and slows narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.5)
    Significant looping artifacts damage the flow; phrases like "quaking reverie," "period of profound transformation," and "helix-minded" are repeated almost verbatim. This creates a checklist-like scaffold that stalls momentum and draws attention to the writing's construction.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from the verbatim repetition of long prompt phrases (e.g., "clandestinely luminous," "through threshold effects," "forgotten combinations") within a short word count. This creates a "template cadence" and awkward syntax (e.g., "spores clandestinely luminous") that disrupts flow and creates heavy line-level debt.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished, though metaphor density is high ("froze like a staggered chord"). Occasional meta-commentary ("placing weight as a sentence places commas") briefly disrupts the immersive frame.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and evocative ("needle drooped like a tulip"), but the density of metaphor sometimes slows momentum ("lantern a small doctrine"). The writing is high-quality but risks becoming overwrought, prioritizing poetic effect over clarity in the mechanics of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but suffers from a density of figurative language that borders on overwriting. The frequency of similes ("like stage curtains," "like violin cases," "like a dancer," "like a bell," "like a stubborn throat") creates a "scaffold" of comparison that occasionally stifles the immediate reality of the scene. The constant metaphoric layer distances the reader from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is frequently overwritten with mixed or abstract metaphors ("decisions leaned like sunbeams," "lined with cloth and nerves") that obscure meaning. The register drift in "journalized" disrupts the tone, and the density of figurative language often impedes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("stitched little ladders," "hollow as gourds"). At times, the figurative language verges on precious or abstract ("bright as stubborn noon"), which slightly distances the reader from the physical action. However, the rhythm is strong, and the line-level craft effectively supports the mythic atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("ribboned telltales," "soot V"), mixing technical detail with strong imagery. A few phrases veer into overwriting ("gulls draw gray commas," "ink slightly salted"), but the information density and rhythm remain high.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is overwritten and suffers from a high density of "X of Y" genitive metaphors ("finger bone of light," "fossil of song," "lantern of dust," "ribbons of light," "cat of light"). This prepositional pile-up creates a monotonous texture and occasionally obscures clarity (e.g., whether the "finger bone" is a literal object or a light beam). The imagery is beautiful in isolation but cloying in aggregate.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("mist stitched the Thunder-echo range"), but the verbatim repetition of specific phrases ("harvest insights from failure," "avalanchingly quiet") creates a noticeable scaffold effect. These repetitions slightly disrupt the otherwise polished lyrical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.1)
    While the imagery is evocative, the prose relies heavily on a repetitive simile scaffold ("hinged like a press bed," "breath like an equation," "swept like weather"). This syntactic monotony flattens the rhythm and draws attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong and polished. While there are moments of high-quality imagery ("smiles like a person looking past a window"), some similes feel standard ("blooms like a thawed spring"), and the density of metaphor occasionally slows the narrative momentum without adding new information.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from "simile churn," with nearly 20 uses of "like" or "as if" in a short space, creating a repetitive syntactic texture that drags on momentum. While individual images are lovely, the reliance on comparison over direct assertion dilutes the immediacy of the "shift" in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.3)
    While the imagery is often striking ("edges were knives... soft knives"), the prose is marred by the clumsy adjectival cluster "stoically sparkling," which appears three times and anthropomorphizes an object distractingly. The verbatim repetition of the "hush of time's unraveling tapestry" line feels more like a structural crutch than a resonant refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose has strong rhythm and imagery, but suffers from a capitalization artifact ("Deliberate in breathing") that signals a forced prompt insertion. High metaphor density in action beats occasionally slows the pacing and obscures immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("shard hums like captive summer"). The figurative language is lush but functional within the established voice; occasional metaphors border on the abstract ("silence aches with mass") but fit the dream-logic tone. The technical execution is polished with no distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high metaphor density in the climax ("cursive," "teeth," "rookery," "daring"), creating a "purple" effect that distracts from the physical action of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is generally exquisite with high information density (“grain of ink shaped like tide lines”). However, reusing the simile vehicle “like a child” for both the wind and the wick within a short span (lines 25 and 36) is a visible repetition that mars the otherwise precise imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("tasted of stone and noon"), though occasionally tautological ("valley" repeated in "air above the valley held a valley-mist wonder") or slightly repetitive with verbs ("drag of wind," "light dragged"). These minor artifacts do not obscure meaning but slightly mar the otherwise high polish.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and rhythmically sophisticated ("hummed like a tuned shell," "bitten by rust"). While high-density metaphors ("clogged drain of stars") occasionally risk arresting momentum, the line-level craft is exceptional. The text avoids scaffold and loops, maintaining high propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and high-density, though it occasionally veers into overwrought territory ("shrugging from glass," "unbuttoning" frost). The repetition of "swaddle" is noticeable but functional given the prompt requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density ("hummed like soft bees," "lamps like small moons," "tasted of paper"). The relentless figurative language draws attention to the author's hand and slows momentum, obscuring the scene's reality under layers of poetic ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally lush and evocative ("braided the street," "flags of patience"), but suffers from visible seams where prompt elements are inserted verbatim (e.g., "bread from vanished bakery" missing a determiner). Additionally, some metaphors feel slightly decorative or strained, reducing the density of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. A single minor artifact ("hum-laughed") and a tendency toward heavy adjective-noun pairing slightly check the flow, but the craft is otherwise pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, though occasionally slips into slight over-attribution or mixed metaphor (e.g., a buckle "clenched without breath" attributes muscular agency to an object; "negotiating with a mirror" is logically slippery). These are minor flaws in an otherwise highly polished text.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high and imagery is often striking ("dull as a bottlecap"), but some metaphors strain for effect ("sky glanced down like an old recorder," "rain soldered along her lashes"). The phrase "terrestrially cosmic" appears twice, feeling slightly repetitive and clunky as a descriptor.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative with a strong rhythmic control that matches the story's emotional arc. The phrase "auroral sorrow" is effective but its repetition in a short space feels slightly mechanical. Line-level craft is otherwise high, with no significant artifacts or scaffold sentences disrupting the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density. A few metaphors border on overwrought ("tongues bitten too long"), and the specific prompt phrasing "shredded treasure map" clashes slightly with the otherwise sophisticated tone, but the craft is generally high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but leans heavily on abstraction and "purple" metaphor ("grief he had called posture," "stories curdled") that tells rather than shows. While the imagery is often beautiful, the density of figurative language sometimes obscures the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density ("yellow teeth nibbling paths"). Line-level craft is exceptional, avoiding artifacts and maintaining a distinct textural signature that reinforces the "organic machine" motif throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and strained metaphors ("click like a teardrop touching wood," "sandstorm calm"). These poetic artifacts obscure clarity and physical logic. The prompt phrases are inserted verbatim, creating jarring textural breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is severely marred by the verbatim repetition of specific phrases ("as a spider spins its web" x4, "calm defiance" x3, "hangman's dice" x4) within a short word count. These "text loops" break immersion and read like forced constraint insertions rather than organic writing.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and highly evocative, with high information density in lines like "geometry hatch from water" and "air combed by linen." The imagery is fresh and purposeful, avoiding scaffold loops; the rhythm supports the building tension without becoming monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is rhythmically polished but suffers from abstraction and "purple" tendencies (e.g., "terrestrially cosmic," "lattice of almosts," "relearned its thought"). While the imagery is vivid, the density of personification and metaphor sometimes obscures the physical reality of the scene. The "template cadence" of verb-heavy descriptions occasionally drags the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is lush but suffers from significant overwriting; nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or simile ("breathed like a library," "stitched quick seams," "threading steam," "setting type," "unspoken surname"). This density (figurative language in almost every line) clogs the rhythm and obscures the scene's physical action. The beauty of individual phrases is diminished by the lack of breathing room between images.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("fragrant shrapnel," "winter of sirens") without stalling momentum. While the imagery is strong, there is a slight tendency toward repetitive "I [verb]" sentence structures that risks rhythmic monotony in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically strong, with striking imagery ("stalactites sharpened the silence," "moon unstitched the aurora"). While the density of metaphor is high, it suits the magical realism tone; however, the reliance on personification ("decree sighed," "marble whispered") is frequent. The technical execution is otherwise flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.1)
    Recurring tense inconsistencies disrupt the timeline and sentence logic (e.g., mixing "stretched," "hums," and "felt" in one sequence). Prompt phrases are pasted in verbatim without adapting them to the story's syntax or register, creating jarring prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose contains striking images ("bruise under my tongue"), the text suffers from significant repetition and scaffold artifacts. Key phrases ("borrowed starlight," "windows of connection," "cameo appearance") appear multiple times as identical strings, creating a "checklist" texture that undermines the otherwise high polish.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful ("echoes thinned into the marsh like silk"), but suffers from high figurative density that occasionally slows momentum. The required phrase "scintillatingly somber" is integrated grammatically but feels ornamental and synesthetically heavy. The rhythm is generally strong, though some descriptions border on overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose density is high with arresting, original imagery ("cataract catching a star," "leaves like polished armor") that serves the tone perfectly. The rhythm is propulsive with no visible scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe artifacting due to the forced repetition of multi-word phrases (e.g., "variant allegiance" 4x, "fragmented radio frequencies" 3x) creates a jarring, checklist-like cadence. Additionally, the tone is told ("gritty whimsy") rather than shown, and the prose occasionally drifts into purple abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is evocative and rich ("crank stiff as a stitched wound"), but occasionally the figurative density ("lightning wrote its crooked essay," "meanings chose them like perch") feels overwrought, drawing attention to the author's hand rather than the image itself.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-impact imagery ("desire clipped to bone," "throat clearing to speak"). The line-level craft is exceptional, though the metaphorical density occasionally borders on overwrought ("smile had the pallor of a net"), preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical density and repetition, particularly the recurring motif of "breath" (lake holds breath, breath in the machine, breath in margins, breath ceases feuds). Some imagery, like "breath written in the margins," strains for poetic effect at the expense of clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the imagery is often striking, the text suffers from repetitive artifacts ("reverberate" appears three times; "fortified vulnerability" and "entangled memories" twice). These loops within a short space clutter the prose and feel like checklist insertions.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic but suffers from overwriting and mixed metaphors that blur clarity. Phrases like "shaped like the idea of mercy" are abstract, and "hush seemed to glow... like theater lights" confuses auditory and visual imagery. The reliance on heavy figurative language in nearly every sentence occasionally stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is dense with imagery, occasionally crossing into overwriting ("pickled thunder," "insolent math," "hiccuped in petaled ripples"). The repetition of "hiccuped" and "thunder" within a short space acts as a minor artifact, and the relentless metaphor density sometimes slows propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythmic propulsion. Phrases like "deletion was dispersion, a tidy myth" and "smells like dry rain" do heavy lifting without feeling ornamental. The technical lexicon ("damper racks," "topologies") blends seamlessly with the poetic imagery, maintaining clarity even in the abstract "Sargasso" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense and image-rich, with strong phrasing like "gathered ridicule like tinder" and "rehearsed its slow departure." A few moments verge on purple ("shadow-laced," "histories that disliked daylight"), creating a slight scaffold of abstraction. Generally, the line-level craft supports the magical realist tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is severely hampered by "simile churn"—there are over 15 "like" comparisons in a short text ("like a breath," "like a metronome," "like confetti," "like slow animals," etc.). This creates a distractingly repetitive template cadence that muffles the story's otherwise strong imagery and reduces line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose density is high with strong imagery ("stains my thumb like a small, instructive lightning"). Flow is generally excellent, though marred slightly by the awkward syntactic integration of required prompt phrases which disrupt the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the prose is polished, it occasionally suffers from density and mixed metaphors (e.g., "architecture sketching silence with patience and salt") that obscure clarity. A tense error in the insertion of a prompt phrase ("came... after the prophet arrives") also mars the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is high-density and rhythmically controlled, with strong imagery ("faces bloomed in grayscale," "bent like swallows"). There is a tendency toward slightly precious metaphors ("pinned themselves to light"), but the line-level craft is generally solid and propulsive. No major artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("hush settled like morning dust"), though some metaphors border on synesthetic abstractions that risk clarity ("shards glinted with footsteps"). The required phrase "sonically reflective" is repeated three times, which feels slightly mechanical against the otherwise seamless flow. Rhythm and cadence are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    While the imagery is evocative, the prose suffers from "simile churn"—a repetitive reliance on "verb like noun" or "adjective as noun" constructions (e.g., "patient as an ear," "heavy as guilt," "unblinking as a buoy"). This template cadence draws attention to the writing itself, slightly distancing the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwriting and forced synesthesia ("tastes like luminous ache," "silver sips of movement"). These flourishes often obscure the action rather than clarifying it, prioritizing sound over sense in a way that clogs the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    While there is strong imagery ("gulls carving the fog"), the prose is marred by the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("scent of hope" x3, "pulsing stillness" x2) which feels mechanical. The final paragraph becomes a checklist of abstract concepts, disrupting the narrative flow with telling rather than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative with high information density; metaphors like "gears ratcheting like rain" serve the steampunk/fantasy aesthetic perfectly. There are no wasted lines or rhythmic loops; the text propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and image-rich, though it occasionally tilts into purple territory ("patient than mud drying in balance"). The density of metaphor sometimes slows momentum, but the mechanics of the "bone setting" scenes are rendered with tactile precision.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.5)
    Overwriting frequently obscures clarity ("zephyr bloom of patience," "bright as sleep"); mixed metaphors ("wet nerve of the wall") and dense figurative language stall momentum and create an artificial texture.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphor density that occasionally slows momentum. A notable artifact is the repetition of the "metronome" simile (pendant as "tender metronome," Miri nods "like a metronome") within a short span, which breaks immersion. The prompt word "proffer" also repeats noticeably.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    While mechanically clean, the prose suffers from relentless metaphorical density (e.g., "paper breathed," "vines wrote cursive," "wolves of ink" in close succession). This "figurative muddle" slows momentum and draws attention to the writing itself rather than the scene, triggering a density deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is suffocated by figurative density ("breath braided," "grinned like dawn," "light combed"), violating the overwriting check. The relentless metaphor use obscures the action and creates a sentimental texture that lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Imagery is often striking ("pulse that the plate swallowed"), but the prose suffers from occasional awkwardness, most notably the "demonstrates patience physically" sentence, which reads like an unintegrated prompt insertion. Some descriptions border on purple ("moving stillness that carried more memory").

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, avoiding empty scaffolding while delivering evocative imagery ("bird that had learned to imitate chains"). There are no significant loops or artifacts, though the sentence structures occasionally fall into a repetitive "I [verb]" pattern during the procedural beats. The line-level craft successfully sustains the magical realist tone.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.5)
    Several moments of overwriting mar the prose, notably the personification where seams "licked back" and the clunky, prompt-forced adverbial construction "boundary-lessly trapped." These artifacts disrupt the rhythmic flow and draw attention to the writing mechanics rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.3)
    While rhythmically strong, the prose suffers from mixed or opaque metaphors like "scent dry and green as unfinished thunder." The repetitive "She thinks of..." structure near the end creates a scaffolded list effect that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from metaphorical density that occasionally obscures clarity or leans into cliché ("silence has weight," "song stripped to bones"). Some imagery is mixed or awkward, such as stillness that "tickles the ears like dust" or the ghost speaking "with her mouth." These artifacts slow the reading momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("ribs of the concourse groan"), but occasionally drifts into overwriting with high metaphor density ("math is a prayer"). The rhythm is good, though the relentless poeticism softens the mechanical reality of the engineering task.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush and evocative ("clocks slept like cats"), but the explicit insertion of the phrase "petrichor nostalgia" reads as a clumsy label rather than an organic description. The repetition of the modifier "excruciatingly gentle" also detracts slightly from the otherwise high-density writing.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("calendar of hunger fluttering in place"), maintaining a high density of image and meaning. A few metaphors border on the abstract or anthropomorphic ("windows woke like startled conscience"), but the line-level craft generally supports the story's legendary tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density in the descriptions of the knots. However, a few stock comparisons ("coiled like a sleeping serpent," "scattered like gulls") detract from the otherwise fresh imagery ("syllables of salt," "listening bone"). These clichés prevent the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from simile fatigue, with eight distinct "like [noun]" constructions in a short space ("like hinges," "like owls," "like soldiers"), creating a repetitive cadence. Additionally, the phrase "projecting presence" is repeated four times as a mechanical tag, disrupting the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high metaphorical density; nearly every sentence carries a simile or personification ("heart learning," "rain rehearsing"), which occasionally threatens to obscure clarity. The rhythm is strong, but the relentless figurative language borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the imagery is often beautiful, the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("unyielding compassion," "gracefully alert," "kelp-drift peace") feels artificial and disrupts immersion. Some metaphors feel slightly overwritten or mixed.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.3)
    Imagery is often strong ("gummed with pitch," "breath behind ice"), but prompt-mandated phrases like "realistically imaginative" feel clunky and inserted. Some repetition of key phrases ("sidereal patience," "defiant hush") slightly dulls the prose texture.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    Metaphor density is extremely high ("expression fractures into rain," "numbers becoming weather"), often obscuring clarity for the sake of poetic texture. Additionally, two required phrases are repeated verbatim ("approximates infinity," "quiet sigh of falling petals"), creating noticeable text loops.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and dense, though metaphors occasionally clash or strain (e.g., "silence itself were anvil and balm," "punctuation had traveled through their thin bones"). The repetition of "thundering calm" works as a frame but the oxymoron itself is slightly clunky.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. Phrasing like "apologies curdle on tongues" and "quick spit of weather" demonstrates mastery of line-level craft that enhances rather than distracts from the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is textured and rhythmic but suffers from metaphorical density that occasionally obscures meaning ("thunderhead of chess moves"). Some images clash semantically ("blithe as a bell in fog"—bells in fog usually signal danger, not carefreeness), reducing precision.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, though occasionally overwrought ("anxious need glittering harder than the stars"). The integration of prompt phrases like "groundedly imaginative" feels forced and disrupts the sentence flow.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from high metaphor density that occasionally impedes momentum (e.g., "glow salted the mist with patient, sea-green arithmetic"). While the lyrical style is established early, the frequency of figurative language per sentence risks overwriting and triggers the rubric's density penalty, creating a texture that is sometimes more perfumed than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose demonstrates high competence but suffers from excessive figurative density (e.g., "air tastes like slate," "truth is a basket," "grief was a table setting"). This relentless metaphorical layering slows the narrative momentum and creates a texture that feels overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density ("sun scrapes it into an abrasive calm"). However, the density of figurative language—specifically personification ("tide argues," "time bites," "clocks listen," "vault failed politely")—borders on overwriting and risks distancing the reader from the physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished but marred by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("denote" appears three times, "traveled stillness" twice), creating a checklist artifact effect. Some imagery creates density issues that slow momentum ("ghostly trains and kitchens").

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is overly dense with similes and metaphors ("hinges cried like old gulls," "listen like a pot simmers," "glinting like a dark tear"), creating a purple texture that slows reading speed. The climax relies on abstract lists ("salt of grief, acid of joy") rather than concrete, grounded imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("words tasted like something sweet a hive might save," "clocks that still tick in burned houses"). Imagery is consistently fresh and tactile. Rhythm creates a suitable sense of wonder without becoming purple.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("salt wicks," "matte and pale as ground moon"). However, prompt collision causes lexical repetition of "hush" (hushed blaze, shard of hush, hush in the vial), and the personification "streetlights daydream" feels slightly twee and repetitive as a bookend. The label "creeping normality noticer" is a clunky artifact that disrupts the otherwise smooth syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is lush and high-density, with strong sonic qualities. However, some metaphors border on the unintelligible ("tide hears me think like a choir of rust") or rely on abstract nouns performing physical actions, creating a slight barrier to clarity in the service of style.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose density is high, with phrases like "topology of vows and remainders" doing heavy lifting to marry concept and emotion. Rhythm is propulsive, mirroring the climb, and the line-level craft avoids the common pitfalls of abstract fiction by rooting metaphors in tactile imagery. No significant artifacts or loops; the language is polished and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is evocative with high information density ("drank light instead of ink"). A slight rhythmic monotony emerges during the middle sequence of visitors (Subject-Verb repetition), but the line-level craft remains polished and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("moths sleeping inside painted cocoons"), successfully sustaining a fable-like tone. A few phrasings lean toward "noun-of-noun" abstraction ("ceiling of our days"), but the imagery generally lands with precision and beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("gulls become sketches," "ice remembering a river"). Metaphors are fresh and serve the drive lens, reinforcing the deconstruction of time. A few phrases ("initiate the reversal") are slightly utilitarian compared to the surrounding poetry, but the overall craft is high-caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("graceful as mildew"), but suffers from repetitive phrasing of prompt elements ("lingering luminance" and "paradoxical notes" appear frequently with identical wording). This repetition creates a slight scaffold effect that drags on the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is superb, with high information density and evocative imagery ("seeds inside tapping their cages"). The prose maintains a strong rhythmic propulsion that mirrors the musical subject matter. There are no significant loops or artifacts; the technical terms required by the prompt (fractal generating) are woven in with relative smoothness. The sensory details appeal to sound and touch effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is lush and high-density, with evocative imagery that serves the story's focus on patterns and perception. While the density of similes is high, they are consistently fresh and character-specific ("spine admitting it has been carrying too much"), avoiding cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.8)
    A severe generation artifact ("Tone: None for the first telling") appears mid-sentence, shattering narrative immersion and disrupting the climax. The prose is otherwise functional but leans toward purple metaphor that occasionally obscures action.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose suffers from severe metaphor density; nearly every noun is paired with a simile ("like teeth," "like bees," "like suns," "like thoughts"), creating a "simile storm" that obscures the scene. This relentless ornamentation violates the density check, reducing clarity and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density in every sentence. Imagery such as "spines furred with salt" and "silt settled like thinking" performs double duty, advancing atmosphere and character interiority simultaneously without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is lush and imaginative but suffers from high metaphor density that occasionally obscures the action ("wind slices the bells into ribbons," "dress in ache"). While the imagery is beautiful, the relentless figurative language slows momentum and risks purple prose in peak beats. Greater starkness in the climax would have heightened the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("unwilling to be a weapon"). However, the metaphor density is very high ("maps fade like phosphors after a kiss," "dragonflies trapped"), which occasionally threatens to overcrowd the high-pressure beats. A minor capitalization slip ("Intangibly tangible") slightly mars the polish.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from significant simile churn ("like a prayer," "like moths," "like a throat," "like ink," "like chased brass," "like a door," "like embroidery"). This density of figurative language creates a predictable syntactic rhythm that dulls the imagery. The "surprised to be surprised" loop feels like a stylistic tic rather than a deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high and imagery like the "brined alphabet" is exceptional. The repetition of the phrase "sieved hush" feels slightly mechanical, but the rhythm and sentence variety generally support the story’s momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is evocative ("cold as gull bone"), but the mandatory repetition of full prompt phrases (e.g., "antique drawer pull" four times) creates a noticeable rhythmic drag and artifact effect. Information density is generally good, but the "furrowed hush" bookends feel slightly staged.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and strained metaphors ("wind buttered the water," "bruised... like a watermark," "gulls stitched errant commas"). The density of figurative language distracts from the action and obscures clarity in high-pressure beats, violating the rubric's economy standards.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished and rhythmic, with no technical artifacts. However, the high density of similes ("like stubborn constellations," "like a public hearing," "like smoke") occasionally crowds the prose, drawing attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and a high density of abstract metaphors ("constellations map my lungs," "grammar of wind," "kiss like comets") that clutter the narrative. This "purple" style obscures physical causality and reduces the emotional impact of the climax by favoring ornamentation over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generally strong, but marred by a clunky repetition artifact in the middle: "The saucer came from a dolls' tea set, and the dolls' tea set saucer crack veined it..." This syntax stutters noticeably. Metaphor density is high ("warning and a prayer arguing") but mostly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no scaffold. A few metaphors ("throat learning the first vowel," "reality yield like skin") border on mixed or overwrought, but the rhythmic control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density (e.g., "stitched silver commas," "velvet hem," "metallic sighs"), which clogs the pacing and draws attention to the author's hand. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, creating a "purple" texture that obscures the action. A stricter edit is needed to allow the strong imagery to breathe without the suffocating ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is overwritten, with a density of figurative language that impedes momentum (e.g., "keys clinked like cool birds," "metal stuttered," "hinges quivered with rumors" all in one paragraph). This saturation creates a haze where clarity suffers for the sake of poetic effect. The writing is polished but lacks the variation needed to let high-stakes moments breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    The imagery is dense and evocative ("thin as breath," "fragile logic"), but the sentence structure suffers from repetitive subject-opener patterns ("I am," "I place," "I hum," "I scoop"). While this cadence supports the ritualistic tone, the syntactic monotony drags on the narrative momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("conspiracy of paper," "ink drying on sky"). At times, the figurative density risks stalling momentum ("tin taste of beginnings"), but the line-level craft is rigorous and evocative, supporting the story’s mythic quality.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from extreme metaphor density ("music under a cough," "grammar in bruises"), which occasionally stalls momentum. While lyrically impressive, the relentless figurative language risks becoming opaque and distancing the reader from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from extreme metaphor density; nearly every noun is paired with a figurative modifier ("knot is a stanza," "bracket a breath," "shard a possible vowel"), which obscures the action. The physics break ("braid rebar") and the explicit labeling of symbols ("blooming resistance") trigger the overwriting and coherence penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from simile congestion ("like a sleeping centipede," "like a tin moon," "like a trapped lark") which slows momentum. A notable redundancy ("compasses in its bones... click like flickering compasses") creates a jarring echo that editing should have caught.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is dense and imaginative ("data arranges itself like petals"), but the repetition of prompt phrases ("empirically whimsical" x3, "luminous doubt" x3) feels like a checklist rather than organic weaving. These recurrent tags act as slight stumbling blocks in an otherwise polished flow.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is rhythmically sound but suffers from metaphor congestion; similes like "patience I carried like a watering can" feel clunky and imprecise for an expert narrator. The density of figurative language occasionally obscures physical action, trading clarity for poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between long, neutron-catalogue clauses and abrupt horticultural commands, echoing the slope/cliff tension. No scaffold or synonym loops; each line adds new information or sensorial tilt. Metaphors stay physically consistent—star decay ↔ orchid rot—no mixed vehicles. Minor over-adjectival moment (“faint bronze that refuses to be scrubbed”) is paid off by its later functional use as wind-map.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between valley-long exhales and crystalline fragments that mimic cooling cracks. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends the glass/heat lexicon. One mixed-metor risk—“clusters of blackened crates leaned like folded wings”—but image stays physically coherent. Information density high: one sentence often layers geography backstory and emotional temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned (frost = stave, heat = note) and never muddled. Opening line anchors voice and concept simultaneously. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“threaded,” “sealed,” “sang”) drive propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is organic; sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts tight. Figurative density is high but patterned—velvet, drawer, librarian—each re-cast to serve pressure, never purple. One scaffold loop: “chased stillness” appears twice in adjacent lines; minor −0.2. No metaphor muddle at closure; information density routinely doubles (e.g., “rings that learned the circular grammar of waves”).

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold, high multi-function density (“bell held flour chits, insulin vials, and once a ring a widow insisted could become rice”). Metaphors are coherent—bell as heart, as shore, as mouth—each re-inflection accruing rather than contradicting. Syntax breathes with beat-length: short bursts for night runs, lingering sentences for arbor stillness. Final line (“quiet amplified across the ridge like weather”) crystallizes the accruing hush without decorative excess. No artifact touches closure; read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence handles tool, breath, and metaphysics (“Through a length of clear tubing, my breath opens the aperture, then closes it like a tide”). No loops or scaffold; metaphor chain (lantern-bellows-tide-ocean) stays coherent. Minor near-repeat of “breathe” stem in final paragraph keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    High-density lines (“bronze body eaten by moss, the circle split and swallowed”) do triple work: image, stakes, time-eaten. Rhythm accelerates across “quaking reverie” paragraph, then exhales into single-clause final walk-out. One mixed metaphor—“ink dropped into water, black ripples across years”—slight blur, but resolved within accumulative lens. Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts all change knowledge or charge.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances mechanism or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and physically loyal: “arrow with strange fletching… quills stitched from carnival tickets” fuses tool to setting without metaphoric sprawl. Information density high: single sentence slips grandmother, drought causality, and piano tuning lore into vault origin. No scaffold sentences; even abstractions (“patience of losers”) are tethered to sensory referent “thumbs blistered.”

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences are dense but propulsive: “kelp brushed the ribs of ships and the orchard scaffolds, and their greens whispered tin” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph cuts cleanly—remove any and you lose knowledge of forge, father, or device. Metaphors stay coherent within underwater physics (bubbles like pale bells) and synesthetic logic. One mixed vehicle—“aurora…a trembling veil…tired curtain”—is allowed because it accumulates the same aurora across emotional phases. Register never drifts; even technical terms are filtered through POV need.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm modulates from long, breath-held sentences to staccato fragments that echo train announcements. Figurative density is high but patterned—each metaphor is refracted light, so coherence holds. No scaffold loops; every sentence either advances image or tightens choice. Peak beat “moonbeams clicked their tiny shutters” is crystalline, unobscured.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes with furnace cycle; sentence openings vary, paragraphs shorten as glass cools. Information density high—single sentence can layer tool, memory, and ethic: “I hold the cracked leather bookmark with my teeth as I work the marver.” One mixed-metor alert: “stubborn mirror” is briefly strained yet saved by immediate physical payoff (“reflects my face”). No loops or scaffold; even repetitions of “cue” are purposeful pattern. Read-aloud ear clean.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is oceanic: cadence swells and ebbs, sentence openings vary, no template churn. Figurative density is high but patterned—gold flakes, salt teeth, syrup hush—each reappears to reweight meaning, avoiding decorative overload. No mixed metaphors; physical logic holds. Minor scaffold: “the hush marbled...and settled without settling” verges on self-paraphrase but serves the accumulative design; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences multi-task: “I clear the frost frill from its bridge with a feathered brush from storage” delivers action, tool, sensory touch, and ritual weight in 19 words. No mixed metaphors; ice-as-sky, tone-as-drain are consistent liquid-reflective vehicles. High density achieved through participle clusters that remain sequential (“clearing...listening...cracked only when I forgot”). Zero loops, zero scaffold; even the repeated ‘loop’ is thematic piston, not filler.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    High figurative density risks purple drift but each vehicle advances mood or theme: rain-beads as connecting dots, lamp-halos as forgetting. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. Rhythm clusters in threes echo museum catalog order, pattern justified. Scaffold almost absent—one paraphrase loop (“after words become unnecessary” repeated) mildly dulls; otherwise propulsion clean. Final line cadence earns rest.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences deliver backstory, sensor-tech critique, and emotional stance (“marbles… rolled away when merchants standardized fate”). Metaphors stay coherent (twine, tinder, sap) and serve emotional temperature. No paraphrase loops; each marble/ribbon beat adds new angle or cost. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) acceptable as narrator mirrors audit lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary from fluid orchestral rolls to clipped turbine beats; no template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent—magnetic hush, angular river—anchored in physics of the scene. Only minor scaffold: “sideways” appears three times in 30 lines; still propels rather than loops.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences do double duty: “I tightened my bow, slid the program under my shirt to dry, and listened” = action, object handling, and emotional cache in one line. Figurative language is sparse and precise—light as “trembling score,” silence that “mirrors mine.” No loops or synonym churn; “water” is never repeated without new physical consequence.的节奏随压力加速，但从未牺牲清晰性。Closure line “she lives there” is monosyllabic, releasing breath after tension.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: each sentence layers meteorological, moral, and tactile data without scaffold. Figurative control sustains extended aurora/avalanche metaphors that never collide; vehicles stay physically coherent. Zero paraphrase loops, no register drift; technical jargon (outgassing clicks, glide plane, desiccant scale) is accurate and POV-appropriate. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif, meeting the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: single sentences fuse action, image, abstraction (“confession…warm weight like another hand”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Figurative language disciplined—metaphors stay industrial (prayer gulped at daylight). One mixed image only: “machine that never stops” as both literal conveyor and metaphysical appetite, but justified by radio-call source. Final line cadence mirrors heartbeat; no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose attains poetic density yet avoids purple overload; clauses are deliberate, no scaffold or synonym loops, strong information density. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “regenerative silence”) is justified by keeper’s erudite lens. Final third keeps clarity and propulsion, satisfying high-band line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: single sentences perform setting, metaphor, and emotional cue—“the ridge smelled of crushed sage and dust, and the town was waiting for the coming solar eclipse like a long, held note.” No paraphrase loops; each repetition (bowl sings / tap answers) accrues new consequence. Metaphors stay coherent—lacework shadows, shawl of darkness—without mixed vehicle crash. Rhythm breathes with eclipse tempo: longer sentences pre-totality, fragment post-release. Minor filter verbs crop up (“I felt”) but always paired with embodied sensation, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level propulsion is high: information arrives as sensory deed (“carbon dust marking his fingertips like new fingerprints”) without scaffold. Figurative density risks purple only once—“broken freight syllables”—but the pattern is taught early and reused self-consistently. No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends the acoustic anatomy (ribs, bell, socket). Opening and final lines anchor voice and re-charge motif, satisfying read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and syntactic shape, propelling the accumulative design; figurative language is selective, never dense enough to stall momentum. Occasional poetic compression (“steam rose like staff lines”) is earned by the musical motif and lands cleanly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers stakes or atmosphere. Figurative control is tight: “braided like river grip around a stone” fuses touch and motion. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Minor elevation in diction is priest-appropriate; clarity never buckles.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythmic control is virtuosic: sentence length modulates like measures, crescendoing then resting into white space. Figurative density is high but patterned—each metaphor is a musical instruction (“mirrored horizon becomes a staff”)—never violating physical logic. No synonym loops; information is double-loaded (“hairline cracks, shy and precise”). Minor scaffold: repeated “I climb again” could be trimmed, but momentum is unbroken and closure image remains crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo—short percussive bursts during float, expansive cadence after the fall. Metaphors are internally coherent: “lamp buzzed through my skull like a gnat” sustains insect-light imagery. No synonym loops; each recurrence (“arches multiplied inside the arch”) adds compression, not filler. Information density high—one sentence often layers setting, emotion, and rule exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud ear is strong: sentence lengths wax and wane like breath. Information density high—one sentence often carries image + emotion + world rule. Figurative language is patterned and paid off: moth-silk filament returns to kiss the rim. Minor template cadence in ‘she imagined… she imagined’ but it serves accumulative design. No mixed metaphors; physical logic held. One paraphrase loop: ‘audibly muted’ appears four times—intentional motif yet slightly over-repeated. No artifacts in closure beat; final line is clean, crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    Metaphors are sparse, precise, and mutually reinforcing: folded paper boats / folded map / folded hair form a lattice that never contradicts physical logic. Rhythm modulates with pressure—contemplative iambs accelerate into spondaic injunction “bring rain truth.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances either stakes or texture. Copy-clean: no tense drift, no pronoun ambiguity, no mixed vehicles; “quiet signature” remains metaphorical yet physically tied to fence wire.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lines are dense, propulsive, and loop-free; figurative language is selective (“the sea rehearsing its sleep”); no mixed metaphors; sentence cadence modulates with scene breath, and high information ratio advances image or choice with every clause; minor hairline repetition of “breathe/breathing” does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is oceanic—varied sentence openings, no template cadence. Information density is high: one sentence often layers acoustic, emotional, and ecological data. Figurative control precise: “ribs of ships encircle like elders” marries anatomy, ancestry, and acoustics without mixed metaphor. Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; no artifacts in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: single sentences deliver scent chemistry, emotional calculus, and tactile spark. No mixed metaphors; “static netting us like spidersilk” extends prior electrical conceit. Rhythm modulates—long susurrus clauses for grotto hum, staccato for electrode clicks. Only a faint template cadence in “professionally thorough” refrain stops this at 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    High density: "gulls edit the sky with quiet glides" does three jobs. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary openings. One mixed metaphor—"lighthouse" on ledger page—minor, doesn't obscure closure. Lemon-salt, cocoa steam, velvet pouch: concrete nouns over modifiers. Read-aloud rhythm supports cautious exuberance without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is almost surgical: “drops hang bright as beads” packs sight, viscosity, and held breath into five words. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks; each sentence advances either canal physics or moral ledger. Occasional poetic compression (“continental twitch”) risks momentary abstraction but is paid off by immediate physical consequence (puddles tilt, chains jangle). Closure image—“it skitters along the channels”—is clean, active, and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often twins sensory data with abstract math (“joy equals expansion”). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates at the slowing drip—an intentional inversion. Closure beat is crystalline: “silence opens like a gate” without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences (crawl) and clipped fragments (motor complains). Metaphors stay physically coherent: tape “rigid as a leaf” foreshadows leaf-like hair trigger. Zero paraphrase loops; every line adds new texture or propulsion. Only hairline slip: “apologize for spying” line edges toward meta, but compression keeps momentum intact and it falls outside closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Figurative language is patterned and paid off: tide-as-lung returns in “tired lung” of desal hall, rain “crept” like the painter himself. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay hydraulic. Information density high—“amber holds sunlight like a breath” does twin duty of object and theme. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Clean grammar, pronouns unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: each figurative reach is anchored to sensory payoff—“kitchen noises and lullabies” keeps the metaphor tethered to audible fact. No loops or scaffold; information density is high (one sentence often layers acoustic, emotional, and mythic registers). Rhythm accelerates into the list of ordinary words, then lands on the single tactile image of the warmed pearl—cadence mirrors arc. One mixed metaphor (“eclipse leans closer, curious as a moth”) is hairline but does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences layer sensory, historical, and emotional data—“valve smells of metal, kelp, and time.” One mixed metaphor—“echoes answer in ten thousand knuckles”—is fleeting and functional, not muddled. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; scaffolding is minimal. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    Almost every sentence carries dual duty: “cracks in pavement forming arrows” maps terrain and psyche in one breath. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Metaphors stay internally coherent—ticket punch as tiny thunder—without crowding peak beats. Minor late elevation (“listening fires”) barely grazes closure; clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; propulsive syntax carries high information density—one sentence often paints setting, advances ritual, and nails emotion. Metaphors stay coherent: winter-ice glaze parallels memory fragility, no vehicle clashes. One minor scaffold spotted (“I told him we were building a room…” repeats prior idea), but momentum unbroken. No artifact near closure; final lines crystallize without obscuring causality. Overall, ear is clean, rhythm serves pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences layer image and causality. Occasional metaphor stacks (“tooth in dream,” “cliff spoken aloud”) risk purple but stay legible. Minor scaffold: “hush carried thunder” echoed thrice; filter verbs light. No clarity break at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: information-dense lines (“I would not outrun them, but I could outlast their attention if I cut grief into rehearsed gestures that bored them”) do triple duty—character, tactic, theme. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (“skin to arithmetic” fits the ledger motif). Minor register lift in “discipline of an equation solved to the last digit” is earned by prior math-teacher setup. Closure beat clean, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences layer task, sensory data, and metaphor (“blossoms refract the first light into soft confetti”). Mixed-metaphor risk is flirted but controlled—lamps remember, bonsai exhale, silence names colors—vehicles stay within light/breath family. Only one paraphrase loop detected (“quiet instruments… silence has not learned to refuse”) but it serves cadence, not padding. Closure beat is crystal, no artifact touches it.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    High figurative density is patterned early—diesel sheen, crab hieroglyphs—and paid off in final tide metaphor; no mixed vehicles. Sentence rhythm accelerates with ship-horn fragments, then exhales into long final clause. No loops or synonym churn; each image adds new sensory layer. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is narrator’s self-invented bureaucratese, justified.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “Its spiral lip caught my breath and returned it with a ghost of tide” advances object, body, and metaphor. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective, never stacked in high-pressure beats. Concrete nouns and strong verbs dominate; passive voice appears only for tonal effect (“was returned”). Final line lands with varied cadence and image clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every line advances route, cash, or soul. Metaphors are coherent—confetti routes, shrimp-mouth socket—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates from fireworks-folded-into-cinders compression to low-hum diesel-jasmine cadence. Only micro-loop: “rerouted the main glitter current around Old Clinic Row” repeats “route” notion already implicit; single −0.1, still 8.9.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong information density: one sentence often toggles between sensory ground, emotional stake, and procedural detail—“camera ticks with the last seconds of a long exposure, swallowing the Milky Way like bread.” Metaphors are spare and consistent; no mixed vehicle violations. One light scaffold: “the world has changed, but the stone remembers” is thematic summary, yet it is the only such line and serves as hinge into closure, so penalty is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Density is high yet breathable: “She touched the drone’s thorax and felt the faint chatter of damaged harmonics” does characterization, plot, and metaphor in one stroke. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is limited to two per beat and always sonic or tactile. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line releases a conceptual snap that re-casts every prior sound. Proofing clean, pronoun chains unambiguous, spatial tracking flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Every sentence does two jobs: “The ice receives us without cracking, which is its own kind of threat” advances both atmosphere and stake. No paraphrase loops or metaphor muddle; vehicles stay coherent (condensation = isobaric prayer = dendrites = antlers). Varied sentence length creates natural inhale/exhale rhythm. Only hairline slip: “long syntax” is borderline abstract, but immediate granite/fern smell grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence variety and information density are high; most lines fuse sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Occasional metaphor stacks (“choir guarding a candle”) flirt with overwriting but pattern holds and serves cadence. No loops or scaffolding; pronouns and props track cleanly. A single mixed image—“hawk tightening claws on its own legs”—momentarily violates underwater physics, but the intent is self-harm analogy, not literal fauna. Ear-test reads aloud with propulsive musicality.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rich figurative density occasionally stacks in adjacent sentences (“tide negotiated parole,” “copper plate pressing…”) but pattern is taught early and does not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops; spatial choreography is clear. One mixed metaphor ribs/skin overlap mildly jars, and filter-verb stack (“I began to hover in earnest”) is present but momentary; closure image remains pristine, so high-band viable with minor deduction.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    High-density metaphor is balanced—no mixed metaphors in peak beat, syntax varies from long breath to fragment, and sentence openings avoid drumbeat; “orchid solace” risks purple but is ear-tested by the fevered lyric context, and momentum is untouched at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “the faint perfume of gum arabic” does triple sense/occupation/texture duty. One mixed metaphor (“mouth full of coins” beside “brass teeth”) is hairline but doesn’t cloud causality. No loops or scaffold; paragraphs are lean, each advances stance or setting. Closural promise line is lucid, rhythmic, unadorned.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long accumulative clauses to short hinge-commands that mimic gear ticks. Information density high; each metaphor carries double duty (wax = seal & clue). One mixed-metaphor risk—“murmuring flock” applied to map flicker—barely coherent but occurs mid-scene, not at closure, so minor chip.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm ebbs and surges like tide—“I do not smoke; I stay” snap-paddle after long flowing clauses; no template cadence. Metaphors stay physically coherent—broken rainspout shard slick “with old storms” links to condensation messages without mixed logic. High information density: one line often does two jobs (“the paper relieved of work it was not born to do” both releases letter and implies grief’s futility). Only hairline slip: “fierce tenderness I barely deserve” flirts with diagnostic self-assessment but is immediately grounded by shard-in-hand pain.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric density is high but patterned—metaphors return as tools (coral = map = seal) so figurative layering earns its place. No mixed metaphors; fog stitching to palms to metronomes stays within atmospheric register. Scaffolding nearly absent; only one paraphrase loop (“shared anxieties” echoed) but it accrues thematic weight. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested, propulsive. Register never drifts above POV’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.1)
    Near-zero scaffold; each sentence at least dual-purpose. Metaphors are kept physically loyal—fog as emulsion, roots as antennae—no mixed-vehicle crashes. Information density is surgical: "weighed cables with stones" implies weather worry, manual skill, and precarious tech in five words. Minor loop risk in repeated "laugh/light" chiming, but it pattern-teaches the contagion motif and pays off in final bulbs-chime. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density; most sentences do two jobs (e.g., “I clap, soft, and guide the echo with the nickel held like a tiny shield, bending it through reflected sound toward the flaking blues”). Occasional metaphor pile-ups in calmer moments (“time flowers outward, each petal another room”) flirt with overwriting but are pattern-taught and paid off. Zero paraphrase loops, clean grammar, no filter-verb stacks. Final third stays sharp, allowing high-band consideration.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops, near-zero filter verbs; information density sky-high—one sentence often does three jobs (“We drafted the answer in soil…like a moving reply”). Metaphors stay physically coherent: ledger-ink literally blurred by ants, shadow-clock legible only with breath. Register never drifts into academic; diction stays inside collective vernacular. Final pollen-payment line is crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    High figurative density but vehicles remain coherent within organic/floral logic; no mixed-metaphor collisions. Information-dense lines (“Sleep avoids me…I say, but peace has been avoiding us longer”) advance status and theme simultaneously. Minor loop: “shyly unstoppable” appears three times—accept as motif; does not stall. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Almost every sentence layers two jobs (image + motion: “she wound the cracked chime once more, ready to collect what the world had lost”), with only one paraphrase loop (“names… not letters… but the breath behind them”) slightly dulling the blade.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong rhythmic variety, sentences breathe from long image-chains to short declaratives at hinge moments (“The door gave a small click”). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the musical conceit without contradiction. One mixed metaphor—“drop of intent”—is minor. Information density is high: one sentence often carries setting, emotion, and backstory (“It had belonged to my grandmother…”). Filter verbs are minimal; perception stays embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud ear is musical; sentence lengths crest and breathe like the amphitheater itself. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent—“stone lung,” “fossilized waves”—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence can orient, characterize, and foreshadow (“dappled resolve” links tone to later bat-light schedule).

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythmic control is acute: paragraph lengths visually mimic wingbeats—short for launch, long for vigil, short for landing. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Figurative density spikes only at the climactic release and is paid off by the return scuff. Minor register lift in “arithmetic of maps” fits the POV’s bookish lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative language is selective, never clogs high-pressure beats. Information density high: “light passes through the margin holes and lands on the wood grain, aligning winds to rings” does triple duty. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor filter verbs (“I begin analyzing”) do not dull immediacy. Closure image remains crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyric density is high yet purposeful; only one paraphrase loop (“luminous respite” repeated in adjacent sentences). Metaphors stay coherent (plankton as held hand, vents schooling us). Final line cadence mirrors sunrise blade—crisp exit. Occasional elevated diction (“shadowseam wonder,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly overleaps POV lexicon but reads as ritualized voice, not register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences handle atmosphere, tool action, and emotional transliteration. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (foam/tide/glass). One minor scaffold: “the cave listened…sighed like a bell after rain” followed immediately by “cheerful gloom, it said without a mouth” — slight echo but cadence justifies the bell/mouth pairing. Closure image crystal-clear.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm is oceanic: paragraph lengths swell and ebb; sentence openings vary from participial breezes to subject-verb punches. Mixed metaphors are deliberate and coherent—“salt and wind measuring each beat as if the sea had a metronome” keeps physical logic. No loops or synonym churn; information density is high (one sentence often sets scene, reveals motive, cues sound). Only micro-slip: “between acts” is repeated twice in close proximity, a hairline scaffold that keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “glass dust still glittering in the seams of my cuffs” does triple duty (occupation, texture, time of day). Occasional elevated diction (“noctilucent reckonings,” “conceptual repricing”) momentarily lifts above workman lexicon but reads as conscious mystic register rather than thesaurus drift. No mixed metaphors, loops, or scaffold beats. Final line cadence mirrors opening hush, closing the circle cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “pulled that ribbon from a porch rail before flame lifted the roof like a closing fist” does world, object, and metaphor in one stroke. Rhythm breathes with ascent/descent. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Line-level artifacts never touch closure. Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    Syntactic variety is virtuosic without showiness: “I released trial balloons, little lanterned globes that drifted…” packs appositive, metaphor, and motion in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new pressure or texture. Metaphors stay physically coherent—tide, lift, salt—never mixing vehicles. A single template cadence sneaks in three “When…” openings in mid-page beats, but the pattern is taught early and serves as incantation, forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid templates. Figurative language is dense but patterned (echo as cinema, walls as skin) and never muddles causality. No loops or synonym churn. Final beat—“began the day by learning where mercy echoes best”—carries propulsive closure. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) fits narrator’s scholarly tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. High information density: single line often layers ritual act, sensory detail, and internal calculation. Metaphors stay coherent (“the seam will close like a wound” fits wound/trauma frame). Minor scaffold: two adjacent sentences start with “I take/ask” but pattern taught early and reprised at closure, so forgiven. Final image line is crisp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: every metaphor carries physical consequence—moonwater bowl holds literal frost-melt that will soak her soles. No mixed vehicles; prism logic stays optical, never becomes random crystal-spray. Varied sentence length mirrors pulse thinning: short clauses at threshold, expansive release after door opens. No loops or scaffold; each line either advances image or tightens breath-clock. Opening and closing lines act as dovetail joints, re-using “between sigh and smile” to reweight meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—“the stick felt heavier than wood” = tactile, metaphorical, moral weight. Figurative language is selective, never stacked in high-pressure beats. Minor scaffold: “the dome curved overhead like a skullcap” is the single overt simile and it earns its place. Cadence modulates from languid to staccato as the bar scene accelerates, propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Figurative language is dense yet patterned early (“clouds moved like sleeping herds”) so the payoff at the monarch’s flame-like departure feels earned. One scaffold echo: “blushing stillness” repeats without new charge, a hairline slip. Otherwise high density, no mixed metaphors, strong clause variety.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density—each sentence layers sensory, technical, and emotional data; figurative language is disciplined, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated latinate diction (“transcribed memory,” “harmonics”) momentarily lifts above colloquial register but reads as caster’s precision; minor scaffold in “I whispered thanks to the things that remember.” Final third remains clear, no artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but purposeful; mixed-metaphor risk is high yet vehicles stay coherent (“storm applauded with rain,” “vines reknit their modesty”). One minor loop: “brittle” used twice within four lines (seal + vows). Otherwise each sentence layers image, sense, or action; no filler. Read-aloud rhythm rises and falls like weather; paragraph cuts are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety and information density are high; each line does double duty—e.g., “ceiling mapped with chipped lapis, animals, and a river of ash where constellations once glowed” seeds later arrow formation. No loops or scaffold; near-duplicates excised. One mixed metaphor risk—“bronze warmed like a cheek” beside “dark as a well”—but the tactile shift serves the faith-as-intimacy beat and does not obscure closure. Register stays within scholar’s diction; no thesaurus-itis.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between staccato tactical beats and elongating lyric lifts, mirroring the shift from war pulse to silence. Information density high: single sentences hinge grief to siege geography. No mixed metaphors; every vehicle (thorn, blade, dust river) stays within the military-love lexicon. Only minor paraphrase loop (“silent sanctuary… silence was its true melody”) costs the final 0.5 toward 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (action, atmosphere, metaphor). Figurative language is selective—no stacked metaphors in peak beats. Occasional syntactic parallelism (“each inhale… each exhale”) is purposeful, taught by second paragraph. Minor filter verb (“felt”) in final third but does not dull closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances image or tactic. Density is extreme—“citrus humming with bees” packs sight, sound, and imminent fall in five words. Metaphors stay physically loyal (tape is “brittle,” joint “weeps”). Only one near-repeat of “committee” is allowed because it is self-consciously reframed. The final line “they called it a seasonal handshake” is a perfect rhythmic snap that re-opens rather than closes, earning its ellipsis.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lyric density is high yet every figurative layer *does work*: “petals edited the air” erases and re-inscribes meteor dust—mirrors the curator’s task. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Rhythm modulates from long breathless accumulations to the staccato *“Ask.”* Opening and closing lines bookend with sonic echo (“brightened disquiet” / “when the pumps begin”). Zero artifacts in final third; clarity never blurs.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose density is high: single sentences often scent, map, and emotionalize simultaneously (“air cools past Atlases of Abandoned Journeys”). Figurative layering is relentless yet coherent—no mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Occasional elevated diction (“calix for caveats”) is justified by the arcane-linguist POV. One minor scaffold: “I expect to renegotiate” could be compressed, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    Density is high: one sentence often layers metaphor, sensory data, and causal nudge—“We walked together, two freedoms tied, a trapped freedom that moved because we leaned.” No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors stay coherent within maritime-carnival logic. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9-band proximity; earlier “unkindled solace” is the single abstract hiccup.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract under gear-touch tension, then elongate during rope-work. Information density high—one sentence often does three jobs (“Its fibers remembered many hands…”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. A single overripe adjective pair (“slow intention”) is all that keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pressure—clause lengths compress during drum-strike, expand during hush-bloom. Metaphors are coherent within geologic/sonic domain; no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory data, emotional tilt, and world rule. Zero loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge, choice, or atmospheric charge.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances light, sound, or motive. High density: “nested the broken crystal prism in the cradle, its stump turned toward the gap that ached like a mouth” does three jobs in 21 words. Figurative language balanced—no purple drift; metaphors obey physical logic (light as river, thistle as rope). Final line cadence echoes opening wind-glass music, closing sonic circle. Minor scaffold: one “then” opener in final third, but clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences open with changing parts of speech. Occasional stacked metaphor (“reefed air remembers”) risks density but stays pattern-taught. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Final image crystallizes without over-writing. Minor filter verbs (“I feel the hush gather”) are voice-motivated and tolerated.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    High figurative density is patterned early (“petals seemed cautious”) and earned by closure; no mixed metaphors. Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath-sentence launches, then fragment-“hush symbol.” Minor template echo—“he chants while walking” repeated thrice—dulls immediacy slightly but never in peak closure beat. Information multiplexes: mortar placement, wind correction, emotional register in single lines.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rich but disciplined: most sentences advance image or emotional charge. A few metaphor clusters risk overwriting—“sentences of foam,” “grammar of night”—yet pattern is taught early and serves texture. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Minor register spikes (“conceptual repricing”-like diction) appear in abstract nounings but do not touch closure. Rhythm breathes with tide; final line is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid templates. Metaphors are coherent within physics of inversion and silence-as-substance, no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and world data (“It smells of rope and patience; it is a path cleared, not yet walked”). Minor filter-verb clustering in two lines (“I feel the weight lift…”) but immediacy returns instantly. No loops, paraphrase, or scaffold; closing line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    High-density lines: “storm glass vial knit spiky snow” does triple sensory-metaphorical duty. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances hush-texture or character choice. Rhythm modulates from long terrace glide to staccato bell-count. Figurative language is patterned and paid off: crystal softness mirrors mother’s exhale; harbor metaphor answers earlier “vaulting hush.”

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or causality. Mixed-metaphor guard passed: waterfall→windows→color-taste maintains internal logic. Rhythm accelerates through enjambed clauses toward the aperture breach, then relaxes into the rain sentence—cadence mirrors ascent. Opening and closing lines are crystalline anchors that recharge one another via the radio/throne transmutation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric density is high yet every sentence advances aura or stakes; no scaffolding or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent—ash/blackboard, ring/ladle-well—and stay within physical logic. Read-aloud rhythm varies: long tide-sentences collapse into staccato breath counts. Only hairline slip: “loaded emptiness” edges toward oxymoron cliché, but is saved by later pulse qualification.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between oceanic roll and torque of bolt-turning, mirroring pressure waves. Sentences perform double duty: “Pressure rose like a patient tide, and the mushrooms brightened, and the chamber sang…” advances plot, atmosphere, and metaphor in one breath. Occasional stacked modifiers (“constellations of interference”) flirt with purple but payoff in closure image. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase; first/last line symmetry (“fasten circles… gentle hard things”) is purposeful callback, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Information density high—one sentence often does three jobs (e.g., “cold as a question and shaped with deliberate stubborn grace” = tactile detail, character judgment, foreshadowing key). Rhythm breathes with scene beats; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Only one mixed metaphor (“candle smoke returning to wax”) is minor hairline slip that does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Metaphor density is high but patterned—every vehicle is vegetal, astral, or metallurgical—so the risk of purple overload is mostly averted. One coherence slip: “the chill was not coldness, but a shivering bliss” edges toward self-contradiction, yet the paradox is intentional. Information density is excellent; no scaffold, no paraphrase loops. A single template cadence (“He…then he…”) appears but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and information—“brass face scarred, shank bent, rim greened by sweat” does triple work. Metaphors stay coherent: button as “small stubborn star” fits infantryman/cosmos motif. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“origami doubt”) reads intentional for archivist’s lyric bent. Peak beat—unfurling knot—remains lucid and tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences do triple duty (“She fitted the phone booth key, felt the tumblers complain, and listened as the hatch sighed open like a confession”). No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Mixed-metaphor risk managed—vehicles stay physical (keys, moths, cattails). One tiny scaffold: “documenting each contact in a pocket notebook stitched from ration forms” could trim to “in a ration-paper notebook,” but artifact does not touch closure. Ear-rhythm varied; paragraph cuts purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences perform double labor—description plus tactic: “the code licks my ears like a patient tide” advances both ambience and menace. Rhythm modulates from languid pre-dawn to clipped final buckle. One paraphrase loop (“promise held shut…melt its teeth”) is minor. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors cohere within sonic/aquatic field. Closure image is clean, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses from whale-sentence to fragment (“release, not store; scatter, not save”) without algorithmic pattern. Metaphors are arboreal-consistent (whale, bark, resin) and never mixed. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds leaf, bone, or gust detail. Opening and closing lines bookend with lift/landing motion, securing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence variety good; information density high—“numbers I could not read warmed the walls” does three jobs. No mixed metaphors; “water teeth engaged the wheel with patient bite” extends machine ontology cleanly. Minor paraphrase loop in “uncertainly certain” refrain (−0.2). Final line ear-test strong. Artifacts do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “I temper iron blooms into petaled discs, arranging them around the coin like questions around a heart.” No loops, no scaffold; figurative language is sparse, deliberate, and paid off. Metaphors stay metallurgically coherent; mixed-vehicle risk is deftly sidestepped. Opening and closing lines frame voice/stakes and re-weight motif respectively—tight ear for cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned—misaligned music as portal—taught early and paid off, so no overwrite penalty. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances stakes or atmosphere. Strong verbs (“plucked,” “bit,” “limped”) replace modifiers. Closure line is crisp, recharging the river image.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density: single sentences weld metal memory, corridor math, and bodily spasm. Metaphors never mixed; “bruised humming” stays acoustic-physical. One scaffold trace: “I count backward” echoed twice in 30 words (−0.2); otherwise zero loops. Final line cadence drops into survivable cadence, no artifact near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Metaphor density is high but purposeful—each image extends the nautical-light motif; no mixed vehicles. Occasional scaffold ("elusively tangible" repeated thrice) drags without new inflection; likewise "between childhood and now" becomes a chorus. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively, but the closing "tide within a tide" line is the first moment where cadence truly crystallizes the emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density—almost every sentence layers image + motion + subtext. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with discovery beats; paragraph cuts are clean. Minor over-packaging in opening two sentences keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or paraphrase; each sentence layers new image or causality. Metaphors stay coherent (glass fruit, frost type, bottled breath) and do not collide. High density: “the page opened the orchard” compresses spatial and conceptual reversal in five words. Register remains within POV’s plausible lexicon of printmaker and archivist.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    High figurative density risks overwrite; several adjacent sentences launch metaphor vehicles that nudge toward purple. Rhythm remains varied and read-aloud strong; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One paraphrase loop: “burnished sorrow” repeated with small variation—intentional motif but still loops. No grammar or prop contradictions; clarity preserved, but slight compression would sharpen already-good lines.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new acoustic or tactile data. Figurative language is patterned and paid off—light as migrant rumor, hinge that “forgot how to betray”—so density feels necessary, not purple. No mixed metaphors; physical logic (violin hair tension, chip warming) stays coherent. Read-aloud ear reveals variable cadence that mirrors winding/unwinding motion, propelling rather than ornamenting.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    High figurative density but each metaphor is anchored to geology or weather—no purple drift. One scaffold spot: “resonant hush” is repeated four times; the cadence becomes template-like, dulling the final instance. Otherwise information-dense: one sentence often does three jobs (anchor, sensory hit, foreshadow). No simultaneity errors; opening line anchors voice and stakes immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud cadence varies—long breath-sentence follows staccato fragments. High density: one sentence often paints weather + memory + tool. Occasional stacked metaphors (“turbines a drowned organ”) flirt with overwriting but stay legible. No loops or filter-verb stacks; closure line cleanly propels. Minor scaffold: “perpetually learning” repeated without fresh angle late in text.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud ear is musical without algorithmic repetition; sentence openings vary from participial to noun-phrase to clause. Information density high: one line can layer time, pigment, and moral stance. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. The only figurative strain—“snow leaked away like milk from a bowl”—is brief and image-consistent. Closure image (“first stars touched the water”) is crystal-clear and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences do triple duty (“diary folded open like a throat” = object, agency, metaphor). No synonym churn or template cadence; openings vary. One mixed vehicle: “patient memory” mooring a zeppelin is briefly strained but context justifies. Minor scaffold: “both smelling of unfinished sentences” could trim, yet it advances relationship texture. Closure image is unblurred, propelling the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is almost loop-free; only minor echo (“lantern strings…loops in his head”) but pattern serves memory motif so forgiven. High density: one sentence often welds image + method + cost (“amber lens arranges lantern gleam into neighborhoods…marks them with cairns”). Metaphors stay coherent (light as street-planner). No artifact touches closure. A single paraphrase tic keeps it from 9.0 flat.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between long breathy accumulations and clipped ritual beats; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layer is dense yet coherent—sound has a rind, air wears mourning gloves—each image pays off in the final inscription. Zero scaffolding; every sentence advances atmosphere, tool-use, or internal stakes. opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is patterned—spirals, frost, breath—never muddled. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “turning the wind.” High density: “kernels shine like coins” does world, character, and theme work in five words.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent—“river that says, hush”—and do not collide. Information density is high: one sentence often does two jobs (advance + atmosphere). Minor scaffold: “I mop the night” repeats at open and close, but the reprise is intentional and paid off. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    High figurative density risks purple overload (“mute eloquence of labor ended yet still resonant”), yet rhythm breathes in tandem with escalating hush. No loops, clear propulsion, clauses carry double duty; metaphors stay internally consistent (glass/pollen/veil).

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density with metaphorical coherence sustained; occasional lyrical stacking (“glass panes strained around us, giving the room a watery heartbeat”) borders on overwriting but remains pattern-consistent and never obscures causality at closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; final ribbon image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    High figurative density is justified: pattern of textile/music/water imagery is taught early and pays off in final weave. No mixed metaphors; each vehicle (loom, shuttle, violin) stays coherent within its domain. Minor scaffold: “the reeds answer, and the puddles give back little circles of agreement” could lose one clause, but cadence serves child’s wonder. Closure image untouched by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates long lung-image sentences with clipped tool beats; figurative density peaks only at sanctioned lyric heights (“granite whales”). Information dual-loads: wire=conductor+stitch. Minor loop risk in “remodel” repetition is offset by verb shift (“I remodel” vs “we would remodel”) showing scale leap; no artifact obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is dense yet propulsive; most sentences carry double duty (image + action). Occasional metaphor stack in bloom passages (“wheels sainted with pollen,” “scent walks”) risks purple, but pattern is taught and serves accrual. Zero paraphrase loops, zero template cadence. Opening and closing lines act as hinge and lock, recharging “narrow vastness” from first to last breath.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: “nights fell in a wild hush that could make a welding torch sound shy” does triple sensory work. Rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences and clipped commands (“I copied… I pressed…”). No scaffold loops; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Figurative logic stays coherent—amber light as diary lens—without metaphor pile-up in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences do triple duty: “ink bled slowly, like it had to fight the same drag that tugged at our clocks” advances image, stakes, and theme simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; figurative logic stays physically coherent. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “song” and “warmth.” High density with natural rhythm; closure beat untouched by any artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm, propelling ascent then descent; metaphors stay coherent (time as river, stars as kelp) and never clog high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Information density is high—each clause adds image or stakes—yet clarity remains intact. Final line earns its resonance without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence music is deliberate yet natural; paragraph breaks sync with breath. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “absence could phosphoresce,” “nomadic penumbra.” No synonym loops; each noun is specific—“veined marble,” “sleeping vein.” Register stays within narrator’s lexicon. Minor scaffold risk in repeated “benevolently ruthless” but functions as refrain, not loop. Closure line is clean, rhythmic, unadorned.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm varies from long breathless coils to clipped imperatives (“I ask,” “He says”) that mimic ascending steps. Metaphors are sustained, not stacked—no mixed vehicles, no filter-verb clutter. Minor scaffold: “every step writes a question” / “my feet cannot read” is a paraphrase loop; does not touch closure, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    High-density lines perform multiple jobs—image, motion, metaphor—without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned and paid off (“snow hung midair like a held breath” → “snow finally fell as snow”). One mixed metaphor (“shreds of sky”) is minor, does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density achieved: one sentence often layers paint, confession, and civic threat. No paraphrase loops; each echo returns re-weighted. Metaphors (forge, prism, blade) interlock rather than clash. Occasional elevated register (“accounting of grief”) is earned by ritual frame, not register drift. Closure line is crisp, no artifact touch.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: underwater clauses lengthen, surface sentences shorten. Figurative density is high but patterned (gears, stars, scars) and pays off in final alloy vein—no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or ratio. Occasional elevated diction (“kintsugi intentions,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by alchemist’s vocation. Clean copy; no typos or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is high-density without purple: sentences carry image, emotion, and causal push in one stroke (“I rinsed the seashell, painted surface catching green light like fishscale”). Metaphors stay coherent under cave physics (mirror-crack, olive light, tide breath). Minor scaffold: “I painted… I painted…” repetition in one beat, but pattern teaches obsessiveness and pays off when he stops. No loops or register drift; every clause advances.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or synonym churn; “salt,” “cobalt,” “garden” recur with shifting charge. Metaphors stay coherent—lighthouse as lung, beam as bone—without purple overload. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” phrase is voice-justified by keeper’s reflective bent.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from long breath units to staccato bursts mimicking signal code. Figurative density is high but purposeful: “metal throat that swallowed its own echo” teaches the dish-as-body motif that recurs. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing”, “accumulative/textural”—is evaluator language, not story flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies from clipped logbook entries to longer, tide-like rolls; figurative language is selective—no purple storms. One scaffold loop (“because I am rational…”) and one near-mixed metaphor (“cables after weather” reads slightly off for human grace) but neither obscures causality or dulls the final image. Information density high: one sentence often performs scene, metaphor, and emotional shift. Proofing clean.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Metaphors are disciplined: “lighthouse breathe its tired white lung” is fresh yet physically exact. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence layers job—image, motion, interior. Rhythm modulates: fog-thick paragraphs yield to single-sentence strobe of the signal code. One minor scaffold: “the harbor learns the living by the gestures they do not finish” is abstract summary amid otherwise concrete chain, but it is brief and thematically pivotal, not obscuring.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often sets scene, advances plot, and delivers imagistic pay-off (“Light slain by the cliff gathered in the drops…”). No synonym loops or template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent—ants as ink, creek as torn silk. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “he”-fronted sentences in exit beat, not touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: every sentence advances image, pressure, or mythic logic. No synonym loops or template cadence; figurative language is patterned early and paid off (“lacy menace” echoed in lace-throat dream). Clause variation and paragraph-cut test passed—removing any paragraph would break the ritual sequence. Micro-slip: “bleeding starlight” repeated four times; slight rhythmic redundancy keeps this from 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythms breathe with reactor pulses: longer clauses heat up, fragments cool. Metaphors are coherent—soup agreeing, grain poured—no mixed vehicles. Zero filter-verb stacks or template cadences. One paraphrase loop (“revalue again tomorrow”) is permitted as mantra, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence-level propulsion is relentless: each line either advances image, choice, or atmosphere without scaffold. Figurative layering is dense yet precise—wind “fretted,” stove “ticked like an old heart,” jealousy “a magnet for loose iron”—all paid off in closure image. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif with exactitude.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tension; sentence length varies from short percussive fragments (“They speak in minutes”) to longer flowing images. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors; “water learning to speak” stays coherent within story logic. High information density: one sentence often shows tool, emotion, and symbolic overlay. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; “time drips” reprises purposely at closure. Copy-clean, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: each sentence layers action, image, and stakes without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—tea as cliff-hearer, lattice as frost stress—and stay within physical logic. Rhythm varies: fragments under breath-hold, longer release at thunder. Minor loop “held breath / breath” repeated but does not touch closure; otherwise zero paraphrase churn.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (scent + memory + social cost). Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Register stays within narrator’s lexicon; “Leyden jar” is earned. Rhythm accelerates with current surge, then breathes at final handshake—line craft serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, motion, or concept. Metaphors are internally coherent (dust → constellations → lens) and never mixed. Syntax varies from hieratic cadence to whispered brevity, matching the resounding hush. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve with imagistic precision, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, pressure, metaphor—without scaffold: “water climbed and fell through chambers, the station heart.” Figurative density peaks at closure yet maintains clarity. Zero loops, zero mixed metaphors; only one register twitch—“conceptual repricing” isn’t in narrator’s lexicon but appears in meta-reading, not text. Otherwise propulsion is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies from urgent fragments to luminous, clause-rich cartography lines. Information density high; each sentence usually advances setting + metaphor + interiority simultaneously. Minor paraphrase loop on “permeable barriers” phrase (three close repetitions) but does not dull closure. No mixed metaphors; bioluminescent logic stays internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentence often layers archive, weather, body, probability metaphor. No loops or synonym churn; mixed metaphors avoided (“rainlight and fire in one film” is coherent). Rhythm breathes—varied sentence openings, paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Occasional elevated diction (“lucid contradictions”) justified by narrator’s academic lens; does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry high-density figuratives yet vary in length and avoid loops; mixed metaphors (“bridge they found to the shore they lost”) are earned by emotional logic; occasional elevated phrasing (“cultivated estrangement”) fits narrator’s self-mythologizing; no artifacts obscure causality or dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: no loops, scaffold, or filter stacks; each sentence layers image, body, and mythic reach. Metaphors interlock—“tideline bruise,” “ledger as skin we grow back”—without mixed logic. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “between breaths.” Minor density spike mid-paragraph where three metaphors stack (“brown galaxy,” “harbor within a harbor,” “wrist corsage”) but the pattern is taught and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Metaphors are dense but purposeful—each extends the rail/ivy logistics conceit; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates from long freight-train sentences to platform-staccato when the queue forms. Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances story, character, or atmosphere. A single near-purple phrase—“whisper adjusting its coat”—is earned by prior pattern and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: every sentence layers sense, metaphor, and forward motion—"tasted its grammar ripple through his skin" does three jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. One mixed-metaphor risk—"coin laid on tongue of quiet"—but fits lyric register and is paid off by ring-as-lozenge image. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with pressure; no scaffold sentences or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layers accrue like regret but never obscure causality. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—no template cadence or filter-verb stacks. A single mixed metaphor (“smoke that forgot it was once fire”) is earned by thematic smoke/seed logic. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase; each sentence advances knowledge, image, or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence can stage, sense, and symbol (“chalk the pier with soft constellations, mapping quiet pockets where footsteps cancel”). Metaphors stay coherent within maritime acoustics; no mixed vehicles. Sentence rhythm accelerates toward the regatta halt, then lengthens into the hush. One paraphrase loop—“joyful sorrow” named then felt—dulls momentarily but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm mutates with pressure—short clauses flare during arson, then elongate inside the whale-archive. Metaphors stay physically coherent (curtains burn before stone mouths open). One tiny loop: “archive of inhalations and exhalations” could have lost one noun, but the density justifies the breath-pun. Closure line is scaffold-free and propels outward.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; mixed metaphors (“aurora drowned in a basin”) stay physically coherent. Rhythm varies from tidal sweep to single-word percussion (“Consent, I said”). Near-loop “drumming on everything” is motif, not artifact. One scaffold phrase—“quietly rebellious even against grief”—could compress, but it lands early and frames motive. No clarity loss at closure; final lantern image is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and stress to mimic breath: long labyrinthine clauses calm, fragments spike during vent failures. Figurative language is selective—”echo chased itself uselessly, a dog biting its tail”—and never clutters high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffold; each line advances sound, stakes, or atmosphere. Clean copy, precise verbs (“rapping the coin along a panel until the pitch softened”).

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: “dot moved like a measured heartbeat” does three jobs (light, pulse, pacing). Metaphors stay within water/light domain, coherent. One near-loop: “stillwater tension…instrument…hum” could compress. Zero filter-verb stacks; actions stay in strong verbs. Closing line earns resonance without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and musical—“iron filings flirt,” “blue threads for lines of sight.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence twins image with stake. One mixed metaphor: “forests of second thoughts” (spreads like fungi earlier) is minor. Final line attains Charged Poise through rhythm and monosyllabic landing: “We will cradle the town until it chooses itself.”

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences braid action, metaphor, and emotional tilt (“whale lifts and falls beneath me, shaping paths with muscle like underwater weather”). No loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift; occasional adjective richness is justified by lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from long breathless lines to clipped “Witness, he says to the broom.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors are purposeful (iron scythes that never finish harvest) and stay coherent. One negligible filter verb cluster in “he begins dramatically narrating” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from hymnal cadence to breath-beat: “ cathedral to throat / lanterns line / older idea of water.” No template cadence or synonym churn detected; metaphors stay coherent within the synesthetic cloud logic. High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and world rule (“the ice does not crack; it reconsiders”). Minor scaffold: “the poet pauses, hears…” is a soft filter; one such instance does not dull momentum. Closure line is lean and image-based, sustaining propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level density is high: “paints the breast with smoke water and milk lime, not for color but for texture that teaches air where to travel” performs three jobs—action, motive, world rule—in 24 words. No synonym loops; metaphor vehicles stay glass-specific (arterial fault, seam of ore). One minor scaffold: “bartered awakenings” is repeated four times—purposeful refrain, but the final instance could have been pruned for freshness. Artifacts never touch closure beat; reed hum and child laugh land clean.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic yet varied; sentence lengths create visual waves. Information density high—each sentence does double duty (e.g., “dust listens as if preparing to confess” advances atmosphere and stakes). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Minor hairline: occasional stacked modifiers (“quiet crown of mined glass”) but they serve the lyric pattern and do not obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate without algorithmic pattern; sentence openings rotate from participle to noun to verb. Information density is high: one sentence often fuses tool, emotion, and world rule (“grammar of lungs after loss”). Only hairline slips—“quiet vows” skirts abstraction, “subdued ardor” is slightly self-diagnostic—but both are re-anchored by tactile follow-through. No loops or scaffolding; no mixed metaphors; closing line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Figurative density is high—almost every sentence carries an extended metaphor—yet the pattern is taught early and sustains the cartomancer’s voice. Occasional mixed metaphors (“constellations waiting to fall into meaning”) slightly blur physical logic. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and syntax. Punctuation is clean, pronouns stable.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Almost every sentence carries double duty (image + concept + motion), yet three stacked metaphors in one late clause (“thunderheads caught in the throat of a bell”) slightly blur sensorium; no loops or paraphrase clutter, and propulsion remains intact through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Figurative layering is dense but purposeful; mixed metaphors (pollen of letters, day loosens buckle) remain internally coherent within the library’s vegetal-mechanical logic. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One template cadence appears—“gathers glints… gathers dusk… gathers courage”—but it is pattern-taught and paid off as the shadow reconstitutes. Closure beat is uncluttered, ensuring the final splice of thread into cataloged dream lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Varied sentence lengths create a read-aloud rhythm; high information density—one line often does two jobs (“I swept broken glass and gathered the empty vials, keeping one to remind me that faith without care becomes a blade”). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is spare, pattern-taught early (“misty workshop under stars” reprises in the final hush), and paid off. A single mixed metaphor—“charisma a torn net catching scraps of promises”—is allowed under peak pressure without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid algorithmic patterns. Information density is high—“pain salts the floor with stars” does triple sensory work. One near-loop: “meteor hush” is repeated twice but reweighted at closure, so forgiven. Metaphors stay coherent within the lyric logic; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “I need to know what the scar remembers” is slightly explanatory, but immediately grounded in the coffee-ring examination.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences perform double duty—advancing metaphor and tactile action simultaneously (“perforations pulsing… adhesive holding together what could not otherwise be adjacent”). Figurative layering is high but pattern-taught and paid off, avoiding purple overload. A few near-loops (“letters that never learned to arrive… forgotten lyrics might finally find their tune”) are purposeful thematic echoes, not artifact. The closing image is crisp and uncluttered, propelling the reader outward.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between incantational anaphora and crisp monosyllabic closures; paragraph cuts coincide with image shifts. Occasional metaphor density in adjacent sentences (“ash on its feathers,” “star-salted mantle”) flirts with overwriting but remains coherent under lyric mode. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; information density stays high. Closure line is clean, resonant, and free of artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: one sentence often sets scene, mood, and physics (“dune’s glow brushing his boots with pollen colored like drowned stars”). Occasional modifier stacks (“fractured lullaby,” “divergent archive”) flirt with purple but serve voice. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Final third clean, allowing 9-band reach.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences layer concrete nouns and active verbs. Occasional purple clusters—“mist lifts like thin shawls,” “twilight blooms like a bruise”—but metaphor logic stays consistent. No paraphrase loops; one near-repeat of “gentle persistent.” Figurative muddle absent from closure beat. High density overall, but elevated register occasionally distances urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence music is varied and propulsive; only two adjacent metaphors slightly over-layer (“velvet fear,” “fallen stars”) but clarity survives. Density is high: each sentence advances image or motive. No loops, no synonym churn, no register drift into academic diction. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly. Minor risk of overwriting in “seraphically mundane” but context justifies coinage.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences deliver world, metaphor, and stakes ("edits crawled like ivy through dynastic lines"). No scaffolding or synonym loops; metaphors stay physically coherent. Minor register drift—"conceptual repricing" diction nudges academic in closing line—does not obscure closure. Ear-test rhythm holds; paragraph cuts are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates from long tide-swell sentences to staccato tap fragments, propelling without scaffold. Figurative density peaks in “mirage paved with eels” yet stays legible. No synonym loops; “tides still rehearse old griefs” only grief mention. Minor filter verbs clustered mid-story but serve as breathing space before data crush.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety and muscular verbs propel—skids, scored, clambered, coaxed. Figurative layering is dense but coherent: “ribcage without a heart” fits the bay’s anatomy, “algae on dark water” fits the slow light bloom. No mixed metaphors in peak beat. Micro-loop only in “breath is the ember’s ally, not its enemy”—a single permissible echo that sharpens rather than drags. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with ritual: long anaphora of “Heat for eight breaths, cool…” mirrors spring pulses without algorithmic drum. Mixed-metaphor risk—“middle music whose possibilities trembled like light in shallow water”—passes because “music” is already literalized by sap-voice. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances ritual or stakes. Final line’s “rearticulated, a living joint” offers textural specificity that recharges earlier scaffold metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “ash brittle corners,” “spray swaggering higher,” “autonomous heart” each do double duty. No loops or paraphrase; every sentence advances. Figurative layer is dense yet coherent—sea optics, botanical growth, war tech—because motifs braid around exposure/shelter. One clause (“pearl of stillness, made by grit and time inside her”) risks minor formulaic note but is earned by prior somatic mapping. Reads aloud with tidal cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lines are dense but breathe: “wind unspools its long hush,” “clock coughing sand.” One paraphrase loop—“the world widened around each heartbeat / the clock coughing sand”—drops it 0.1. Metaphors stay internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. Peak beat at ink-crossing keeps propulsion without figurative muddle. Clean proofing, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: every sentence layers archive-body-city-snow-grammar. Metaphors are internally coherent (library lungs, capsule ribs) and never mixed. No scaffold loops; each image advances either temperature or secrecy. Peak beat “I pressed send” is unadorned, allowing the network’s breath-hold to resonate. Minor overworlding in “dizzying quiet” phrase is earned by repetition that reweights at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.5)
    Metaphor density verges on purple (“star milk into the furrows”; “cradle with claws”) yet pattern is taught early and held, so −0.3 for density, not −0.7. A few template cadences (“He transliterates emotions…”) recur without fresh pressure, −0.2. Mixed metaphors (“wore his bones like windchimes”) briefly confuse physical logic but recover within the line. Otherwise syntax is varied, information-dense, and propulsive; closure line is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary from percussive spondees to airy caesuras, mirroring dome echoes; no scaffold loops, mixed metaphors, or filter-verb stacks. High density—“inked thunder,” “bleach real color as surely as gossip bleaches kindness”—advances both atmosphere and argument.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Figurative density is high yet purposeful: every metaphor is a tool—velour hush blankets sound, mothlight fans scatter memory. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay acoustic or celestial. Scaffolding is minimal; sentences carry double duty—”silver constellations / path for a sound.” Read-aloud rhythm breathes with ritual pacing, climaxing in the single-line lullaby release.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-zero scaffold; each sentence layers job triplets (image + motion + emotion). Metaphors are coherent—tide, ribs, banister—no mixed vehicles. Variation in sentence length mirrors breath cadence. One micro-loop: “the hush… the hush” but serves as taught pattern, not artifact. Closure line is clean, concrete, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density is high—each sentence advances image, stake, or tactic (“Its glassy face kept the last light of prayers, but its back held the dust of names denied their bodies”). One mixed-metaphor risk—“sky is a peeled fruit, its rind hanging in cracked auroras”—is justified by the lyric register and re-weighted at closure. Minor scaffold: “I came… I came…” repetition at open could be trimmed but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Information-dense lines—“dates grow like fruit, futures like blossoms”—do double duty (world rule + metaphor). Figurative chain stays coherent inside orchard physics; no clashing metaphors. Occasional poetic stacking (“lime turned honey”) but pattern taught and never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase churn; opening anchors voice instantly; final line lands resonant image without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: single sentences do world-building and advance causality (“Out of my pocket I pulled the muscovite geode sliver… it felt like a key, and the door was breathing”). Metaphors are cohesive—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “we would devise a choreography … each step a rule, each breath an instrument” restates intent without new pressure, a −0.2 artifact that keeps it sub-9. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences perform double duty—e.g., “I float on a mineral pool to ease my joints, letting the salt cradle me while the recorder blinks” advances action, conveys body, sets tool state. Zero paraphrase loops, zero mixed metaphor; only one near-purple stretch (“slow aurora of wonder”) forgiven by lyric mode taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences multi-task; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent within sand/cloth/time weave. One mixed image—“sand is a choir”—but fits accumulative pattern. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs propel. Read-aloud rhythm rises to bell ring then quietens, mirroring arc.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative language is selective—wind as careful hand, smile like a bruise—never clutters high-pressure beats. Information density is high: aspirin + coil reveal in one breath. Minor loop: “codes in accumulated snow” phrase repeated; does not obscure causality or closure, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “rain stitched the eaves” shows weather, sound, and metaphoric sewing in five words. No scaffold or synonym loops; each image is non-recyclable. Figurative density is high but patterned—textile and water vehicles interweave without clashing. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates across the ferry slide, then lands on the spare whistle—cadence mirrors arc.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong read-aloud cadence with purposeful enjambment; information density high (“mesh rattles a little, a quivering hush made of glass breath”). Occasional stacked epithets (“luminous harbor by moonlight”) flirt with overwriting but pattern is taught early and sustains tone. No mixed metaphors; tar/sun and tooth/star stay physically coherent. Minor scaffold: “rhythm of oars in water” repeated thrice; trimmed once would sharpen. Closure image is crystalline and unaffected by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “shelves drifted shoreward; when it sank, passages opened” compresses causality and motion in one breath. Figurative layering is purposeful—metaphors of tide, shell, tea cohere around liquidity and residue. Minor template cadence in three successive “I”-led sentences mid-story, but artifact never touches closure. Rhythm modulates with tide-rise urgency; final paragraph shortens sentences to mimic ebb.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; long breathless sentences coil into short beats (“We walked…then stood”). Metaphors are dense yet coherent—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often does two jobs (atmosphere + motive). Minor scaffold: “letters swell…edges scalloped like lilies” overlaps floral image twice; not closure-touching, so −0.2. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences multi-task: “I aim the scaffold at frequencies where their laughter turns brittle” advances plot, embodies metaphor, and sets up sonic payoff. Figurative density is high but patterned—sound metaphors braid through every beat—so never drifts into purple. One paraphrase loop—“power plays multiply like mold… dank and inevitable, soft at first then choking”—is forgiven because the image escalates. Final line “keeping bridges singing even during storms” lands with cadence-earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are disciplined—“pipes stood like silver birches” grounds visual analog without mixed logic. Information density high: one sentence slips ancestry, tool, temperature, memory. Clause variation and paragraph breathers match organ swell and release. No overwriting in peak beat; the prick is a monosyllabic release after textured buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence variation and sensory specificity keep momentum; imagery is lush yet information-dense (“gulls scissor the saturated air”). Few near-loop phrases (“the station hums like a wet animal under it”) but metaphor family stays coherent. No paraphrase stacks or filter-verb clusters in climax; final paragraph propels to charged image. Minor overwrite in middle stanzas (−0.3) prevents 9+ but never obscures cause-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is lush but flirts with density overload: three consecutive sensory metaphors per sentence across 200+ words. Vehicles stay coherent (light, music, bridges), avoiding mixed-metaphor penalty. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clauses propel. Minor scaffold: “luminous disbelief ribbon through my ribs” could trim to “disbelief ribbons my ribs,” but artifact does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (“We rewrote our algorithm so the timing weights matched grief, and the stone sentences started to sing back”). No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (whale-dome, star-pulses-lungs). Read-aloud rhythm varied; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Only hairline slip: “stone remembering a lullaby” edges toward mixed metaphor, but the emotional logic is earned and does not blur closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence advances image or tactic—“seed unfurls a mouth of tiny sieves” does object-work and action-work simultaneously. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (armor/hush, helmets/apples). Rhythm accelerates with parataxis during unbinding, then breathes into longer cadence for the blank-sky closure. Minor filter verbs (“she senses”) are voice-motivated and sparse; no artifact touches the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from propulsive anaphora to hushed single-beat fragments; no template cadence. Metaphors are precise—maze-veins, scar-doors, bell-in-marrow—never mixed or contradictory. Information density is high: one sentence often layers time, body, and covenant (“I press the maze into my wrist…”). Only micro-loop is the echo of “root-bound / braided / pinned,” but it works as incantatory recurrence, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene temperature—propulsive during root-snare, hushed during graft. Figurative layering is dense but patterned: every metaphor is a form of stitching, inlay, or weaving, so coherence holds. One mixed image—“laugh stumble like a foal”—slightly jars amid bone-wood lexicon, but it occurs mid-text, not at closure, so artifact penalty is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences perform double duty: “The scrap prickled my thumb, as if asking whether I had finally fallen to souvenir work” advances plot, reveals vocation, and carries metaphor. No paraphrase loops; each paragraph adds new angle of cloth, map, or memory. Metaphors stay coherent—stone as choir, valley as patient—without mixed vehicles. One tiny scaffold: “confidently uncertain” is repeated descriptor rather than shown contradiction in-scene, a minor fleck.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density: each sentence layers image, action, concept—“coil tastes salt, tastes ozone, tastes absence.” No paraphrase loops; every clause advances. Metaphors are internally consistent—rails as bowls, fruit as candle—without mixed logic. Rhythm varies: fragment “a soft slope instead of a cliff” contrasts with complex “thresholds as amphorae that pour their shape forward.” Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs. Zero typos or pronoun drift. Scaffolding removed; no boilerplate.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences multi-task: “The alloy comes out as a small, cooling loaf, stamped with a tide mark no storm can erase” advances plot, object state, and theme in one clause. No synonym loops or scaffold; metaphor stack is disciplined—each image extends the maritime-clockwork conceit. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from whale-breath cadence to gear-tick staccato without drum-beat monotony. Line-level artifacts are absent; clarity stays pristine through the final window opening.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: every sentence carries double duty—image + interiority, or setting + theme. Metaphors are daring yet coherent: “corridors intersecting the caverns like knuckles inside a glass hand” sustains the body-geology conceit without mixing. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; information density stays high. Minor register elevation (“conceptual repricing,” “Earned Stasis”) is voice-motivated bureaucratese and forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances image, guilt, or action; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Metaphors are controlled—dragon teeth, river-scale tape—each re-enters to tighten pattern without cluttering. One mixed vehicle (“rib cage flexed” after “lung lifting”) momentarily blurs anatomical logic, a hairline artifact. Final paragraph’s cadence shift—accordion sigh relearning size—lands clean, recharging earlier bellows imagery and sealing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences advance atmosphere or choice without scaffold. Figurative layering (“bridge of patience crossing uncertain water”) is purposeful, not purple, and drops away at the climax for clarity. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; pronouns and tense stable. One strained metaphor—“lanterned spine”—is fleeting and does not dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Figurative density is high but patterned early (velvet/ice/stain/root) and paid off; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts coincide with stake shifts. Minor scaffold: “the promise loses its glow” is abstract, but glow is reified by ribbon of light inside violin—accepted as lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional and world-rule data. Zero loops; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes—long cadence for aurora descent, clipped brush-stroke for final color. Closure line “lucidly watchful” echoes opening without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density—single sentences toggle between tool-use, weather, and philosophy without scaffold. Two minor template cadences (“I…then I…”) in mid-section and one mixed metaphor (“clouds lean like sheep”) keep it from 9-band; neither touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric density high yet information-multitasking: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual freight without paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay internally coherent (magnetic grotto = attracts thought) and mutually reinforcing. Minor scaffold: repeated “he said” tags could be pruned, but rhythm demands the whispered attributions; they read as chant cadence rather than boilerplate, so artifact status is waived. Closure line is razor-clean.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers new pressure (dust-date, braid-boundary, ash-taste). Metaphors are coherent—bone ledger, cruel accordion—and never muddle causality. Rhythm accelerates into single-word beats (“I hum a tally”) then exhales into longer clauses mirroring circling gulls. Information density is high yet remains oral-legible; no filter-verb stacks dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences do multiple jobs: “I set it back, because not everything precious needs relocating” compresses choice, theme, and cost. No loops or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse and coherent. One mixed metaphor—“architect’s patience” applied to a spire—barely grazes clarity. Opening and final lines are propulsive and earned. High density without clutter satisfies the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry triple duty—e.g., “Their small suns would climb into the wind like soft-spoken stars with errands” advances image, stakes, and tonal metaphor simultaneously. No scaffold loops; each noun is specific (“weed-brown pilings,” “sailcloth ledger”) and each verb kinetic (“slipped,” “sledged,” “folded”). Figurative language peaks at the climax yet stays coherent: the “shifting dusk that stained the edges of things with rest” sustains the color-as-sound motif without mixed metaphor. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, and the final line’s monosyllabic pulse (“I did not hide”) provides cadence payoff after lyrical elongation.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence does two jobs—world, emotion, metaphor—without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned and coherent: amber tears, starling coins, burned chimes; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Proofing is clean; pronouns unambiguous. Only hairline slip: “templates” of “cast lots” repeat twice in close proximity, but the cadence is voice-motivated and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density—each sentence advances image or stakes; metaphor strings are purposeful (gnats, mica, frost) and cohere into a single optic system. One paraphrase loop—“the echo of sacrifice… echo of sacrifice”—drops it 0.1. No mixed vehicles; physical logic holds (light crystallizes ribbon-dust). Final line varies rhythm, giving cadence release. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense but each metaphor services the central instrument: bell, water, sound. One mixed metaphor—“sky tugged back” versus “thread snap between moon and salt”—is minor. Information density high; sentences carry two jobs (image + causality). Closure image unobstructed.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “badge sits on a heart that still hears the chime” advances character, metaphor, and stakes in nine words. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layer is dense but patterned early (“mirrored hush”) and pays off in closure, avoiding artifact penalty. One strained metaphor: “barnacle made of paper” is mixed, yet it occurs mid-scene and does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors are interlocking而非contradictory: armor/ring, lattice/breath, shore/tide—each extends the logic-intuition armature. Information density is high; every line adds sensory, intellectual, or emotional layer. Minor overwriter alert: “ancient freshness breathed… into her ribs” is almost purple, but the physicality of ribs just rescues it. Final third is clean; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers job, sensation, and metaphor without scaffold.  No loops, no template cadence; openings vary.  Figurative language is disciplined—arbor lung, sky mask—each reappears to charge closure.  One near-muddle: “radio static clears” thrice; slight rhythmic over-repeat, but pattern serves bell-like structure, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “salt to tongue and sweet to breathing” packs taste, body, and metaphor in five words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Metaphors stay coherent—jar, chimes, fans form a wind-instrument motif that never contradicts its own physics. Only micro-slip: “a tidal alphabet” is slightly strained, but occurs early and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances sonic stakes or bodily motion. No loops; no scaffold. Figurative control is extreme—mixed metaphors are avoided by keeping every vehicle in the wind family. The only hairline slip: “sliver of midnight” for baton is faintly stock, but it occurs in an early orientation line and never touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional metaphor crowding (“glittering needles that drew maps on our tongues”) never loops or contradicts physical logic; final image remains clear, no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence alloys image with causality—“heat bent toward the emptiness” advances both furnace physics and metaphysical aim. No loops or synonym churn; mixed metaphors are purposeful (furnace-lungs, star-slag). Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“tasted iron”). Minor overwrought cadence in the triple-alliteration line “bishop’s men with their mouths set in prayers” keeps it from perfect clarity, but the closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density—each sentence moves image or stakes; occasional lyrical stack (“serenely electric,” “glitter becoming geometry”) risks purple but stays pattern-true; zero loops or scaffold, propulsion clean through the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful—starlight as sieve, rope of echoes—supporting the accumulative/textural design without cluttering causality. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances pattern or stakes. Minor dock: “starlight threads down through holes in the ceiling as if the sky trawled for souls” is near-purple, but the metaphor is anchored to the grotto’s physical ceiling and does not obscure action.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm modulates from long, hypnotic sentences to the staccato of “step, pause, shake hands, let go,” mirroring the arena’s instructions. One mixed metaphor—“whispers erupt knowing”—is earned by the surreal frame; no loops or scaffold, high density, and the final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; each sentence twins sensory payload with causal push—“projector hum, chain link rings softly when it warms.” Metaphors stay within aquatic physics: refractions knife, plankton pixels, tidal sky. Rhythm accelerates into ascent without syntactic monotony. Final line cadence—solitary star / answering star—mirrors ring’s zero, closing sonic bracket.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; every clause adds sensory, emotional, or causal information. Metaphors (“floor was a sleeping animal”) are fresh, not stacked. One paraphrase loop (“I tell him… I tell him…”) is minor. No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the crash, then exhales—mirrors stakes. Artifact-free in final third; eligible for 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence variety is high; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Metaphors stay coherent—cables as veins, cave as lung—without overstuffed density. Information density strong: one line can do sensory + tool + memory (“copper housings… remembered”). Minor −0.3 for two adjacent “he” openers mid-revive sequence; otherwise propulsion clean.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density—“syllables tapping along the bone as if the towers themselves were youth again”—every image advances atmosphere or causality. Rhythm varies: long breathless accumulations vs. fragmentary beats (“I let go…”) that mimic echo fracture. One mixed metaphor (“black wreath against the bleached sky”) is minor. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “roots dangled from brick ribs” does world, body, and metaphor in five words. Rhythm breathes with paragraph white space; no loops, synonyms, or mixed metaphors. The final “phone clicked as if satisfied to hang up the storm” lands clean, propelling closure without figurative clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric drift mirrors dawn patience; fragment bursts (“Mist had collected there…”) mimic discovery pulse. Figurative density peaks at climax without muddle—“chrome of wind bells” is precise synesthesia. No filler loops; each sentence either advances salvaging step or charges atmosphere. Copy clean, tense consistent, pronouns anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear is musical; sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts are purposeful. Information density high—“I slid my chalkboard ticket through and heard a click, not mechanical, but like a thought deciding.” Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One near-artifact: “smelled of cedar and lightning” risks metaphor collision, yet the synesthetic leap fits the charged atmosphere and is paid off by closure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    High-density lines—each sentence layers job, tool, memory, motion. Metaphors are coherent within maritime palette; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “paint with light / paints with light” in adjacent clauses costs −0.1. Otherwise zero scaffold, zero filter stacks. Final third clean; closure image unmarred. Read-aloud rhythm pulses like ferry engine, mirroring scene tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose density is extreme yet every image pulls double duty: “dust like moth wings” is simultaneously visual, tactile, and foreshadows the door’s fragility. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends the last without contradiction. Rhythm modulates from long breathless clauses to the final short sentence that lets the valley settle. Only one scaffold trace—“impossible familiarity” could be shaved, but it occurs pre-closure and does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is dense yet buoyant—information dual-loads (e.g., “apples that have learned to sway like anemones” fuses botany with marine drift); zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, and the final “spores settle like first snow” crystallizes without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-zero scaffold; sentences carry double duty—description + concept, action + symbol. Metaphors stay internally coherent (shadow as cat, tea as handwriting). Two adjacent “then” sequences appear but cadence is purposeful, mirroring methodical archival process. No loops dull the closure image; final line is clean, propulsive, undiluted.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with pruning action: short snips alternate with long inhalations of mist and scent. Metaphors are coherent within arboreal logic—branches speak, moss has mouths, roots loom—no mixed vehicles. High information density: one sentence often carries scent capture, emotional state, and world-rule clarification. Only hairline flaw is a faint synonym loop (“color of wonder,” “brightening, leaf by leaf by leaf”) that murmurs rather than advances in the final third, keeping the piece just outside 9-band purity.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Each sentence advances image or causality: “threads cool as if remembering winter” does two jobs (temperature + memory). Metaphors stay inside maritime physics—no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the ritual, never drumbeats. Information density is high yet limpid; no reader-repair required at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory data with emotional charge (“salt blooms…as if rain had been arguing with the past”). Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Occasional template cadence in “I did X, and I would not Y” pattern, but it mirrors deliberate methodical stance so reads as voice rather than artifact. Closure image is clean, uncluttered, letting the hinge-hiss carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density—each sentence layers metal, salt, sound, and memory without scaffold. Metaphors stay internally consistent (radio hiss as shadow leaning). No loops or register drift; occasional lyric fragment (“math forgive me”) is voice-motivated and legible. Final third remains artifact-free, allowing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors the lightning/thunder interval: short breath-like clauses build toward longer, grounded lines. Figurative language is dense but patterned—each metaphor is revisited (coin-minted rain, sheet-music veins) so density reads as design, not overwrite. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each image advances either static risk or civic wish. Opening and closing lines are sonic bookends that re-charge the motif of sung silence.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Almost every sentence layers job: elevator creak = emotional tension, salt-rimed brass = backstory, “lantern warms a cabin without singeing the maps” = character ethic. A single mixed metaphor—“letters rose like frost ferns warmed by a distant hearth”—slightly chills the peak beat, preventing 9.0. Otherwise flawless rhythm, zero loops, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences compress under burner-beat, lengthen during star-gazing. Metaphors (clouds as parenting hail) cohere; no mixed vehicles. Information density high; most lines handle action + atmosphere + taxonomy. Minor synonym churn: “dusty” stars, light, grit repeated 4× costs 0.3. No artifacts near closure, preserving 8-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: information-dense double-duty lines (“Graphite dust blooms like night…”) advance image and map simultaneously. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay physically coherent. Micro-scaffold appears in two adjacent “I paint…” anaphoras, but the pattern serves cadence and is broken before closure. A single mixed vehicle (“held chord” / “held oath”) is forgiven for sonic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm modulates naturally; sentences avoid template cadence. Figurative layers are dense but patterned—light as refugee, net as greeting—coherent under accumulative design. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor risk—“river of light snagged like silk on a nail”—but physical logic holds within wind-current image. High information density, zero typos.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    High figurative density but patterned early (“driftwood nostalgia,” “goblet stairwells”) so forgiven; only one mixed-metaphor risk: “inland eclipse” still reads legible. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new layer to mirror machine. Final third free of artifact, allowing 9+ in other categories. One register drift—“conceptual repricing” is evaluator jargon, not on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “sky unbuttoned,” “woolen body of vapor” compress sensation and action. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is patterned early (trellis, braid, spiral) and paid off at closure. Sentence variety supports breathless ascent; no filter-verb clusters. Micro-scaffolding appears once (“we began at dawn…”) but advances momentum, stalls nothing. Closing line recharges “haunting” without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lines are dense but never paraphrase-looped; each image advances stake or atmosphere. Metaphors (bell-shaped stillness, salt taste) stay coherent and sensory. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“vouchsafe,” “conceptual”) is consistent with ritual voice. One near-template run—“pattern of tides, pattern of light, pattern of scars”—is pattern-taught and forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is dense yet breathable: “I shook a branch so gently the leaves only thought of stirring” performs two jobs—showing stealth and re-inscribing the orchard’s sentience. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image or tactic. Metaphors stay physically coherent within gear-orchard logic. A single mixed note—“penny bright mourning”—pushes metaphor toward the coin-edge of over-ornateness but is saved by sonic fit with bird-clatter.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentences avoid template cadence despite lyrical density. Information density high—each line does double duty (e.g., “froth along split channels” conveys both setting and polymer insight). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Final line “loosened grief… rejoin the human chorus” lands clean, propelling closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry triple duty: advance image, deepen metaphor, and keep spatial tracking. No loops, no scaffold, no synonym churn. Figurative language is patterned (glass, tide, frost) and paid off; mixed-metaphor risk is avoided because vehicles are mutually refracting. One near-purple phrase (“unread sugar”) is rescued by its agricultural twist in an orchard of books.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence sets fortress, rain, occupation, and aching tongue. Figurative layers serve multiple jobs—petrichor as both scent and memory medium—but never obscure causality. Minor template cadence in “I tasted… I tasted…” is pattern-taught and therefore earned. Final third free of scaffold; “kiln-breath quiet” is fresh, concise, and charges closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often sets scene, advances plot, and textures voice (“offering boards, bolts, and stories to the span”). Mixed-metaphor risk avoided; grain-as-language and clock-as-heart stay coherent. Rhythm modulates—staccato counts vs. legato starlight—supporting escalation. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “like” similes in elevator paragraph; not dense enough to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensor data, memory, and metaphor (“moonlight struck the dark of remembered rooms”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances calibration or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—mirror as ice, grief as limestone—without mixed-logic violations. Minor overwrite: “quaking reverie” appears twice; second use feels self-echo rather than escalation. Otherwise propulsive, clean grammar, varied rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lines multitask: “tokens shaped by forgotten hands, each bearing a taste of salt and ash, each emitting a tiny bell tone” fuses sensorium + backstory + foreshadowing. No synonym loops; metaphors stay physically coherent. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing moments”) fits narrator’s archivist lexicon. Momentum breathes—short paragraph cuts when gravity flips, longer coils inside grotto—creating visual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is compressed, high-density; metaphors stay consistent (organ of small gray pipes, grammar for trees). One scaffold pair: “silence is not the absence of sound but of listening” restates immediately prior image—minor loop. Otherwise zero paraphrase churn, no mixed vehicles; closure beat is uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long, breath-filled lines to the staccato of “the rail sang, the needle rose,” mirroring the widening quiet. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful; no mixed metaphors dull the final libation. Information density is high—each pawn lantern, ivy catalogue, or compass twitch does double duty. A single paraphrase loop (“catalogues: small catalogues…”) is too minor to touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, wave-like, with strategic staccato at hinge-release; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors stay physically coherent—sound as blossom, lung as stone—avoiding mixed-vehicle muddle. High information density: one sentence often layers sensory data, emotional tilt, and tool function. Micro-qualm: “scaffolding of constellations / scaffolding the city prepares to tear down” is near-identical phrasing twice in four lines, a tiny drumbeat echo that keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric density is high yet purposeful; every figurative stretch (cathedral of odor, braided hands) pays off in closure image. Occasional stacked modifiers—“generous drift of leaves”—risk purple but never break causality. Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with altitude: long glides for glide, staccato when bolts loosen. Metaphors are orchard-specific—“pears lift sighing,” “echoes stitch little ladders of air”—and never mixed; each vehicle extends the physics of the world. Zero loops, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks. Information density is high: one line can orient, foreshadow, and embody emotion—“the arrow tip warms when the arches hum, a small stubborn ember.” Only hairline: two adjectives in “gentle roar” could be cut, but the beat is not pivotal; closure line remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with the harbor: staccato noun clusters under pressure (“soot V, scorch, shallow V”) then longer exhalations when the grid is drafted. No mixed metaphors; every vehicle is meteorological (gulls as punctuation, containers as lungs). Information density high—one sentence can map wind, reveal character, foreshadow crash. Only hairline slip: “the kind a jet wash would carve” is slightly expository, but it is immediately grounded by investigator’s chalk.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    High lyric density serves information twin-load (sensorium + concept) without paraphrase loops; metaphors are coherent (prisms like minnows, hush as foal), rhythm modulates from long inhalations to the hinge-clause “Her chisel kissed marble as my bell kissed ice”; only hairline slip—“learning how to enter stone” borders on workshop idiom—keeps from 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes with flute phrases; sentences vary from fragment threads to long loom-like braids. No scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Information density high—each line advances memory, setting, or stake. Minor elevation in “thunder-echo range” repeats but serves cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with press cycles: long ink-metaphors contract to short star-gaps. Mixed metaphors are controlled—“column beaded by the rain” keeps metal & water in plausible workshop proximity. One paraphrase loop: “we kept printing, because the stars were not staying” restates the same cause. Else high density: one sentence can carry citrus scent, old promises, tympan creak, and swallowed truth without congestion.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pace: aurora paragraphs languid, release sentence single-coin clang. Metaphors stay coherent (silk, taffy, tuning fork) without mixed vehicle crash. One paraphrase loop minor: “extends brief encounters” idea voiced twice in adjacent lines, but elsewhere density is high—one sentence carries scent, memory, and motion. No artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.3)
    Rhythm breathes with heater hum; sentence variety avoids template cadence. Information density high: “lace unfurled across the glass like frantic ferns” does three jobs—visual, motion, metaphor. No mixed metaphors; vehicles (frost = ferns, hush = silt) stay separate. Zero scaffold/loop; each sentence advances image or pressure. Copy-clean; pronouns unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet textured: every sentence layers image, sound, or tactile heat while advancing the weave. Metaphors are internally coherent—silence as wool, distance as stacked cloth—no mixed vehicles. No loops or synonym churn; “raveling silence” recurs with accretive meaning, not repetition fatigue. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety is musical; no algorithmic patterning. Metaphors stay coherent—stone dovetails, white moths of dust—and never obscure cause/effect. Information density is high: one line can braid sensory cue, memory loss, and tactical consequence. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; final third is artifact-free, allowing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences deliver sensory data, spatial cue, and emotional charge (“shard refracts a thin beam from nowhere”). Metaphors stay physically coherent—threads, braids, looms extend textile motif without muddle. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Rhythm modulates: long breathy accumulations build to staccato beats (“I tap… I climb… I swallow”). Minor filter-verb clusters (“I feel,” “I taste”) are voice-motivated, not scaffolding. Closure line “let the breath tip me outward” is clean, propulsive. One typo-free read-aloud pass.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“lung with a held breath”—never congesting urgency. Opening and final lines are image-propelled; no scaffold sentences. Zero artifacts in closure beat allows 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and world data (“lamp… burns from a glass lantern wick whose secrets my grandmother smuggled in stories”). Metaphors are wild yet internally coherent—storm as reader, gyre as waltzing cathedral—never collapsing into mixed logic. Minor paraphrase loop in harbor-braid repetition costs −0.2; otherwise rhythm breathes with scene urgency. Read-aload ear shows deliberate variance in sentence length and stress aligned with beam rotation.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is organic, with sentence length contracting as the protagonist approaches the cliff edge. Metaphors are interlocking rather than stacked: stone/noon tea, sparrow wingbeat, harbor of currents—each reuses sensory material for density. No synonym loops; “light” recurs but in shifting grammatical roles. One mixed metaphor risk—“borrowed thunder” beside “startled bird”—is forgiven because cardiac rhythm justifies both. Information density is high; every line carries sensory, thematic, and plot weight.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings rotate across participial, subject-verb, prepositional phrasing. Information density is high: single sentences fold tool, emotion, and world-rule (“Its mirrors spidered with cracks… still knew how to point”). Only micro-loop: “listened… listened” in adjacent sentences on roof; does not touch closure. Metaphors maintain physical logic—moonlight as tuning hum, trees as green radiographs—no mixed vehicle collisions. Clean grammar, tense stable, zero filter-verb clusters under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm modulates from liquid orchard sentences to clipped loom-work—“lattice by lattice”—mirroring tension. Figurative density is high but each vehicle advances stakes (sap brightening, fruits exhaling cold sugar). One micro-loop: “I am emptied and full” is immediate rephrase, but the paradox is earned as conceptual cost. No scaffold or register drift; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Scaffold-free, high-density lines (“the backward spine she had sewn”) advance both craft and guilt. Mixed metaphors avoided; “detour had made a bridge” maintains coherent transport imagery. Only micro-loop: “within arm’s reach of midnight” repeats as opener and closer—acceptable as resonant bookend, not artifact. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo, propelling toward final harbor image without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyric density is high yet purposeful; metaphors are internally coherent (ivy as sleep-mask, bread steam as map). Occasional stacked modifiers (“braided the street,” “tiny flags of patience”) flirt with overwriting but pattern aligns with narrator’s cataloguing reflex. No loops or paraphrase stacks; information density strong. One comma splice in “I ring once, and the courtyard hushes…” unnecessary but does not blur causality. Final line cadence earns its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lapidary yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and concept—“lanterns strung from ribs of a dirigible” does world, body, and metaphor in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; synonym churn is avoided (each snow/ice image is distinct). One mixed metaphor niggle: “submarine crack” under ice is physically off, but the slip is brief and does not touch closure. Information density is high—e.g., “catalog cards laminated with hoarfrost curled like tired tongues” fuses object, sensory, and metaphoric work in a single clause.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level density is high: one sentence often layers sensory cue, metaphor, and tactical move (“I let the false starts multiply, tiny storms that wore his reefs down”). No mixed metaphors; figurative vehicles stay maritime. Minor scaffold: “listening stillness” repeated twice within 40 words, but it recurs at the closure beat where the echo feels purposeful. Grammar clean; pronoun chain never snags despite two male figures in play.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath-unit sentences for aurora flow, staccato tastes for beats. Information density high—“granulated sugar sticking to my tongue” does triple sense/setting/stake work. Two near-loop spots—“weather is memory and duty” echoed by Naira and later narrator—subtract without grave damage. Metaphors stay coherent within synesthetic logic; no mixed-vehicle crashes at closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence variety is strong; paragraphs breathe with scene rhythm. Minor scaffold: “the lock waits behind the dawn painting… the lock waits behind the frame… the lock’s face swings away” creates slight paraphrase loop, but it reinforces mechanical unveiling rather than dulling it. Figurative density is high yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. One filter-verb cluster (“I feel… I feel…”) in the drawing beat, but immediacy survives. Closure beat is clean, free of overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence cadence modulates from measured anapestic openings to stressed monosyllables at the reveal. No template runs; no paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high but purposeful—each metaphor (glass lungs, tongued floorboards, spindle as struck jar) advances either stakes or sensory texture without crowding causality. Information density strong: one sentence often performs setting, character quirk, and stakes (“I admitted I once gilded a promise I did not believe, and my wrists went weak…”). Minor −0.3: two adjacent sentences both start with “I” near the 400-word mark, creating a tiny drumbeat before the corridor walk; not enough to touch closure. No mixed metaphors; no register drift. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that re-cues the leaf-gold motif without repeating it.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear is musical: syntactic variety mirrors wind-sculpture turns, no template cadence. Information density high—single sentence can layer bell-metal, color-aurora, and communal respiration. Figurative language is coherent: “rivers of mist teased from stone” sustains water-light motif without mixed metaphor. Only hairline slip: “truth stayed simple” is abstract tell, but immediately grounded in aurora brightness, so closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long clauses during dusk setup, staccato sparks under shift. Metaphors are kept physically honest—“flames travel like careful handwriting”—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence seeds, maps, and slings vials. Tiny loop: “breathing” appears twice in adjacent lines early; does not recur at closure, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (anchor, sensory, metaphor). No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (“dust swirled like hush” anchors both setting and theme). One mixed metaphor “grainy rattle like wind inside a thimble” is hairline but doesn’t touch closure. Final line is crisp and propulsive, recharging “dawn benches” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies from long tidal clauses to staccato pulses (“six and five tell me”). No scaffold loops; each line adds new mechanical or sensory detail. Metaphors stay coherent—web, salt, rhythm—without mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often fuses valve number, cipher rule, and emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: single sentences do world-rule work (“harbor riddled with pockets of gravity”). Metaphors lean but stay coherent; one mixed moment—“room impossibly grows wider and warm”—is earned by surreal pocket physics. No scaffold loops; paragraph cuts test clean. Read-aloud rhythm varied; opening line anchors voice. Minor over-figuration in crystal descriptions but does not obscure causality or dull closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops, no mixed metaphors; each sentence layers map, sound, and silence in high-density shorthand. Figurative language is patterned and paid off—star-map creases return in the final wing fold—so it never obscures causality. Opening and closing lines are surgical, book-ending the hush with propulsive clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variety and rhythmic propulsion are exquisite; paragraph cuts land on image-turns that advance stakes. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor extends the acoustic motif without muddle. Minor 0.1 dock for two adjacent “garden” opens mid-text; otherwise zero loops or scaffold. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence breathes with escalating pressure and releases cleanly into morning light.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm mimics canyon delay—long caesuras followed by clipped revelations—propelling without scaffold. Figurative density is high but purposeful; mixed metaphors are avoided. One paraphrase loop (“the universe hums its secret song” appears twice) slightly dulls momentum; otherwise diction stays specific and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: every sentence does two jobs—image and causality—with zero paraphrase loops. Metaphors are coherent within the maritime/glacial physics (starlight as buoy-channel, candles as bruises). The only hairline slip is occasional adjective density (“blue slabs,” “honey bruise”) that could breathe more, but it never obscures the closure image. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from tidal long sentences to the final staccato step into night.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “season’s sweetness clinging… like fleeting syrup” performs atmosphere without stalling beat. Mixed metaphors are controlled—foam constellations, wooden anemone, living commas—each re-enters to charge closure. One paraphrase loop (“whistled again… pulses tapping the stone”) repeats sense but serves cadence teaching, so only a hairline deduction. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold; strong verbs (“kissing puddles,” “threaded between”) drive momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences outside stillpoint, staccato revelations inside. Information density strong: one sentence can deliver setting, backstory, and thematic cue (“Stillwater billed it as a kindness…”). No loops, one near-mixed metaphor (“dust on strings”). Closure line “leave the names out” is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “velvet rot and actuarial prayers” compresses council in five words. Metaphors are coherent—lightning as organ, glass as whale skull—and payoff in closure image. Minor template cadence in “variant allegiance” refrain (−0.2). No loops or scaffold obstruct clarity; paragraph cut test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sound, metaphor, and plot (“letting them braid the night”). No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay maritime/acoustic. Rhythm accelerates into storm then quiets into dawn without drumbeat template. Minor loop: “jarred verses buy soup and a place to breathe” repeats buy/barter concept; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    High metaphor density but each image advances texture: “sun… burnished the ice like vellum” prepares for later sonic “navigation.” No mixed metaphors, no scaffold; only minor filter verb (“I felt”) could be trimmed, not abundant enough to penalize.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety propels; no scaffold loops. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early (“magnetite bones”) and paid off at bridge crossing. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via image. Minor register lift: “conceptual repricing” diction slightly above POV lexicon, −0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    High-density lines carry triple duty: “tide line of silt that paints the mistakes in brown” shows cause, atmosphere, and moral indictment in one stroke. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for crawl-space scrutiny, staccato for flood countdown. Only micro-slips: “stubborn heartbeat” on the mantel edges toward inherited-wisdom shorthand, and “iron, mud, and old promises” leans list-like, but these do not obstruct the closure image or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric density is high yet purposeful—“the dust itself remembered lullabies”—and never loops. Sentence rhythm mirrors clockwork: deliberate, tick-like commas that accelerate only when the melody finds itself. No mixed metaphors; storm and gear logic stay coherent. One paraphrase loop—“second opinion” repeated in adjacent lines—drops the score a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence music is varied; no template cadence runs. Metaphors are dense but coherent under the Accumulative lens (“basalt deciding to become a bird”). One scaffold pair detected—“keep flying, keep failing, keep ringing” is a rhetorical triplet that serves cadence, not redundancy, so left untouched. Information density is high: one sentence often shows tool, body, and emotional charge. No artifacts appear in the final third. Elastic band allows 9+ but capped at 8.7 because one mixed metaphor (“cathedral coughing”) momentarily muddies spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm varied, info-dense; occasional adjective clusters (“banked cinders of public grief”) verge on overwriting yet pay off in pattern. No loops or mixed metaphors; closure cadence tight, breath-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors integrate physics (“ice took a slow step”) without contradiction. Information density high: one sentence can place, act, and tilt stakes. Minor register lift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator language, not narrator’s—keeps below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lines are dense but mutually reinforcing; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors (“thread of before still tied… luggage that takes the shape of our backs”) extend rather than muddle. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from legato reflection to staccato crisis. Occasional elevated diction (“filigree,” “intonations”) fits the narrator’s lyric bent without register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet transparent: “night dry and crackling like silver leaves” fuses auditory and tactile in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, stakes, or philosophy. Metaphors stay internally consistent (vine training = relational training). One near-purple line “thorned by cold” barely brushes excess but is earned by character diction. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with paragraphic cadence. Closure image is clean, uncluttered. Within 0.1 of 9-band: disciplined figurative control under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud cadence is hypnotic, but metaphor density crests into occasional purple (“dunes hummed like glass ribs”) without teaching that pattern first. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances either atmosphere or tactile action. Closure beat is pristine: “a hush stood up in the middle of us” marries syntax to event.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lines are dense—“faces bloomed in grayscale,” “paper gears spun in cardboard presses”—but each image advances either memory-corridor texture or communal pressure. Rhythm is deliberate incantation; occasional stacked metaphors (“river, rib cage, street where lamps never burn out”) are justified as children’s improvised naming. No synonym loops or scaffold; every paragraph either adds a photograph, a body, or a weather threat. Closure line “the masterpiece is not the pictures but the space we made to linger together inside them” is clean, propulsive, conceptually re-pricing.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear is musical; sentence lengths undulate like the echo they describe. No loops, no scaffold; information is dense—“footsteps of long gone children, soft as chalk dust” does three jobs. Mixed metaphors (“meadow of replies”) are purposeful, acoustically coherent. Register stable; final line cadence earns its pause without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence does dual work—image and causality (“He chalked on the step of a headless wolf: Sing before you speak, then stop”). Metaphors are coherent within the tide-logic: fog as broth, gravel as teeth, tape as ear. No register drift; “obsolete recorder heavy as guilt” is the exact weight the prophet would feel. Information density is high yet breathable, propulsion carried by enjambed clauses that mimic the prophet’s stop-start memory.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates from tremulous fragments to decisive clicks; no template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent—clock hand as orbital drift, dust as “tiny ghosts rehearsing departure.” High density: each sentence advances atmosphere or action. Minor scaffold: “luminous ache” repeated thrice; does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between propulsive anaphora (“I sing… I sing…”) and quiet reflective fragments, mirroring pulse and rest. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “sunlight blazing like a promise we can touch.” Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances story or atmosphere. No scaffold, no mixed metaphors, no register drift—prose is lean yet lyric.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences layer action, image, and concept with high density; occasional luxuriant metaphor (“net through water,” “hive of clocks”) flirts with overwriting but never loops or stalls propulsion; clause variety keeps ear alert.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty (image + motion + metaphor) without crowding: “the ground tipped, a hinge remembering its promise” fuses physical action, emotional turn, and world rule in twelve words. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; only two near-adjacencies (“listened correctly / listened” and “garden listened / fox’s ear”) are forgivable given the echoic motif. Metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent—bones, stars, botany—so figurative logic never snaps.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is high-density, lyric, and read-aloud fluent; figurative runs (“light rose without flame...”) stay coherent because physical logic is dream-consistent. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances pattern or atmosphere. Minor risk of purple in “condensed hush, bright as sleep,” but it lands within permissible lyric height. Closure line is uncluttered, sealing rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Information density is high: one line can map icicle drip to obsolete data lane while tucking spores into rust. Metaphors are internally coherent—honey, moss, amber form one living substrate. Rhythm accelerates during grafting, then exhales into the final pendulum image, mirroring physical labor.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates from susurrus cadence to the final monosyllabic toll, propelling without mechanical pattern. Figurative language is dense but patterned—each metaphorextends the liquid conceit, avoiding mixed-logic clashes. No scaffold loops; every sentence advances image or pressure. Minor overwrite in “river in me surged, grief and gratitude braided” keeps it from 9+, yet the line still charges the closure beat. Copy is clean; pronoun “it” always tracks to last named noun.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lines are multivalent: “dew stitched silver” does image work while foreshadowing the later sewing of sound. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances setting, metaphor, or beat. Figurative logic stays internally consistent—moonlight as reader of glyphs, spindle as oldest limb—without muddling causality. Opening and closing sentences read aloud with natural variation, no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax, propulsion rising as starlight bleeds and flares strobe. Figurative language is disciplined: “copper resembled a winter riverbed” is exact, not ornamental. No loops or synonym churn; each noun is specific (hoarfrost, broom-handle tripod, beeswax coin). Information density is high—every placement of rusty hoops or wire teeth doubles as ritual and cartography. Closure line breathes without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates long breath-units with hammer-beat fragments; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense—fossilized light, cave water scent, bird-that-imitates-chains—but each image advances either setting-tool fusion or stakes (echo = time = gear). Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay physically coherent. Minor scaffold: “angle of incidence, angle of retreat” is immediate paraphrase—drops the score a hair. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet limpid—each sentence layers image and metaphor without paraphrase loops. “Seams licked back with stories of cargoes” performs double duty: sensory action and world lore. Mixed-metaphor risk is flirted but controlled: whalebone reverie / metal tide / shingled hush all serve the acoustic-silence motif. Only minor scaffold: “some burdens need soft weather…” list could have been one sentence; still, it occurs early and does not occlude closure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “ash wood carving blank…pale as a tame shoulder” does three jobs—color, texture, symbolism—in nine words. Metaphors are coherent (rain=timekeeper, sugar=clock) and peak-beats stay clean. Minor scaffold: “here and gone” repeated four times; cost is −0.1, well below cap.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density—each sentence layers image and stakes (“song stripped to bones”). Metaphors stay coherent within the cloud-machinery physics. Variation in sentence length breathes with the carousel halt/resume. No register drift; “torque,” “vane,” “pontoon” fit scavenger lexicon. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “concertina of dust and confetti stars” carries three jobs—visual, tactile, and symbolic. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances pump-path or emotional gauge. Metaphors are coherent (thermal relays, tidelines) and avoid mixed-vehicle clutter. Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath of opener, staccato beats during valve-work, quiet cadence at lantern close.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates from long inhalations of sentence to the clipped “I did not ring the bell; I bore it,” mirroring the shift to acceptance. Figurative layers (clocks as sleeping cats, snow-fox) stay coherent and are restrained in the high-pressure final beats. No loops, synonym churn, or mixed metaphors; information density high.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density: “sundial face bore scratches that matched ledger initials I had found in mud” does triple duty—object, evidence, causality. Metaphors are coherent and risk-taken: “sun writes marginalia on everything” extends naturally to the shadow-verdict across the logo. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances story or reweights image. Minor scaffold: “like pages turning themselves to a verdict” and “like a heron landing” are two similes in quick succession, but both teach the pattern of natural inevitability and pay off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.0)
    High density: one sentence often does three jobs—e.g.,“snow rests…like sifted flour, gold beneath, white above” anchors palette, metaphor, and temperature. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is spare, patterned, and paid off (“listening bone” returns). Verbs are strong (“coax,” “lever,” “cradle”). Closure line is clean, propulsive, echoing “living sentence.”

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from tidal cadence to single-line pulses: “There will be no ship tomorrow.” Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent within textile and nautical logic—no mixed vehicle crashes. Information density high: one line can anchor time, body, and metaphor—“shoots arrive like green handwriting, curling around the thread until the path of grief becomes legible.” No scaffold artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: each sentence layers job—e.g., “oil-stained at the cuffs” shows class, theology, and bodily wear in five words. Rhythm accelerates during egg-split—“tapping a code that felt like apology”—then breathes into longer refrain. Mixed-metaphor risk (“palace wore a new shiver”) is justified by prior personification and does not cloud causality. One paraphrase loop (“We would move forward…onwards”) but it lands outside closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical without algorithmic repetition; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Information density strong—one sentence often layers tool, memory, and moral calculus (“sand was ballast, memory, and polish”). Two minor metaphor muddles (“private sky” / “bass string sleeping”) but never at climax. No scaffold loops; coin, sand, thread reappear with changed function rather than synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence variety and textured specificity (“domes of slow lightning,” “dust petals… drinkable day”) yield high density without purple overload. No mixed metaphors; stacked figuratives serve nebula logic. Occasional alliterative closeness (“soft applause across the quiet sigh”) is pattern-taught early and earns payoff at closure. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“coax,” “braided,” “refract”) propel motion. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm varies: opening spondaic thunder, then liquid clauses that mirror watering pipes; no template cadence runs. Metaphors (“glass roofs turned gold with wings”) are precise and never mixed. Information density is high: one sentence often sets scene, emotion, and stakes. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor elevated diction (“spectral mentorship,” “conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated and taught early enough to feel earned rather than grafted.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.4)
    Rhythm alternates between long tidal sentences and single-stroke fragments (“Heave for the living”) without algorithmic pattern. Metaphors are congruent—ridge as cut, bell as throat, pellets as swallowed secrets—no mixed vehicles. High information density: one sentence often performs spatial, emotional, and mechanical work. Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; even the repeated “pellet” accrues new moral weight each time.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with argument cadence; no adjacent paraphrase or template runs. Figurative density is high but each metaphor is swiftly repurposed (orreries as gardens, maps as honest gaps). Register stays within the cartographer’s plausible lexicon. One near-muddle: “pressure hides under smoothness” is rescued by immediate lake-crack auditory grounding. Closure line is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long inhalations for fog, clipped bursts for tapped replies. Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—“ripple became outline,” “bruises bloom”—each image advances the dust-animation beat. One scaffold pair: “the room breathed, and the pirate broadcast became a town square” could compress, but it does not recur. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closure line is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is dense yet breathable; every sentence advances image or ritual. No loops, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors—vehicles stay consistent (ash = weather, mask = vein-glass). The only friction is an occasional elevated latinate noun (“renunciation,” “impermanence”) that feels one register notch above the scatterer’s tactile idiom; minor, but keeps this from 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Density high: single sentences layer time, tool, and philosophy (“Time, once measured at sea, still bites back when you disturb its bones”). No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances map or gear. One mixed-metaphor risk: “canal scabs over with oil” vs. “abrasive calm” but fused within POV’s oil-on-skin experience, so forgiven. Final line’s monosyllables create cadence stop that mirrors clock halt.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and imagistic with high information-to-word ratio; metaphor chains (dust carrying “traveled stillness,” song as lantern) cohere under musical through-line. Filter verbs are rare; strong verbs like “folded themselves smaller” propel. A few scaffold phrases—“I told them,” “I asked them”—slightly stall momentum mid-scene; tightening two tags would sharpen. No mixed metaphors or looped paraphrase; final lattice image is clean, vivid, and causally tied.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near flawless: high density, zero paraphrase loops, varied sentence rhythms, and metaphor vehicles that stay internally coherent (“ground moon,” “porcelain tilt”). One microscopic mixed image—“salt wicks into the air”—is allowable under poetic license. No scaffolding or filter-verb stacks; every clause advances atmosphere or micro-choice. Closure image is clean, unmarred by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences carry double duty (image + conceptual tilt). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Mixed-metaphor risk in “choir of rust” and “tide hears me think” but the logic holds within the lyric-accumulative mode. Filter verbs nearly zero; strong verbs (“thread,” “tug,” “soften”) drive motion. One micro-repeat: “after revealing the secret” opener and echo—acceptable as deliberate refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    High metaphor density but vehicles stay coherent with the mathematical/thermal lexicon; no mixed metaphors bruise causality. Occasional scaffold (“the staircase is a listener…”) is brief and thematic, not momentum-dragging; final paragraph avoids artifact and lets the image breathe, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety is painter-brush varied: long pigment-loaded clauses alternate with staccato arrivals. No paraphrase loops; “watered by feel, as if reading braille across roots” performs two jobs—tactile and metaphoric—in one breath. One near-muddle: “saffron quiet deepened” is used thrice; the repetition is purposeful cadence but borders artifact. Otherwise information density is high without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence may anchor tide, yoyo timing, and planetary gear. Rhythm mirrors tide-breath without algorithmic pattern. One paraphrase loop (“slow exhale” appears twice) but functions as deliberate tidal echo, not scaffold. Mixed metaphors (“lighthouse inhaled its own beacon”) are coherent under reversed physics rule taught on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from sinuous cumulative clauses to staccato imperatives, mirroring maze turns. Metaphors are self-consistent (glow as needle, fear as mildew) and never violate the carnival physics. No filter-verb stacks; information density is high. One mixed vehicle: “confession tasted metallic, like biting a battery” is saved by concrete specificity and immediate payoff in the pink flash.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is exquisite; sentence variety and paragraph cadence mirror wave sets. Occasional metaphor pile-ups (“little seeds inside tapping their cages as if eager to be counted in”) flirt with overwriting but serve accumulative texture. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“clouds leaned like oars toward a singular swell”—is forgivable in lyric mode. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve with imagistic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances map, body, or sound. Figurative control precise—mixed metaphors absent. Information density high: “sunlight sheets the back of an elder turtle” fuses light, texture, motion. Rhythm modulates from hinge-sigh to whistle-crack without drumbeat monotony. Opening and final lines bookend with “sunwashed dread,” creating resonant frame.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density: “gilded initial pried from a shuttered abbey library” packs tool, theft, and institutional decay in nine words. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances map or motive. Metaphor chain (ivy / lapis vines / living margin) stays coherent, avoiding mixed logic. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” is earned by closure, not intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Figurative density is high yet patterned—“interlaced absence,” “columns like interrupted thoughts”—taught early and paid off in closure, so no overwrite cap applies. Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances image or action. Strong verbs (“wrest,” “seal,” “trace”) replace modifiers. Sensory layering (smell of tarnished ink, mineral dark) propels rather than stalls. A single mixed metaphor—“water holds its tongue as if schooling itself to remember”—is minor against consistent control.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet limber: one sentence can anchor time, body, and tool (“I inked the stamp… counting grains embedded by age”). Figurative layering occasionally risks purple (“algae stars”) but pattern is taught early and remains legible. No loops or scaffold; each clause advances knowledge or texture. A single mixed metaphor—“dappled resolve flowing over stone”—barely grazes closure, so artifact penalty is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density—single sentences fuse sensory, technical, and emotional data (“steam hoods shiver… pulse”). Metaphors are coherent within physics of salt, quartz, sky; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: creak–gnaw–hiss sonic chain propels opening; final paragraph eases into long breaths. Minor scaffold: “like” similes cluster in first third (−0.2) but none muddy the climax, keeping the score firmly in high band.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is restrained to 1–2 per paragraph, avoiding purple drift. Information density is high: one sentence can anchor time, tool, and emotional tilt. Minor scaffold: “the plan is simple enough to laugh at” is a touch self-conscious, but it occurs early and does not recur at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet limber: “the sieved hush through the grassed dunes” packs auditory and tactile data in five words. Mixed metaphors are controlled—hair shirt, counterfeit shade, brined alphabet—each revisited to pay off. One paraphrase loop (“I would not sell… I would not sell”) is intentional parallelism, not scaffold. No artifact obscures causality or dulls the final terrace image.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric density stays purposeful; no mixed metaphors or filter stacks. Minor scaffold—“furrowed hush” thrice—does not touch closure beat; information load remains high with rhythmic variation. Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; sentence variety strong. Information density high—“kayak took the water like a letter sliding into an addressed envelope” does three jobs in one image. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” notion appears in closing image but is felt, not academic, so forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose density is high—each sentence layers image, metaphor, and forward motion: “oars feathered rings of light, margins around sentences I could almost read.” No synonym loops or template cadence detected; metaphors stay internally coherent. One mixed image (“jaded wonder climbing my throat like smoke that forgot whether to warn or warm”) is allowed under lyric license. Final third clean; artifact-free, sustaining 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear shows variation: urgent enjambed clauses under metamorphosis, then slowed cadence for landing. Metaphors stay coherent within spice-astral logic; no mixed vehicles. High information density—one sentence can anchor time, scent, and emotional stakes (“Clove sparks braid my hair with smoke”). Minor loop: “paradoxically steady” appears twice; does not obscure closure. No scaffolding, no template cadence in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    High figurative density but each metaphor performs double duty: “blacker than the needles shadowing the moon” simultaneously paints cards and foreshadows the ravine of chimes. No mixed metaphors, no paraphrase loops. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for ascent, staccato for card fall. One minor scaffold: “forgive the hours...forgive the hours” anaphora is purposeful litany, not artifact. Closure sentence is pristine, free of ornament, letting pressure speak.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level density is high: “reality yield like skin begging to be stitched closed again” fuses tactile and metaphysical in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either seam progress or emotional reckoning. Figurative language is disciplined—mixed metaphors appear only when narrator’s own logic frays (“door puckered like scar tissue”) and serve the moment’s strain. One near-overwrite: “lung that had forgotten air” skirts cliché, but the next clause grounds it in pressure gradient dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors are consistent—celestial, textile, organ—forming a coherent sensory system. Information density high: one sentence often performs three jobs (anchors body, advances plot, textures atmosphere). Occasional elevated pitch (“grave grace,” “crystallized final moment”) is voice-motivated and pays off in closure image. Rhythm modulates from long surf-like sentences to clipped micro-choices under lava-light.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm modulates from hush to whirr without drumbeat; sentences vary in length and hinge on tactile verbs. Information density high: one sentence can paint blackout, betray occupation, and foreshadow code. Figurative layer is thick yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “light…warm in the cheeks” approaches cliché, but fits the domesticating-light motif and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from fragment to tidal roll; information density stays high without scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“ash from a furnace above measure”—slips register but occurs early enough that closure clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence variety and information density are high: “Rain fired upward from the cloud seas, bright with electric threads” does double sensory work while advancing plot. A few metaphor layers verge on excess (“storm-kissed wonder,” “weathered tattoos”) but never clog the decisive beats. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; pronouns stay clean through the single-scene choreography. Opening and closing lines are crisp anchors that could survive a copy-editor’s scalpel untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences multi-task: “glass chiming above us, water speaking beneath” layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work without scaffold. Figurative control stays tight—no mixed metaphors; vehicles remain mechanical or musical. Occasional elevated diction (“diplomatically fierce,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by philosopher-narrator’s idiom. Zero loops, near-zero filters; momentum breathes naturally through paragraph lengths and clause variation.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences do triple duty—e.g., “We braid rebar with drifted ivy, a welding of green and rust against collapse” shows action, metaphor, and stakes. Metaphors stay coherent (ivy as green cursive) and physically grounded. Zero loops, no scaffold, varied sentence cadence; only minor over-alliteration in “luminous fracture of reflected stars.” Closure beat is clean, no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences do triple duty (image + motion + emotional algebra) without purple drift. Varied cadence accelerates into corridor reveal, then exhales on the bench. One mixed-metaphor spike—“compasses lay down like tired swallows”—momentarily muddles physical logic, but closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, with purposeful anaphora and clause-variation; no template cadence drags. Metaphors are dense but coherent under accumulative design; mixed vehicle “library walking” is momentary, not closure-touched. High information density—each sentence layers task, object, myth. Minor scaffold: “I do not promise certainty, only luminous doubt” is restated thrice in variant forms; loop is thematic but still noticeable. No artifact obscures causality or dulls the final vegetal image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: one sentence often layers action, image, and metaphor (“I crushed indigo berries and let their blue bleed into a bowl of rain, watched the stain widen and forgive”). Rhythm varies; paragraph cuts carry emotional charge. No scaffold loops, no template cadence. Mixed metaphors are rare and functional (“compass listens like a clam”). Closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each line multitasks (e.g., “orchids hold their breath” conveys state, stakes, and atmosphere). Figurative language is pattern-taught (stars/greenhouse, decay/maps) and never muddled. Minor artifact: two adjacent sentences near the start (“I came for measurement... That habit of mind...”) slightly paraphrase the anti-drama motive, costing 0.3. Otherwise, rhythm varies purposefully, paragraph cuts serve emotional beats, and closure image (“dust lifts and resettles”) crystallizes the theme without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “scorched testament fused into the floor, an inscription of heat in pearled sand” conveys destruction, artistry, and forensic detail in one clause. Rhythm varies organically—long, cooling sentences for reflection; staccato phrases for discovery (“Far within, a door of metal slept”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere within thermal/craft logic. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “pauses” (three mentions), but never muddles closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose avoids loops/scaffold: each sentence advances character, setting, or theme (“frost on the panes fretted into lace, as if the room listened”). Figurative language is coherent—silence “curdles,” auroras “slide,” hearts “rectify distances”—with no mixed metaphors. High information density: “mapped heat drove the silent bows of our ice-harps” fuses method, object, and action. Final line’s cadence (“we are finally doing it right”) recharges the verb-motif without purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—every line multitasks (e.g., “sea grows patient and heavy, like an old librarian” fuses setting, tone, and character bias). Figurative language is coherent: glass “crazed as if the sea had tried to write,” plankton making “slow alphabet.” Minor overwriting in peak beats (“blade-thin seam where breath and brine agree”) slightly muddles physics but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose achieves high information density: “metal holds memory” conveys history, theme, and object function in four words. Figurative language is coherent (“stars floating… like distant coins” ties celestial distance to economic scarcity) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary (“Mara… set,” “During sanctions,” “She tapped”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., post-accusation pause before Mara’s response). Zero loops or scaffold; even dense passages (“breath and echo, each step rehearsed…”) propel momentum. Final line (“quiet amplified across the ridge like weather”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose achieves high information density: “bellows I stitched to my ribs” conveys craft, pain, and embodiment in six words. Figurative language is coherent—light as “pliable filament,” viaduct as “nebula”—with no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “pilgrim of sparks writing constellations where pigeons sleep” slightly dilutes propulsion, but rhythm varies purposefully (staccato breath lines vs. lyrical closure). Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet clear: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“flakes of emulsion began to disintegrate like ash”). Figurative language is coherent—bird calls as “ink dropped into water”—and avoids muddle. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with tension, and no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Minor deduction for slight over-density in mid-section (“hollows of cedar… torsos”), but closure beat remains sharp and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “quills stitched from carnival tickets” conveys craft, memory, and rebellion in six words. Sentence rhythm varies naturally—long lyrical strands give way to staccato urgency (“There it is, faint as a swallow’s apology”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image advances plot or theme. Figurative language is coherent (seeds as “fragile verbs,” chain as “promise”), never muddled, even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose density is exceptional: “kelp brushed the ribs of ships and the orchard scaffolds, and their greens whispered tin” merges setting, action, and synesthesia in one clause. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (aurora as “trembling veil,” trust as “spectral notch”). Minor deduction for two adjacent lines slightly overloading figurative weight (“battered marvel… thinning inside me”), but closure beat (“set the orchard to grow”) lands with clean propulsion. Read-aloud rhythm varies masterfully between liquid flow and staccato clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“Commuters glittered with phones and unshed words”) and varied cadence. Figurative language is pattern-taught (moonbeams as minnows, light as tide) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “dark aquarium glowing with petals” slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure remains sharp. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes (“Ice was loosening its grip on the rafters, clicking like timid fingernails”). Figurative language is coherent: glass as “stubborn mirror,” thaws as “kindly teachers.” Minor artifact: slight overuse of “because” clauses in mid-section (−0.3), but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors melting ice—cadence shift elevates without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“pages flaking like scabs” establishes decay and fragility in one stroke). Figurative language is pattern-taught (coral, tides, constellations) and payoff-integrated; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—e.g., “trembling certainty” introduced early returns as earned poise. Final line (“voice steadied like a rig”) crystallizes theme through profession-specific imagery without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict (“grains clicked in her braids like soft teeth”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (silence as clay, hush as syrup) and pays off in closure. No loops or scaffold—each image evolves (gold flakes become harbors; star becomes nail). Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in mid-story (“corridors where gulls once argued”), but clarity never suffers. Final line (“the booklet emptied its gold”) lands with devastating simplicity after rich buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose exhibits zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Information density is high—“composure holds the dust together” conveys trait, function, and metaphor in seven words. Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught (ice/sky, broom/music), never muddled in peak beats. Final line (“the courtyard agreed to be new”) resolves by recharging earlier motifs with earned freshness, and read-aloud rhythm varies naturally without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but rarely overwritten; metaphors cohere (rain as truth-filter, doodles as maps). Minor redundancy in “resonant hush” (used three times) slightly dulls momentum, and “ghostly legibility” borders on vague abstraction. However, line-level propulsion remains strong—sentences vary rhythmically, and every image advances atmosphere or theme. Closure image (“held in open hands and rinsed in the whispering rain”) crystallizes without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence layers image, character, and theme without redundancy. Figurative language is coherent (“luck has become a bar code,” “marbles like breadcrumbs that know how to wait”) and never muddled. Rhythm varies naturally: short clauses for tension (“He laughs, politely”), longer cadences for reflection. Zero paraphrase loops; every line propels. Closure image (“maze exhales with me as if counting together”) earns its lyricism through accumulated specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: “embered breath inside a helmet of frost” conveys warmth/cold, isolation, and profession in one image. Figurative language is coherent (time as “angular river,” station as “careful thought”) and peaks without muddle. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence propels. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in “holographic principles he had assembled from discarded cameras”—a rare abstract phrase in otherwise tactile prose—but closure remains unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “lanterns flickering like indecisive fireflies over water that smelled of rope and varnish” establishes mood, setting, and sensory specificity). Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (water as ink, silence as score). Minor deduction for slight overuse of figurative language in mid-story (“bruised the pages into maps”), but peak beats remain clear. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic resolution.

Figurative language is coherent—grease, water, breath motifs recur without contradiction. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line (“walk straight on water”) earns its lyricism through accumulated physical specificity. Minor deduction only for one slightly ornate phrase (“stone belly of the bleaching works”), but no artifact dulls closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose achieves high information density: “roots burrow through old atlases and find rivers that no longer flow, then keep going as if maps deserve mercy” advances setting, theme, and character in one breath.

Figurative coherence—silence “replants breath,” ash “drifted like moths that had outgrown flame”—never muddles peak beats. Final line’s cadence crystallizes the entire texture without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“shadows sharpened like careful pencil lines,” “bowl answered with a bell so round it seemed to bow”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and every line advances atmosphere or character. Minor overwriting in one beat (“the world dimmed to a blue of old photographs”) edges toward purple but doesn’t obscure clarity. Closure image (“carrying the quiet like a seed”) earns its lyricism through prior accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “pages scalloped where flame had licked and withdrawn as if respecting a line it could not read” does character, setting, and theme work. Figurative language is coherent (dragons as diagrams, walls as vocal cords) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in mid-text (“quarrels, caresses, grain dust falling like tiny rainstorms”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final lines achieve propulsion through syntactic variation and charged imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“tape thin fortunes across catwalk windows” shows method and stakes). Figurative language is coherent: light as music, secrets as dots, flow as tide. Minor density in high-pressure beats (“glass cathedral built for dots of light”) risks overwriting but serves closure. Zero loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies naturally to mirror tidal cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each line multitasks (e.g., “scabbed moons around a single blue sun” conveys visual, emotional, and thematic layers). Figurative language is consistent: river grips, tides, lakes—all water motifs serve the logic of flow vs. stasis. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; even repeated structures (Let there be...) are pattern-taught and payoff-driven. Final paragraph’s cadence shift (“not even breath”) clears the air without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density without clutter: “frost ferning the window, plucking at the boundary where glass meets breath” merges setting, action, and metaphor in one breath. Rhythm varies organically—paragraphs shorten as tension rises, culminating in the taut finale. No loops or scaffold; every image recurs with reweighted meaning (shell, mirror, silence). Minor deduction: one near-redundancy (“unbroken possibility” / “year I can still hum”) slightly softens propulsion, but clarity at closure remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose achieves high information density: each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“puddle turned into a door that knew my weight”). Figurative language is coherent (light as breath, guilt as heat) and pattern-taught early (“stones remembered light”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“I touched…”, “Arches multiplied…”, “Below me…”). Final paragraph’s propulsion (“floated only long enough… walked home… viaduct dimmed”) crystallizes closure without overwriting. Minor deduction for slight density in mid-section (“fractured timelines had not only split…”), but no artifact obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“guilt weighed less when shaped like an instrument”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (hush as filament, grief scoring lacquer) and payoff-integrated; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Sentence openings vary naturally; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “syllables collapsing into inhalations” slightly blurs sense, but closure image (“candle deciding to be fire again”) remains sharp and unobscured.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“pigeon broke… throat humming with a velvet motor”) and rhythmic control. Minor overwriting in “metallic as pennies” and “difficult taste” slightly muddles metaphor coherence, but never obscures causality. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence breathes with earned stillness, avoiding purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “crystal shadows gathered under the ribs of glass like quiet birds” does triple duty (image, mood, motif). Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent—light as revelation, scent as time-machine—with no mixed metaphors. Final line (“greenhouse remembered how to be quiet again”) resonates without overwriting, closing the cadence with earned stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or conflict. Figurative language is coherent (whale’s spine = “fractured calendar”; rope = “mobile sky of knots”) and avoids muddle. Minor deduction for slight over-density in mid-text (“coaxing a whale from clay… spine a fractured calendar… frayed coil… trailing breath like torn silk”)—four metaphors in three lines risk slowing momentum, though all serve theme. Final paragraph’s rhythm (“rope rides my shoulder… highways hum again”) perfectly closes the sonic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “glass ribs jeweled with salt,” “prints like commas,” “cracked honey” do triple duty.

Final line (“we keep each other”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence layers action, character, and atmosphere (“my fingertips sparked when I took it, the static netting us like spidersilk”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (static as diagnostic tool) and payoff-consistent (grotto translates “twitch” into “syllable”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“metronome of drips,” “careful lie of surviving”) slightly blurs sense but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “gulls edit the sky,” “sea making parentheses around the quiet.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (nautical/music metaphors) and pays off (“cranes like stars”). Minor overwriting in “map of cycles of compassion” slightly abstracts, but closure remains sharp. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final line crystallizes the core truth without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“reeds clacked until dawn like a language disagreeing with itself”). Figurative language is coherent—crystals chime, obsidian polishes horizons, sigil blooms like breath—without muddle.

Zero paraphrase loops; rhythm varies organically.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“Night spills its first ink” establishes time while evoking ink-on-page). Figurative language is pattern-taught (water as chorus, time as taffy) and payoff-earned (echo “looks like clear breath”). Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve rhythm (e.g., single-line “I do it by borrowing time…”). Minor deduction for one slightly overloaded metaphor (“bubble made of memory”), but clarity at closure remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“Eyes that never lived can listen...”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (drip = decimal, emotion = physical law) and pays off in closure.

Final line’s “road she could finally call home” avoids sentimentality by tying to prior “pulse-drawn” logic.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose achieves near-flawless information density: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“a trapped click fluttered out, like a bird that had learned to imitate chains”). Figurative language is coherent—echoes graze like shy animals, light scatters like shattered memory—and never muddles causality. Sentence variety mirrors thematic tension: short ticks (“The mechanism began”) punctuate flowing descriptions. Only minor overwriting in “articulated pauses” slightly dilutes momentum, but closure remains razor-sharp. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves near-perfect information density: “boundary-lessly trapped by the way paths folded back into themselves without edges” conveys spatial paradox and emotional state in one breath. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (whalebone → cord → unbreaking burden). Minor deduction for slight over-density in mid-text (“cargoes and winters spent listening” slightly generic), but closure lines (“grotto will keep breathing this whalebone reverie”) land with crystalline propulsion. Sentence openings vary organically; no scaffold or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but clear—each line multitasks (e.g., “pale as a tame shoulder under sawdust” conveys color, texture, and emotional valence). Figurative language is pattern-taught (cages, crystallization, thunder) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in mid-text (“dry and green as unfinished thunder”) slightly muddles sensory logic, but doesn’t obscure cause/effect. Final paragraph’s cadence (“Rain threads… kettle breathes… ash wood remembers”) achieves lyrical propulsion without loop or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)

Figurative language is sparse but potent (“stale air again,” “confetti stars, sweet and improbable”) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths mirror hydraulic rhythm—long build, short surge. One minor redundancy: “modest and exact” slightly paraphrases the same idea, but it’s outweighed by high information density elsewhere. Final line’s click “like a star learning a new orbit” pays off the sextant motif without flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose achieves high information density: “clocks slept like cats in cold windows” establishes setting, character, and theme in one image. Figurative language is coherent—hush as ice, rain as script—and never muddles cause/effect.

Zero loops or scaffolding; the opening’s “wistful station pianist” motif returns transformed in the closing image, creating resonant closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield: “The third is silence that tastes of pandan, suggesting a festival no one remembers attending” does atmosphere, character, and theme in one breath.
