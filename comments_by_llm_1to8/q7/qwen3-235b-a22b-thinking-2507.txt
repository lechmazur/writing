  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good information density, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "slow, inevitable dance of gravity and decay" followed immediately by "quiet truth of gradual transformation"; "patient transformation" then "ongoing, patient transformation." Mixed metaphor with humility that "kindles" yet is "warm and steady." These artifacts don't touch closure but accumulate enough to limit the score.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong specific details. Information density high in investigation sequences. Deductions for repetitive "steadily adaptive" phrase, some abstract phrasing ("drifting resonance" used multiple times), and occasional overwriting in metaphorical language.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows moments of beauty ("tears carving paths," "liquid moonlight") but suffers from repetitive structures and concept loops. "Unshaken marvels" appears four times without evolution; multiple sentences begin with "She'd" creating template cadence. The final third contains paraphrase loops ("silence wasn't empty; it was a canvas" restates prior material).

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dense, purposeful prose with strong information density—most sentences advance multiple layers. Good syntactic variety and rhythm modulation. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("silent scream from the deep that resonated in his marrow") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete. The prose serves the accumulative mode but occasionally tips into purple territory.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Strong moments like "the quiet itself became their declaration." Deductions for abstract phrasing ("whispered calculations," "scarce commodity"), some filter-verb clusters ("Elias felt," "Elias watched"), and occasional overwriting in figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid sensory detail ("Petals from night-blooming cereus drifted like pale moths"), though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("pilgrim of sparks tracing the faint luminescence"). Minor template cadence appears in "She felt...She believed...She needed" sequence, and some abstract phrasing ("spiritually curious ache") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("hedges breathed and shifted...folding time into origami shapes"). Some overwriting in extended metaphors ("tapestry woven thread by thread") and occasional register drift ("residual chroniton energy").

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in action sequences. However, several instances of elevated diction strain clarity: "scoured the earth barren," "shrine to forgotten joy," and template-like constructions ("She must...she turned...she dropped"). The metaphor "chains tangling around her ankles" works well, but "roots" as final word is predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("twisted shards of copper and brass, scavenged from the nearest shipwreck"). Some metaphor density in peak moments ("splinter in her soul") edges toward overwriting but remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong imagery and varied syntax, but suffers from overwriting in places ("fracturing it into liquid gold," "destiny's door" appears twice). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats without clear payoff. The closing image lands effectively, but scaffolding phrases like "not doubt that...but awe that" create unnecessary loops.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from abstract emotional labeling ("weighty lightness," "thoughtfully spirited flourish") and repetitive thawing imagery that loops without adding pressure. Template constructions appear throughout ("He thought of," "He felt," "He recalled"). The dramatic narration provides rhythm variation but can't overcome the paraphrase loops around grief/thawing/renewal that blur momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is good in descriptive passages. However, several instances of elevated diction ("vise of her fear," "electric hum of reclaimed agency") and some redundancy in the final third ("strength began with courage to be seen broken" restates earlier insights) impact momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("ambered hush, thick with the preserved silence"). The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks that mirror the storm's rhythm. Some redundancy appears in the middle section with multiple restatements of the silence-mapping concept that could be compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe overwriting pervades: "muffling all sound under a violet sky where the last light bled into indigo." Template repetition of "remarkably composed" (5 times) and "Unit 7" sentence openings creates monotony. Abstract assertions replace concrete imagery throughout, particularly in the revelation sequence. Information density is low with multiple paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong sensory specificity ("obsidian-like paving stones," "fracturing into a thousand tiny, liquid stars") creates atmosphere, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("resonant hush" appears three times, "crystal forecourt after rain" twice). The phrase "ambiguously clear" feels forced rather than organic, and some sentences strain with over-modification.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs: "knotted fingers, like the withered vines she tended" establishes character, setting, and theme simultaneously. However, paraphrase loops appear: "mended deceptions" concept restated across "she didn't deceive the garden; she deceived the Quantifiers" and "mended deceptions offered not as falsehoods, but as love." Template cadence in "She didn't...she deceived" construction. Final third stronger with "The maze sighed, blooming and withering."]

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("the hush of beating wings at rest") but suffers from repetitive phrasing—"mechanically warm" appears three times, "magnetic nexus at twilight" four times, "proving that time moves sideways" three times. Several sentences could be condensed without loss. The final paragraph contains unnecessary summary ("the obliging sky mechanic who'd moved heaven and time").

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high with most lines advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("liminal world suspended between ruin and revelation") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete. No significant loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though some passages border on overwriting ("auroral sorrow—that was the tone of her existence now"). Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions mid-story. The closing sentence, while thematically resonant, runs long at 40+ words without optimal rhythm control.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose maintains solid momentum with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm shifts between discovery and revelation. Some figurative language becomes overwrought ("ancient throat," "counting bones") and abstract phrases like "measured weight" and "crushing lightness" create mild opacity, though the closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "Reality yielded like thick fabric" and effective rhythm variation, though some passages edge toward density ("incremental fading of ink on fragile pages"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, particularly in the collapse sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several paraphrase loops diminish momentum: "ordinary magic" appears five times, "softly adaptive" four times without variation. Template phrasing like "beneath the hush of dreaming roots" bookends without earning its repetition. The prose has moments of clarity but suffers from abstract descriptors ("cautiously exuberant," "gently insistent") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose maintains strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously. Some repetition of "bronze quiet" and occasional filter constructions ("she detected," "she sensed") create minor friction but don't compromise clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("rhythmic groan of the storm," "spidery script"). However, several instances of elevated register drift ("accidentally prophetic ramblings," "vast, mysterious symphony") and some repetitive phrasing around light/shadow. The final paragraph contains unnecessary philosophical abstraction that could be cut without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("Dust motes hung suspended in the stale air"). Some register drift occurs when technical and mystical vocabularies clash, but momentum generally sustains through varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("mirrored horizon that doubled the sky's faint blush in liquid symmetry") with good rhythm variation. Some overwriting appears in the dense figurative language of nearly every sentence during climax. Template repetition in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple lines detracts from otherwise strong craft.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with effective rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. However, some overwrought metaphors ("sickly, darkening brightness," "curdling into") and repetitive constructions ("He + verb" patterns in middle section) create minor drag. The closing sequence recovers well with clean, propulsive sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong sensory specificity and information density, though "profound, audibly muted stillness" and similar abstract constructions occasionally slow momentum. The technical description of backward playing carries high precision, but phrases like "language older than words" edge toward familiar territory.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good information density, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("layered tranquility she cultivated daily"). Minor repetition of "lateral/laterally" and some abstract phrasing ("integrity in solitude was her creed"). The final paragraphs contain slight redundancy in stating the theme. Strong rhythm variation and sentence variety prevent monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. However, some elevated diction ("synesthetic grief," "molecular structures") and occasional density excess in figurative language during high-pressure moments. The "crystal shadows" repetition works thematically but borders on overuse.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs ("ties a new knot...testing if patterns could bend time's flow") and varied rhythm supporting scene pressure. Some figurative density in peak moments ("smooth as silk...rough as shattered pottery") and occasional template phrasing ("for the first time") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "ash-laden air catching the last notes like fireflies." Some paraphrase loops around the hush concept ("chronic hush pressed in," "chronic hush wasn't empty," "chronic hush didn't vanish"). Template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions appears but doesn't pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good information density, but notable issues: redundant phrasing around "half-truth" concept, some abstract emotional labeling ("affectionate detachment" repeated), and elevated diction clusters ("emergent property," "inadvertently facilitated"). Template cadence in middle section with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Strong specific details (Port Authority Survivor Benefits, tide charts). Deductions for repetitive phrasing ("cautious exuberance" appears twice), some abstract emotional labeling ("his shrewdness softening into empathy"), and occasional overwriting in figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions like "the crater's murmur was no longer a sound of loss but a lullaby for the living." Some paraphrase loops appear ("luminescent ache" variations) and filter verbs cluster in revelation moments, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm shifts during the climactic time-borrowing. Some density issues with stacked metaphors ("time felt different, stretched thin like spider silk") and occasional overwriting ("impossibly tall towers," "velvet sky"). Strong information density in key beats. The "*Clang*" and italicized "*uncaged*" provide effective emphasis without overuse.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("mathematics of emotion," "unified equation") and some repetitive constructions around the glass eyes' revelations. The phrase "ambiguous loss" appears multiple times without variation. Strong information density in the mosaic discovery sequence partially offsets these issues.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments of compression and rhythm variation, but repetitive use of "sapphire hush" (4 times) and some template cadence ("She knew... She wrote... She watched") create monotony. Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs, though some descriptive passages could be tighter. The opening and closing images effectively bracket the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some metaphor density in peak beats ("roots breaking through concrete," "quiet revolutions") but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor template cadence in the middle section ("She traced...She recalled...She'd dismissed") and one paraphrase loop about control being an illusion.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves density with most lines carrying multiple functions, strong rhythm variation, and evocative imagery. However, some template patterns appear ("She remembered... She needed...") and abstract constructions occasionally slow momentum ("testaments to her wryly earnest belief").

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose has rhythmic control and varies sentence structure effectively. However, several abstract formulations weaken immediacy ("magnify the everyday magic," "intricate, steadily unpredictable tapestry") and some repetitive phrasing appears ("unseen forces" used 6 times). The dissolution sequence when touching the pearl achieves strong sensory density.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("memories dissolved like salt in tide pools"). Template cadence appears in the "First, at dawn..." sequence and some paraphrase loops ("hope shouldn't be scheduled, but discovered"). Information density is strong in vision sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax and strong moments like "breath a ghostly plume." However, template patterns emerge ("He pulled...He pressed...He punched") and some overwriting in metaphors ("skeletal remains," "velvet darkness"). The "trembling certainty" repetition works as intentional echo.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and strong imagery. Minor issues include occasional elevated register ("bruised twilight," "memory-tide") and some redundancy around the skepticism theme. The final paragraph contains slight template phrasing ("ceased to be...She was") but momentum carries through.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Some redundancy in describing the fragment's properties across multiple beats. Minor template cadence in "He'd [verb]" constructions mid-story, though the closing sequence shows excellent control.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from overwriting - "deathly vitality," "hushed intimacy," "electric pulse syncing with clock's tick" accumulate without advancing the story. Multiple instances of abstract telling ("equilibrium existed in every exchange," "tangible fairness") replace concrete dramatization. The line "the ink's viscosity defying gravity" exemplifies unnecessary purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments like "vibrated in her molars" and "cherry blossoms from a spring in Kyoto, 1862." However, abstract phrases accumulate: "profound, aching connection," "gathering the scattered textures of existence," "stationer of moments." Template structure in final paragraph ("She touched... and prepared... The silence... but on the mountaintop") creates predictable cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied rhythm, but several abstract constructions dilute immediacy ("texture of memories," "hollow ache of the death certificate error"). Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "Elias [verb]" constructions. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments like "ephemeral compass...pointed to moments, fleeting as starlight on water" but suffers from density issues. Multiple metaphors pile up (shell as compass, relic, mockery) creating occasional muddle. Some paraphrase loops around the riddle concept. Template cadence in "He pressed...closed his eyes...drew the bow" sequence. Information density is generally good but figurative language occasionally overwhelms clarity in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some metaphors feel slightly overwrought ("Hope warred with desperation in his chest, a constant, uneasy hum"). Minor template cadence in middle section with repetitive "They would..." constructions. Information density is high and serves the story.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("dawning hush" appears 6 times, "purposefully curious" twice identically) and some purple patches ("moon hung heavy," "gradient of sorrow"). The Chinese character is a clear error. However, momentum generally holds and key moments achieve clarity, with the chemical timer sequence particularly well-rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity ("ozone, warm metal, and damp wool"). Some density issues in middle paragraphs with stacked modifiers ("slow, painstaking work, requiring absolute stillness"). The water refraction explanation borders on over-technical but serves the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant repetition issues plague the prose: "worrying tranquility" appears three times, "dry wit/dry-witted" four times, "singular convergence" twice. Template cadence runs ("She'd...", "She'd...", "She'd...") and paraphrase loops (multiple restatements of the discovery) diminish momentum. The prose lacks the concision needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation, though some figurative density in early paragraphs ("bruised twilight sky," "skeletal remains," "grim portrait") clusters without full payoff. Template cadence appears briefly: "Miners had stamped... merchants hurried... children no longer skipped." Information density is high, with most sentences advancing both atmosphere and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but "lonesome splendor" appears four times creating repetitive phrasing. Some overwriting in mystical passages ("luminous calm," "sacred beauty"). Strong opening and closing lines, though middle sections occasionally drift into abstract territory.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("tangled in the reef's teeth") but suffers from overwriting in places. The hovering sequence contains unclear mechanics ("threaded the labyrinth of the prison's lower corridors") and abstract phrasing. Some repetitive structures appear ("He didn't walk; he began to hover" / "He didn't jump; the light released him"). Information density is uneven.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery: "Light exploded from the roots, racing up the branches in liquid gold." Some figurative density in emotional beats ("heart aching," "tears freezing on his cheeks") and occasional abstract phrasing ("centuries of sorrow"). The final paragraph has slight redundancy between "mournful elation" appearing twice. Information density is high but could tighten emotional summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and purposeful rhythm. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("hauntingly optimistic pull," "reverence, long buried under grief") and some repetitive constructions around the path/weaving metaphor create minor drag. The "orchid solace" phrase appears twice identically. Information density is high but could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("sandals sinking into the loam"). Some overwrought phrases dilute impact ("cautious enchantment," "promise whispered on the wind"). Minor template cadence in middle section ("She spent days...She learned..."). Information density high in opening and closing thirds.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong momentum and sensory density, with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive phrasing ("golden arcade," "golden light," "golden haze"), some abstract register drift ("surveillance-saturated metropolis"), and occasional overwriting ("chrome-and-neon world"). The prose serves the accumulative design but has noticeable texture loops.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose shows strong sensory detail and varied syntax, though some phrases edge toward overwriting ("labyrinth of adjacent possibilities"). Minor redundancy in describing Elara's foolish act multiple times without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variations and high information density. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("fierce tenderness" appears twice) and some filter-verb clustering ("She watched, breath held"). The long sentences effectively mirror the labyrinth's complexity but occasionally risk clarity. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, but several issues: "shrewdly innocent" appears twice identically; some abstract phrasing ("collective fear seeped into his bones"); occasional overwriting in metaphorical density. The "lotus-hearted ache" construction feels forced. Information density is good but uneven.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("watercolors in the rain," "light pierced the mist") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around the knowledge network concept and occasional overwriting in emotional beats. Template cadence appears in the discovery sequence ("She recalled...She remembered...She'd abandoned"), and abstract descriptors like "fragile, luminous" could be more concrete. The paraphrase loop about joy being lost then found appears three times with minimal variation.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some phrases edge toward overwriting ("luminous threads," "vivid mural restorer"). Minor template cadence in the awakening sequence ("The first awakening... Then the second...") but it creates intentional rhythm. Information density is high without becoming cluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between technical explanation and action. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor redundancies appear ("candidly cryptic" used twice, "converging chaos" repeated) and some metaphor mixing ("spark dies" vs "geometry of resistance"), but line-level craft supports the story's conceptual ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with most lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("gargantuan," "pearlescent," "labyrinthine" cluster densely). Some metaphors strain credibility ("blood-orange moon clawed"), and there's minor repetition of "shyly unstoppable" without sufficient variation, but overall momentum and clarity remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm that mirrors the story's musical theme. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for minor repetition ("deserted marvels" appears twice, "foxglove regret" three times) and slight overwriting in figurative language density during quieter moments.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("dust motes suspended in the lamplight like frozen constellations") but suffers from repetitive structure in the vow sequences and some overwriting ("carefully reckless" appears twice, abstract phrases like "symphonies of truth"). Template cadence in middle translation sequences ("She began...She moved...She worked") reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several instances of overwriting dilute momentum: "slyly heartfelt audacity," "fragile, necessary peace," and abstract phrases like "harmonized conflicting values." Template cadence appears in "Aris understood...Aris's breath hitched...Aris placed" sequence, and some metaphors strain ("surveyor's chain...felt like a lifeline to Elara's intent").

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Several instances of overwriting: "slow ballet of dust motes," "paper trails" appearing three times, some template cadence in middle section ("She'd discovered...She needed...Her method was"). Information density is good but some paraphrase loops around the trust theme reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, though some figurative language feels forced ("featherly determined" appears twice without clear meaning). The prose maintains momentum despite occasional overwriting ("The fractured hush settled over the drifting prism terrace like powdered glass"). Template cadence appears in middle sections ("She recalled...," "She saw...," "She breathed...") but doesn't pervade the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose density high with multi-layered sentences carrying action, atmosphere, and emotion simultaneously. Some overwriting in figurative density ("liquid maps," "ghostly spectrums," "liquid stars" in close proximity) and occasional template cadence ("She felt... She saw... She remembered"). The closing image achieves strong propulsion through rhythm acceleration.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("seeds scattered like fallen stars") but suffers from repetitive constructions—three consecutive "She [verb]" openings mid-story. Information density is uneven, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others merely describe without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax and strong momentum. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some mild overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("star-dusted quiet," "scattered diamonds") and occasional template phrasing ("head tilted," "hands stilling") but nothing that obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "knelt in the twilight garden under stars, her bare feet pressing into cool soil still holding the day's warmth" establishes setting, time, and sensory grounding simultaneously. Some figurative density in places ("spontaneously anchored, rooted to the spot by an invisible force") but it serves the transformative moment. Minor synonym churn around "gaps/voids/spaces."

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information-dense prose like "concentric rings erupted, flawless circles expanding across the pond's dark mirror" advances multiple layers simultaneously. Some overwriting appears in passages like "vast, intricate network of cause and effect, beauty born from tension and repair," creating mild density issues, and "noctilucent reckonings" reads as thesaurus-inflated for this POV.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery, but several instances of abstract telling weaken momentum: "different understanding emerged," "Enlightenment didn't arrive as a shout." The phrase "Hard softness filled him" feels forced. Some redundancy in the middle section about transforming pain into universal language.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "salt-crystals on the stone, arranging them into fractal patterns with decorations of crushed abalone shells." However, paraphrase loops appear ("Hope wasn't a fixed point but a dynamic system—revitalized through connection, measured in shared breaths"), and some metaphors edge toward purple ("cathedral of possibility"). Template cadence emerges in the Timeline A/B/C repetitions, though this serves the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean prose with vivid specific details ("brass resonator," "water-swollen leather"). Information density is moderate with some purposeful description. Deductions for template cadence runs ("He knelt...He carefully pried...He saw"), paraphrase loops around the "legacy's burden" concept, and elevated register that occasionally breaks POV lexicon ("spiritual fracture," "collective memory").

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some abstract phrasing ("fragile intersection of light, moisture, and belief") and occasional elevated register ("dusky harmony") create minor friction. No significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Several overwrought metaphors ("ghosts of countless failed talks," "bloomed into fire") and template phrases ("weight familiar in her hands," "ash in her mouth") accumulate without touching closure directly. The prose maintains momentum but lacks the crystalline precision required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied syntax and selective detail, though some figurative density ("fractured grace incarnate—beauty born of utter ruin") edges toward overwriting. Information density is generally high, with most sentences advancing multiple layers, but occasional redundancies appear ("silent plea" after establishing the egg won't hatch).

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"snow whispering against her untouched skirts" establishes setting, character, and tone simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak beats ("living sonnet written in motion") approaches overwriting but stays pattern-consistent. Deduction for template cadence in the resolution sequence ("She had not sung...," "As dawn tinged...," "No lullaby would...") and slight abstraction in "raw, beautiful chaos."

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dense, atmospheric prose with strong moments but several issues: redundant phrasing ("thick, waiting quality" followed by "waiting to be grasped"), abstract constructions ("the urgency of this moment"), and overwritten passages that slow momentum. The modifier density in descriptive beats ("fragile, exposed nerve") accumulates without always advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variation, but several issues dampen momentum: redundant phrases like "silent, desperate journey" and "fragile, overlooked details," plus some overwriting in passages like "sanctuary carved from living jade and mist." The extended final sentence about the grotto feeling "both infinitely vast and intimately close" edges toward purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good information density, though some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("aurora light bleeding through frozen vaults like liquid emerald"). Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "She [verb]" constructions. Some elevated diction ("snowmelt ardor") risks register drift but serves the lyrical tone. The technical descriptions of rope-work and casting are precise without becoming mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("brittle parchment, ink fading like forgotten promises"). However, abstract phrasing accumulates ("ethereal pull," "raw present," "silent songs") and some redundancy appears ("decaying directive" repeated, "precisely playful" echoed). The final paragraph contains multiple abstraction loops that dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("stones settling like bones between empires") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most high-pressure sentences without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in the alignment sequence ("He placed...He lit...He aligned"). The phrase "empirically ironic" appears twice verbatim, creating unnecessary repetition that dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("walls shimmered like heat haze," "exhaled...like smoke from a room") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "cellular memory" (5 instances) and some abstract constructions ("grace could manifest"). Template cadence appears in exposition ("She believed...," "She'd chosen...," "She'd schemed..."). Information density generally good with multi-purpose sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty - "the world transforming into a landscape of frozen glass mountains" - but suffers from occasional redundancy ("cold, dew-slicked," "thick fog clung") and some overwritten metaphors. The breathing sequence maintains strong momentum through varied rhythm, though "firmly grounded" appears twice without clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variation and strong verbs ("breached," "snaking," "snatched"). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor repetition in emotional labeling ("tears pricked," "voice trembling") and some abstract phrasing ("accidental wisdom sparked") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some ornamental phrases ("frozen stars," "velvet void") and repetitive structures appear. The philosophical breakthrough paragraph contains slight paraphrase loops around the inheritance concept. Information density is moderate; most sentences advance the story but some descriptive passages could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("dust motes danced in the single shaft of light") but suffers from abstract phrasing like "temporal weave" and "reality's fabric" that dulls immediacy. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Information density varies—some sentences do multiple jobs while others merely restate ("ensure the library's survival" follows the rescue itself).

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but overwriting appears in peak beats: "shimmering wall of woven light and sorrow" and "verdant path" feel elevated beyond the established register. Template cadence appears in "She pressed...She focused...She moved" construction. The extended single-paragraph structure creates visual monotony despite strong individual sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good information density, though some elevated diction ("ceremonial rope...coiled like a sleeping serpent"). Template phrases appear ("carefully, she unpicked," "finally, she took"). The "wound into a lesson" formulation in the closure paragraph tends toward abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments but suffers from density issues - multiple compound sentences with similar structures, particularly in the opening third. Some figurative language feels overwrought ("frozen lightning," "visible wave of absolute silence"). The filter verb "She saw it" and repetitive "She [verb]" patterns dull immediacy in key discovery moments.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. However, several ornate constructions slow momentum ("bled through," "guttered out," "cutting paths"). Minor template patterns in vision descriptions ("she'd seen," "she'd glimpsed"). The final paragraph maintains propulsion through to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (setting/character/atmosphere). Some elevated diction approaches purple prose ("bruised sky," "suffocating blanket") but remains controlled. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "she [verb]" constructions. The closing image effectively recharges earlier motifs without loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "iron gates...boots crunching on crushed petal pathways." Some abstract phrasing ("gravity of hopelessness pulled at her bones") and repetitive constructions around the chant reduce momentum. The final image of ember as "small, warm heart" lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information-dense prose with strong moments ("stars so sharp they seemed carved from ice"). However, abstract philosophical passages about time contain some paraphrase loops ("Time wasn't a river... but this: a slow gathering"). Filter verb clusters in meditation sequence ("she realized," "she felt," "she understood") dull immediacy in places.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty but suffers from density overload—nearly every sentence contains figurative language. Mixed metaphors appear ("silence sprouted—not as sound"), and phrases like "contracted with purpose" and "intangibly tangible" create opacity that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong information density with most sentences doing multiple jobs. However, several metaphoric constructions feel strained ("silence must breathe to comfort"), and there's occasional template cadence ("He'd studied...He'd carry..."). The "fluidly logical" repetition works as pattern but borders on excessive. Line-level craft is competent but occasionally purple.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. However, several instances of overwriting: "futuristic nostalgia that haunted her every expedition," redundant descriptions, and some template cadence in the final paragraph ("She emerged... She walked... She touched... She stepped"). Information density is high but occasionally tips into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("silence here wasn't peaceful; it was a loaded emptiness") but suffers from repetitive stems and occasional overwriting. The phrase "burned bridges carefully" appears verbatim twice, "ashen charcoal sanctuary" repeats exactly, and some metaphors strain ("Starlight bled"). Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others loop concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from density issues with figurative language in nearly every sentence. Template cadence appears in "She recognized... She watched... She felt..." sequence. The phrase "virtuously mischievous" repeats verbatim. Some overwriting ("tectonic plates," "siren song," "poisoned lure") clutters high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong prose control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor deductions for the explanation-heavy paragraph about Silas's motivations and slight overuse of "golden shadows" (appears 4 times).

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong momentum. Some elevated diction ("factually mystical weight," "resonant reconfiguration") occasionally strains the register. Minor redundancy in describing the greenhouse's mystical qualities. The "shivering bliss" moment lands effectively despite borderline purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several instances of elevated diction strain against the intimate POV ("monument to loss," "vessel for untold stories"), and some paraphrase loops appear ("dust motes no longer just debris but a record of absence"). The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but occasional overwriting and template phrases ("racing thoughts," "trembling hands") accumulate.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong momentum with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm shifts between action and reflection. Information density is high - most sentences advance plot, character, or atmosphere. However, some abstract phrasing ("tyranny of indifference," "revised histories") and occasional telling ("carefully resourceful") create minor opacity that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths that support the story's cadence, particularly in the climactic performance sequence. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though some descriptive passages lean toward the ornamental ("spectral shards," "eerie nostalgia") without full payoff, and the opening contains slight redundancy in establishing the mist.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose density high with lines doing multiple jobs: "sorted seeds beneath the ashen skyborne arbor" establishes action, setting, and atmosphere simultaneously. Strong specificity in "ghost-white poppy, ironwood, sky-orchid." Minor template cadence in monument-building sequence ("a cairn...for," "a spiral...for") and slight overwriting in "pure and cold as moonlight."

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but "uncertainly certain" appears twice verbatim, and there's scaffold around "Aris felt uncertainly certain" that could be cut. The line "vibrating faintly, as if resonating with the waterfall's pulse" shows strong sensory precision. Some abstract patches ("befriend uncertainty in planning") need grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dense, imagistic prose with strong propulsion but overwriting issues: "factually mystical" appears twice, some metaphors strain ("heavy as lead yet fragile as glass"), and register occasionally inflates beyond necessity. Template structures emerge in the failed/successful repair sequence ("Again he heated..."), though the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong sensory specificity. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("modestly fearless resolve," "desperate, silent agony") and some template phrasing around the spirit's description. The "luminous ache" repetition works as intentional framing.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with vivid sensory detail and varied syntax. Deductions for repetitive phrasing ("ultraviolet" appears 8 times, "proprioception/proprioceptively" 6 times) and some abstract constructions ("desperate hope," "brutal mathematics," "fragile equilibrium"). The filter verb "remembered" appears multiple times but serves the trauma-response method.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("fractured glass both elusively tangible and heavy with memory") but suffers from density issues. Multiple abstract concepts stack without breathing room, and some sentences attempt too many simultaneous jobs. Template cadence appears in the painting examination sequence ("She raised... she held... she angled").

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks, though several metaphorical reaches strain ("holding smoke," "thin places where past bled into present"). Template constructions appear in the ghost interaction sequence ("Thorn's ghost drifted," "Thorn's story unfolded," "Thorn's ghost smiled") creating cadence monotony that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves strong imagery and rhythm but contains scattered redundancies ("rustling awakenings" appears three times with similar function). Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs, though phrases like "destabilizing perfect systems" and variations repeat without added pressure. The final paragraph's new constellations image provides effective closure without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some ornate constructions slow momentum ("a slow, amber river now flowing through the baroque asteroid's crumbling corridors"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deduction for repeated "burnished sorrow" phrase and occasional overwriting in descriptive passages that don't directly serve the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Dust motes danced in the single shaft of weak afternoon light piercing the high vault, illuminating wilting starlight lilies." Some abstract phrasing ("the lie thick in the air") and occasional overwriting ("oppressive shroud of midnight *ripped*") create minor friction.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("obsidian mirror ringed by stalactites"). Some overwriting in figurative density during peak moments ("dark silk," "coiled spring," "liquid shadow" clustered). Template cadence appears briefly ("She saw...She'd come...She dipped"). Information density high but occasionally strains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is uneven with some paraphrase loops ("reimagine" appears 7 times, often restating similar concepts). Strong opening and closing lines anchor the piece, but middle sections contain scaffold phrases like "Mara understood" and "She realized" that could be cut for greater propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and strong moments ("darkness holds the gentlest light"). Some overwriting appears in figurative density ("velvet glove," "scattered stars") and occasional template phrases ("breath caught"). The final paragraph contains slight redundancy about understanding that could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some overwriting appears ("the world tilting violently," "fragmented scenes flooded him"). Minor template cadence in the retrocognitive vision sequences. The filter verb "felt" appears multiple times. Information density is good but could be tighter in places.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong opening with "deserted alchemist" creating immediate intrigue and varied sentence structures throughout. Minor template cadence in the civilization-building sequence ("First, the streets... Then, the people...") and occasional abstract phrasing ("vastness in a single mind") that could be more concrete, but prose generally maintains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("wax cylinder phonograph shaving no larger than a fingernail"). Some density issues with stacked modifiers ("ancient orchard garden," "venerable oath scribe") and occasional purple moments ("suffocating embrace"). The apocalyptic register occasionally overwhelms clarity in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Information density is high throughout. However, some ornamental language approaches overwriting ("indifferent starlight," "cathedral of frozen silence") and occasional register elevation ("vortex inheritance pulsing like a captured star") that doesn't fully match the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several repetitive structures weaken impact. "After the glue dried" appears twice identically, multiple "she [verb]" constructions create template cadence, and some paraphrase loops ("silence so complete"/"deepen rather than shatter the stillness"). The phrase "credibly curious" feels forced both times.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("star-dust glittered on his knuckles like captured constellations") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing ("terrifying freedom of dissolution," "flourishing stillness"). Some sentences could be tightened, and metaphysical abstractions occasionally slow momentum, though no major loops or scaffolding appear.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves strong imagery ("ghosts avoided the last standing apiary shed," "cobalt and amber shards") with varied rhythm. However, template repetition appears ("contextual clues" 3x, "tangled covenant" 3x) and some paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("preserve the weight meant honoring what could never be said aloud" restates the prior beat). The "mute eloquence" and similar abstractions create register drift in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline specificity—"ash whispering from its jagged lip"—but suffers from register drift into academic abstraction ("deliberate trail," "residual energy") and occasional template phrasing ("heart pounding with anticipated mysteries"). The filter-verb stack in the Miller's sale sequence ("spotted," "handed," "lay") dulls immediacy during a discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose occasionally strains with elevated diction ("cobalt lagoon," "burnished hush") appearing frequently. Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "completion was a myth, but connection was real" followed immediately by similar restatements. The phrase "woven dawns" gets excessive repetition without evolving meaning. Filter verbs like "she sensed" and "felt" accumulate in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Copper wire, thin and pliable, coiled in his palm like a promise"). Rhythm varies effectively between longer observations and short declarations ("They listen"). Minor repetition of "brazen calm" and some filter verbs ("felt," "felt") create slight drag but don't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose density high with purposeful scientific terminology, though "bronze quiet" repetition and some overwritten moments ("weathered stone sculptures lining the route—abstract forms meant to represent 'cosmic unity'") slow momentum. Template cadence appears in middle section with repeated "She [verb]" constructions. Strong final line recharges the opening's promise.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like "knuckles white on the rail" and the concrete bird interactions, but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Elias [verb]" appears frequently) and some overwritten passages. The phrase "narrow vastness" recurs without sufficient reweighting, and abstract formulations like "silence becomes a physical thing" could be more embodied. Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs, though some philosophical passages slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments like "twisted metal bones against the bruised twilight sky" and the tactile cylinder discovery show careful craft. However, "wild hush" appears four times with diminishing returns, and phrases like "intuitively descriptive" feel workshopped rather than organic. The final paragraph maintains momentum despite some repetitive structures ("He wouldn't... At dawn, he'd... The wasteland's...").

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from significant overwriting with mixed metaphors ("dust motes...frozen stars," "sky bled with slow-motion constellations") and repetitive abstract phrases about time. The paraphrase loop "This deck was her sanctuary, the compass rose her compass, and the custom her compass" particularly damages momentum, alongside multiple instances of telling what has been shown.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments of compression and rhythm but suffers from conceptual redundancy—"sacred play" and "cautious abandon" repeat without added pressure. Template structures appear ("He'd learned...who'd said" pattern). The acorn detail and fox Knight carving add textural specificity, but some figurative language feels forced ("dancing with chaos" metaphor extended without deepening).

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves strong moments like "spelling words into dust" and the tactile unbinding sequence. However, several abstract phrases ("benevolently ruthless focus," "luminous absence") and some repetitive constructions ("She walked," "She wrote") create minor drag. The paraphrase loop around trauma being "real" versus "performance" costs additional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple layers. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("hallowed mountain," "mercury-glass seer") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete. The "hidden thunder" metaphor works but approaches purple prose territory.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("fidgeted productively," "fierce repose"), but synonym loops appear ("frayed threads"/"frayed strand," multiple "winnow" uses). Template cadence in "She recalled...Yet here...The frayed threads confirmed it" sequence dulls momentum without taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with effective rhythm variation, but several instances of overwriting ("forged hush pressing down," "labyrinth of silence that felt heavy and ancient") and abstract phrasing ("fragile balance holding back the abyss") dilute immediacy. The filter-verb stack in emotional beats ("Kael saw," "remembering," "refused to yield") reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm during action sequences. Information density is generally high. Deductions for abstract formulations ("conjure meaning from the edge of that very oblivion"), some redundancy ("the hungry sea eating the hull, molecule by molecule" could be tighter), and the explanatory realization paragraph that paraphrases the dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. However, abstract phrases like "temporary eternity" appear multiple times, and there's some emotional summary ("grief softened into something bearable, almost sacred") that could be more embodied. The "intimately aloof" construction feels forced. Some synonym churn around memory/ghost concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the deep exhale of the world returning to itself"), but some overwriting appears in peak beats ("fierce, almost violent love that demanded silence"). Minor repetition of "whisper" concept and occasional elevated diction ("tyranny," "herald") that slightly strains the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("hands cobbled from mismatched skin grafts and polished brass"). Information density is good, most sentences do multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("starlight so sharp it felt like shards of glass") and abstract metaphors that slow momentum. Some template cadence in the middle section's building sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose density serves the accumulative design but creates momentum drag in places—"neural-regenerative properties...gleaned from crumbling medical texts long dismissed as quackery" could be tighter. Several sentences attempt too many jobs simultaneously. The strongest passages integrate action with reflection, as when Elara places the glass eye and experiences immediate sensory change.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is solid. However, several instances of overwriting ("borrowed ache for mountains he'd never see"), template phrasing ("Silas understood"), and abstract descriptors ("quiet dignity") accumulate. The phrase "eccentric keeper of borrowed light" feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structures. Information density is high, particularly in the cavern descriptions. Deductions for some redundancy ("dwindled like ink on forgotten parchment" followed by similar metaphors) and occasional overwriting in figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery like "falling stars weeping liquid light" and strong rhythmic control. Some overwriting in passages like "velvet darkness laced with crystalline poison" and "the lacy menace of the place deepened." Information density is high but occasional metaphor stacking ("bleeding starlight," "crystalline poison," "lacy menace") creates minor congestion.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("pocket-suns could freeze light, but could they trap this raw, fleeting essence?"). However, abstract phrases like "density of presence" and "palette of resolve" appear repeatedly without sufficient grounding. Some redundancy in explaining Elara's realization reduces momentum in the transformation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("feral nostalgia clawed at her"). Information density is high, particularly in dream sequences. Some overwriting in metaphorical sections ("temporal poison," "bleeding timelines") and occasional abstract phrasing ("chronologically confused fracture"). The final paragraph achieves good momentum despite density.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with evocative moments ("cathedral of time and unspoken healing"). Several instances of telling rather than showing ("reading between the lines of his clipped answers") and some abstract phrasing ("emotional terrain") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments of precision but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "saturated hush" (3 uses) and template structures ("He wrote of...", "the rune for..."). Several sentences restate similar content without added pressure. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, but others merely elaborate. The filter-verb stack in emotional beats ("remembered," "began to," "seemed to") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong figurative language ("silence thick as unplayed sheet music," "gossip was the city's heartbeat... silence is the arrhythmia") serves thematic purpose. Information density high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in middle section and some paraphrase loops around the imperfect miracle concept that don't add new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("moonlight bled through a fissure") and maintains consistent atmosphere. However, abstract scaffolding appears in phrases like "the agony of seeing history's end and knowing its illusions persisted" and conceptual redundancy in "unify the opposing forces: creation and entropy, memory and oblivion." The climactic transformation relies on telling ("silent explosion") rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with the countdown structure doing multiple jobs. However, repetitive phrasing appears ("razor edge" used 8 times, "eminently peculiar" 3 times) and some abstract constructions blur clarity ("the tension between now and now"). The "squint" repetition (4 instances) creates unnecessary echo. Strong opening and closing lines partially compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.6)
    Repetitive phrasing pervades: "quiet wildfire" appears 4 times, "permeable barriers" 3 times, "physics of letting go" 3 times. Template cadence dominates the ending ("She [verb]" structure repeats across 8+ sentences). The final third consists of summary statements ("Revolution was internal as much as external") that explain rather than dramatize.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density is solid. Deductions for repetitive use of "lucid contradiction" (4 times), some abstract phrasing ("widening perspectives responsibly"), and occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Each call was a fragile bridge across loneliness, yet he never let them touch solid ground"). Some abstract phrasing appears ("melodically haunted," "cultivated estrangement") but serves the lyric mode. Minor repetition of "hum" and "loop" concepts, though these create pattern rather than redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("walnut ink staining her fingertips like earth-born constellations") but suffers from abstract terminology loops ("proximate causes" appears 4 times, "regenerated covenant" 3 times) and occasional overwriting in figurative density. Information density is high but clarity occasionally obscured by elevated diction. Template cadence in some descriptive passages ("She carried... She reached... She opened...").

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several template constructions ("He patted...He traced...He pulled...He saw"). Some overwriting in figurative language ("fragile as dandelion fluff") and abstract phrasing ("the impossible equation of human connection"). Information density is moderate—some passages could do more work.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong sensory specificity and varied syntax, but several instances of elevated diction drift ("ceased to exist in conflict," "eternal shift") and filter constructions ("She understood now," "She focused on"). The "fierce, tender core" phrase and some abstract formulations in the final paragraph reduce immediacy. Information density remains high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("warping starlight into impossible spirals") but suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around "contingent relationships" and "threshing meaning." Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly "She didn't know if history had changed—perhaps the botanist would still choose wrong" followed by near-identical uncertainty, and template cadence emerges in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation matching scene pressure. Information density high—most sentences advance both external action and internal state. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("liquid pearl," "crystalline tone") and slight template cadence in the middle mapping sequence ("She positioned...Raising...she began").

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose clarity generally serves the story, but repetitive phrasing appears throughout ("She traced," "She took," "She worked"), creating template cadence. Information density suffers from paraphrase loops like "The forgotten promise was no longer forgotten; it was entrusted to her" and the final two lines essentially restate the same point.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong information density and purposeful rhythm, though figurative language occasionally overwhelms ("silver serpents," "dying stars," "auroral sorrow"). Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("the hush of the universe inhaling"), and there's mild redundancy in explaining the drumming's purpose. The final sentence achieves powerful propulsion through its triple structure ("the universe exhaled, and Elara...was alone again").

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong momentum, but figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("metal skins vibrating like colossal tuning forks," "creases sharp as knife cuts," "cold, heavy zodiac coin"). The "calculated spontaneity" phrase feels forced rather than organic to voice.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with good information density, but several instances of overwriting diminish momentum: "spiralingly calm" repetition, some abstract phrasing like "the quiet insistence of light persisting." The extended single-paragraph format works for the accumulative mode but occasionally creates density fatigue. Strong closing image partially redeems these issues.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("mist like ink in water"). Template cadence appears in middle section ("They spoke...They'd spent weeks") and some paraphrase loops around the rebellion concept. Information density high in opening and closing but sags slightly in the grotto planning scene.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is moderate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. Template cadence appears in transformation sequence ("She was...," "She could...," "She took...") and some paraphrase loops ("calling her home"/"urging her to let go"). Mixed metaphor of "wings stretching" for a sea creature. Clear propulsion in final third despite these artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves purposeful rhythm variation and strong sensory detail ("shavings curling like pale smoke"). Some repetitive structures ("She began," "She felt," "She spoke") create minor drag. The "light and unburdened" ending lands effectively but "remade hush" appears three times without sufficient evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, but suffers from repetitive conceptual phrasing around "dissolving boundaries" (appears 5+ times) and occasional overwriting in figurative density. The phrase "paraphrase" and its variants create mild synonym churn, and abstract declarations sometimes replace concrete imagery in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("concertina reed tongue across the glassblower's discarded cobalt shard"). Several instances of elevated diction ("currency of bartered awakenings," "eloquence") and abstract phrasing ("moments of sudden clarity traded like seeds") create register drift. Opening sentence overpacked.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "dust danced in the golden shadows, vibrating at 137.5 Hz." However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("texture of connection," "artificial pilgrimage") and some redundancy in describing the bell's resonance effects. The phrase "powerfully gentle" appears three times with minimal variation. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "She [verb]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose generally flows well with varied syntax, but several issues accumulate: the unexplained Chinese character "顽强," some abstract phrasing ("cosmic indifference," "wellspring of hope"), and occasional overwriting in the figurative language ("spark, fragile as moth wings"). The sentence beginning "Below, the city lights..." needs grammatical cleanup. Information density is strong in action sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose generally clean with strong moments ("Rain tapped a hesitant rhythm," "onyx-ink cartomancy cards"). Information density high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or concept. Some register elevation in peak moments ("the invisible stresses within the community's soul") and occasional filter-verb clusters ("She began to confide," "she realized") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dense, purposeful prose with strong imagery. However, several abstract concept loops ("atoms of nostalgia" repeated, "end of innocence" used multiple times) and some overwritten passages ("geometric marvel of interlocking bronze tiers") reduce momentum. The "atoms of nostalgia" concept borders on template language.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Deductions for density issues - multiple metaphors cluster in single sentences ("library's drifting edge," "spectral parchment," "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" in opener). Some abstract phrasing ("geometry of hope," "sentient void") reduces clarity in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure. Several instances of abstract phrasing ("fragile convictions," "profound, quiet stillness") and some filter constructions ("She remembered," "She observed"). The metaphor "shedding layers" works but becomes slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts. Some overwriting appears ("celestial shower," "maritime grandfather") and the phrase "displaced miracle" repeats without evolution, creating mild density issues without compromising clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose shows good variation in sentence structure and paragraph length. Information density is generally strong, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("unused love" appears 11 times). Lines like "corridors lined with shelves, each holding a glowing orb of unused love, pulsing like a heartbeat" and "living geometry of longing" edge toward purple prose without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"the moon watched, its silver light finally unchallenged"—with varied sentence structures supporting rhythm. However, several abstract phrases dilute immediacy: "essence of her ancestors' visions," "profound melancholy of witnessing," "sacred act of tracing." Some figurative density in non-peak moments ("moonstruck dreamer, eyes perpetually reflecting") without clear pattern-teaching, though clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and effective imagery, though some metaphorical density ("bruised twilight sky," "hollow echoes of songs") occasionally slows the pace. Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions, but phrases like "hope meticulously recorded" and "pixel by fragile pixel" show mild overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though some paraphrase loops appear ("The forest itself was a symphony of contradictions" followed by listing contradictions). Template cadence emerges in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple sentences. The final paragraph maintains momentum despite length, with vivid concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose flows with intentional rhythm but suffers from repetitive constructions ("She realized...She understood...She knew"). The phrase "unused courage" appears five times without sufficient variation. Some metaphors strain ("heart beat a shoreline lullaby"). Information density is moderate; several passages could compress without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("light from a high window caught the slightest discoloration") but suffers from paraphrase loops ("safety required surrender, the silencing of joy to preserve flesh" restates the same concept). Template cadence appears in repeated "She [verb]" constructions, and abstract philosophizing ("terrible arithmetic") dulls momentum in places.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Deductions for repetitive constructions ("Aris knelt," "Aris remained," "Aris returned," "Aris placed") and some purple moments ("empire of lies reduced to dust motes in moonlight"). The "witness" moment lands effectively despite surrounding flourishes.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose shows strong moments ("the ocean's memory remained poisoned") but suffers from occasional overwriting and one paraphrase loop around the tapping rhythm. The phrase "periodically eternal" strains when repeated, and some sentences could compress without losing power.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and controlled rhythm, but several issues accumulate: repetitive "hum" variations (8+ instances), some purple patches ("bruised purples and hesitant golds" paired with "thunderous serenity"), and occasional register drift into academic territory ("resonant reconfiguration"). The paraphrase loop about serenity/emptiness ("Serenity wasn't emptiness; it was the space where meaning could grow") dulls momentum. Information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose generally propels with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good—most lines advance multiple story elements. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "implanted destiny" and "insurgent," some template cadence in middle sections ("She must... She poured... She carefully"), and occasional abstract flourishes that don't serve the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generally strong prose with vivid sensory work, but some redundancy ("trembling hand"/"forced her trembling hand") and filter verb stacking in the somatic sequence. The "penance and purpose" alliteration feels slightly forced. Information density high in descriptive passages but occasionally loops in the internal sections.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though occasional overwriting: "luminescent ache that mirrored her own hollowed-out heart" edges toward purple. Some template cadence in the thread-untangling sequence ("One thread...another..."). Information density is high and the final image lands with power, but figurative density in peak beats ("river of light pouring over the churning sea") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of abstract emotional labeling and metaphor density that slow key beats. "Serene anger" appears four times with minimal variation. Some template phrasing in the middle section ("She recalled... She concentrated... She willed"). The scientific/poetic register clash occasionally muddles clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clean but suffers from repetitive structures ("She moved," "She climbed," "She emerged") and some clichéd phrasing ("clutched her throat," "hammering against her ribs"). Several paraphrase loops appear ("silence was a physical presence" / "Silence rushed back, heavier than before"). Information density could be higher in transition passages.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("soft *snick* of steel on leather louder than any shout"). However, several overwritten phrases burden momentum: "skeletal remains...clawed," "fragile bubble of life," "swirling dust as silently as they'd come." The extended metaphorical language occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong momentum with vivid sensory work, but several overwrought constructions slow key beats ("the goddess's echo—if it existed—would surface here"). The repetition of "transliterates emotions" without variation suggests scaffold. Some mixed metaphors strain coherence (stars as both sleepwalkers and drunkards). Information density is high but occasionally tips into purple prose during action sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose density serves story with lines doing multiple jobs ("velvet sky glittered with stars that seemed to pulse in orbits of regret"). Some figurative density in early paragraphs ("echoing observatory," "satellite trapped," "tightening like a noose") without full payoff. Clean syntax and varied rhythm support momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and purposeful compression. Several instances of elevated register drift ("profound silence," "eerie stillness thick and absolute") and some abstract phrasing ("moment sound became mercy"). Information density is good but occasional redundancy appears ("thick and absolute," "swallowed by the storm/storm"). No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong compression like "This was the time of unlearning," but suffers from repetitive "emergent hush" (4x), "lilac unease" (3x), and abstract phrasing like "quiet triumph of connection." Template cadence appears in final third with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" structures.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "tessera trembling in his grasp" and effective variation in sentence length. However, several overwrought phrases accumulate: "paradox of warm coldness," "jagged mosaic of cloud and ruin," and repetitive "shattered sky" imagery. Some scaffold phrases like "he understood now" and "driven by the vision" could be cut for momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("roses bloomed with petals like captured starlight"), but several abstract phrases weaken momentum ("lure possibility from the brink of despair," "intertwine the timelines"). The synesthetic descriptions work effectively, though some scaffolding appears in transitions ("Following it," "Closing her eyes").

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the opening. Some overwriting in figurative language ("dust motes danced," "ghostly trails," "prismatic shards") clusters without clear pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears briefly ("He closed his eyes... Lena mirrored him"). The final image lands cleanly despite these minor frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.7)
    Generally clear prose with good momentum through the discovery sequence. Multiple instances of telling rather than showing ("tears blurred her vision as she realized") and repetitive constructions ("She sought to," "She'd carried," "She activated"). The phrase "factually mystical" works as intentional oxymoron but other abstractions like "transitional object" and "emotional continuity" create distance.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. However, several instances of elevated register ("gilding motes that hung in the unearthed silence") and some redundancy in thematic statements reduce momentum. The phrase "unearthed silence" appears twice, and there's unnecessary scaffolding in explaining the prophecy's dual nature.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like "mist clinging to his coat like a second skin" but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "fixing what's broken/shattered" (4+ instances) and some template constructions ("He thought of...He remembered...He keyed"). Information density is good in action sequences but thins during reflective passages. The paraphrase loop about broken things in the middle section dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from overwriting in places—"spindrift serenity itself—fragile, transient, yet utterly present" strains for effect. Some template repetition ("Silas felt," "He watched"). Strong opening and solid rhythm overall, but figurative density in high-pressure moments ("palimpsest promise lived in this act") reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful repetition of "thrum" as a binding element. Information density is high—most sentences advance both external discovery and internal realization. However, abstract phrases like "accumulated weight of kindness" and "phototropic and stubborn" create opacity in peak beats, and "invisible hands" in the penultimate paragraph dulls specificity where concrete imagery would strengthen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("each mirrored piece now a tiny beacon waiting to awaken") but suffers from repetitive phrasing and occasional overwriting. The "quivering hush" appears four times with minimal variation; "wistfully pragmatic" twice; "rhythm of oars in water" three times. Mixed metaphors appear ("constellation of potential light," "sanctuary of reflected moonlight"). Template cadence emerges in places ("She felt...She thought...She traced..."), and some sentences strain for effect rather than clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and strategic paragraph breaks, with strong verbs driving action ("traced," "clutched," "speared"). However, abstract constructions appear in clusters ("brittle awakenings—fragile eruptions of truth," "cocoon woven from the library's solitude") and some paraphrase loops weaken density ("isolation had been her shield"/"isolation was a cage").

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose maintains good momentum with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is generally strong, with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. Some overwriting in figurative language ("stone blossom from the water") and occasional template phrasing ("drawn by the inevitably whimsical sight"). The "vessel for others' emotions" metaphor recurs without sufficient evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("protests churned like a faulty receiver") but several template phrases weaken momentum: "familiar weight," "cautiously hopeful" appears twice verbatim, "spark of ethereal grit." The extended compound sentences in paragraphs 2-3 create density without always advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose shows strong moments ("heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird") but suffers from density issues - multiple complex metaphors cluster in single sentences. Some redundancy appears ("oppressive darkness"/"feeble glow," "trembling hand"/"claustrophobic heart"). The final paragraph contains multiple abstract reflections that could be compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("tears cutting tracks through the dust") but suffers from repetitive "She [verb]" openings across multiple paragraphs. Several paraphrase loops appear ("dormant empathy" stated multiple times without variation). Information density varies, with some passages doing single duty where compression would strengthen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dense, atmospheric prose with strong rhythm in places, but overwriting pervades: "verdigris-coated copper nail," "dissonant counterpoint," multiple metaphors per sentence. The revelation paragraph contains exposition loops ("He'd hammered the nail... a marker for salvage, proof the vessel was deliberately sunk") that restate rather than advance, dulling momentum at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong moments like "the wind carrying the ghost of violin notes" and efficient compression, but suffers from repetitive constructions ("dynamically observant" appears twice identically) and some overwriting in figurative density. The phrase "luminous disbelief" repeats mechanically for tone. Information density is generally high but occasional redundancy ("shattered remnant," "fractured image") and filter constructions weaken momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good information density, though some overwriting appears ("suffocating suffusion of doubt," "dusky harmony"). Minor template cadence in the marking sequence and occasional abstract phrasing ("space where understanding finally took root") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and information density, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("healing began when burdens were distributed"/"healing began when one voice became many"), and abstract formulations like "quiet communion across time" lack the concrete specificity of stronger passages.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose flows with varied sentence lengths and generally strong imagery. Information density is moderate, with most sentences advancing plot or atmosphere. However, several instances of telling undercut showing: "his gift—to find lost things—was his only hope now" could be demonstrated through action alone. Some metaphors strain ("branches snapping like brittle bones in the perpetual gale").

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without always advancing pressure ("dying star," "moth's wing"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("root-bound"/"roots coiled"/"roots slithered"), and "anxious elation" repeats as a label rather than embodied state.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but occasionally tips into overwriting ("the silence where her brother's laughter should be was a wound that festered in the marrow"). Strong syntactic variety and propulsive imagery, though some metaphor vehicles strain coherence ("roots...with quiet hunger").

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "confidently uncertain" which captures both his professional stance and emotional state. Some repetition exists around "echo valley" and "silence/quiet" but functions as pattern-teaching for the accumulative design. Minor scaffold appears in "He wouldn't list it as minimal value. He'd keep it" which could be compressed to single action.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"the beautiful, heartbreaking proximity of knowing"—though occasional density in technical descriptions slows momentum mid-story. Strong information density overall, with most sentences advancing both plot and atmosphere. The closing image elegantly synthesizes the story's threads without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant paraphrase loops pervade the text: "Tomorrow might never return"/"Tomorrow's absence"/"Since Tomorrow vanished" repeat the same concept; "preserving wonder"/"preserve wonder"/"preserving light" churn synonyms. Template cadence appears in "She approached...She dipped...She checked...She placed" structure, and abstract phrasing like "migrating identities" and "ordered chaos" obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "abandoned hopes"/"surrendered dreams" and the redundant explanation of what the pearl contains after showing it. Template cadence appears in "He noted...He moved...He stepped" openings. The prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("frail cone of light through the gloom") but suffers from abstract nominalizations ("suffocating accumulation of despair") and some purple patches ("condensed emotional luminescence of these surrendered dreams").

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though repetitive "He [verb]" structures appear in clusters (paragraphs 15-20). Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece well. Template cadence runs and some paraphrase loops ("forgiveness was a current, not a destination" / "The path to self-forgiveness was uncharted") reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm that mirrors the story's pulsing light. Information density is high—most sentences advance both atmosphere and plot mechanics. Some repetitive phrasing appears ("propagation delay" used 6 times, "cyclically reversed" 3 times) that could be trimmed, and occasional elevated diction ("bioluminescence," "propagation") slightly strains the intimate register.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("ice crystal drinking it in, sealing the perforations with a soft chime"). However, several instances of overwriting appear: "mulberry ache" lacks clear sensory grounding, "perforated destiny" becomes repetitive, and some metaphors strain ("balancing a snowflake on a sword's edge"). The final paragraph contains mild paraphrase loops around the seed/destiny concept.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the static of a planet shedding its energy") but occasional overwriting ("the fragile threshold of stillness between life's echo and absolute silence"). "Radiant hush" repeats, and some abstract phrasing could be more concrete. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing atmosphere, stakes, or ritual mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, though several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "contentment wasn't a destination but the act of tending" followed immediately by restatement. Template cadence appears in "She touched...She descended...She would teach" sequence, and abstract phrases like "forgiveness's quiet courage" lack the specificity of stronger passages.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "conscience for hire"/"paid to untangle others' moral knots" and "sincerely insincere"/"projecting calm certainty while feeling utterly adrift." Template cadence appears in "He'd mastered...Yet tonight...The chimes shifted" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm but suffers from overwriting: "velvety silence," "hypnotic precision," "ghostly smear" accumulate without earning their density. Template phrases like "tears tracking through dust" and "weight of decades unraveled" read as workshop familiar. The final paragraph's "language of sycamores" strains for profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves lyric density with lines doing multiple jobs—"centuries of layered dust coating his threadbare robes like a second skin" establishes time, poverty, and burial simultaneously. Some repetition of "pulse" and "pattern" concepts edges toward loop territory but serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good density, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "magic survived in the spaces between keystrokes and calculations" closely echoes earlier sentiment; "the sacred lived in the simple" repeats the core theme multiple times. The phrase "brilliant dimness" appears three times. These redundancies dull the accumulative effect.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally strong prose with varied rhythm, but multiple instances of overwriting diminish momentum: "ascending stars," "skeletal ribs," "liquid twilight." Template cadence appears in the discovery sequence ("He traced...," "Another vow...," "But the heart..."). Mixed metaphor with "meteor hush" in a submarine setting strains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some overwriting in opening ("dying embers after the universe contracts") and occasional abstraction ("wavelength align with purpose"). No significant loops or scaffolding. Final line effectively recharges the prophecy.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some abstract emotional language ("shattered her," "wound that never closed") and elevated diction clusters ("ephemeral whispers into tangible truths") create occasional density issues. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" openings mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition ("drip-drip-drip"). Information density high—most sentences advance both action and atmosphere. Some figurative excess: "clutched to his chest like a dead child" jars against the contemplative tone. Minor template cadence in "He'd measured... He channeled..." sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum through varied sentence structures. Multiple instances of template phrasing ("She remembered," "She would," "She began") and some filter-verb clustering reduce immediacy. The "precisely humane" insertion feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant repetition plagues the prose: "ancient freshness" appears three times, multiple variations of logic/intuition synthesis, and redundant emotional beats (wonder described repeatedly). Template cadence runs ("She packed... She glanced... She had spent...") and overwritten metaphors obscure momentum. The final third especially suffers from paraphrase loops restating the central realization.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant repetition issues: "watcher's burden" appears 6 times, "trust" 11 times, "muscle memory" 5 times, creating synonym churn rather than accumulation. Template cadence pervades ("She'd trained...She'd seen...She'd revised"). The prose lacks propulsion, with many sentences restating rather than advancing ("Trust dies in the gap between knowing and doing" followed immediately by "muscle memory became her scripture").

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from abstract phrasing in crucial beats: "channeled the martial art that sliced through pretense," "weaving his numb stillness with vibrant energy." Multiple filter constructions ("Aris felt," "He visualized," "He understood") distance the reader from immediacy. The vivification sequence relies on telling over concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues undermine momentum: "storm-born silence" appears 5 times, "nocturnal haven" 3 times, "safeguarding space" variants 4 times. Template cadence runs appear ("He remembered... He carefully dug... He placed... He thought..."). The phrase "across the hush" feels forced and opaque. Information density is low—multiple paragraphs restate the innovation theme without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "the pull cord handle of the oldest leaf blower felt like a baton, its frayed rope worn smooth by desperate hands." Some metaphor density in places ("leviathan," "tomb," "sentinels") but serves the accumulative mode. Minor template cadence in the blower startup sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dense, purposeful prose with strong rhythm variation, but several instances of abstract phrasing dilute immediacy: "dimensionally homesick," "interiorizing exteriors." Some conceptual redundancy around fear/uncertainty. The clarity at closure remains strong, preventing lower scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several issues: redundant phrasing ("fragile hope"/"fragile, burning heart"), abstract descriptors ("quiet despair," "crushing weight"), and the final paragraph's summary-heavy construction. The "when the penny drops" insertion feels artificially placed rather than organic to the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the climactic revelation. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive use of "serenely electric" (3x) and some abstract phrasing around cosmic concepts that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves momentum with varied sentence structures and clear spatial choreography. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple elements. Minor template cadence appears mid-story ("He heard...then three sharp blasts") and some elevated diction ("ardent," "transience") creates occasional register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in sensory description of the thread. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "rational enchantment" appears four times with similar phrasing, and "memories altered/altering" recycles across multiple paragraphs. The phrase "fever dream architect" repeats mechanically without variation, creating template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose suffers from density issues with excessive modifiers ("cold, pitted surface," "quiet intensity," "somber marvel") and some conceptual redundancy around the edge geometry explanation. Template phrasing appears in "Aris stood," "Aris placed," "Aris felt." However, the final image lands cleanly and key sentences like "They gave us unfolded horizons" achieve strong compression.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like "whispers threading through the damp air like cobwebs against skin" but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently in high-pressure beats. Template cadence emerges in "She'd spent years... She'd seen blueprints... She sprinted." The paraphrase loop of "vulnerable voices" weakens momentum. Information density is uneven with some scaffolding phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in quieter moments ("cathedral of ruin," "tombstones," "swirled like ghosts") and occasional redundancy ("crashing hush" appears 3 times). The escape sequence achieves excellent propulsion through syntax that mirrors urgency. Minor template patterns in some constructions but nothing that obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery but suffers from occasional overwriting—"luminous green-blue stone beneath three feet of snow" could be tighter. Some conceptual redundancy appears in explaining the death certificate error twice. The "wisdom from failure" construction appears multiple times without variation, creating mild template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong imagery but occasional overwriting appears ("liquid thought," "symphony of whispers trapped in time"). Information density is generally high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some template cadence in the middle ("He began," "He was," "He focused") disrupts flow. The final lines achieve clean propulsion without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of genuine beauty but suffers from overwriting in places—"root-tangled cathedral," "a harmony untamed," "frostbitten hope" pile up without always advancing pressure. Some paraphrase loops appear ("She was metamorphosing...Her body began to rise" restates without addition). Template cadence emerges in the floating sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive use of "resonantly soft" (three times) and some elevated register that occasionally obscures immediacy ("sluggish pulse," "subsonic plea"). The closing image lands cleanly despite these minor frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. However, some phrases edge toward overwriting ("fragile thunderstorm in a bottle, its glass cold against his ribs, crackling with contained lightning") and there's occasional register drift into more literary diction than the POV warrants.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("cobwebs thick as burial shrouds," "liquid light that seemed to seep into the very air"). However, abstract phrasing clusters in key beats: "interpreting silence not as emptiness but as possibility," "pocket of life sustained by divine debris," "bridge built not with nails, but with sound." Some template cadence in "He began...He sang...He stopped" sequence. The figurative density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good information density, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("seeking the same elusive heart" echoes earlier phrasing, "silent reawakening" repeats concept). The extended single-paragraph structure, while creating textural accumulation, occasionally buries key beats that would benefit from paragraph breaks for emphasis.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some figurative density feels overwrought ("islands scattered like broken teeth"). Template cadence appears in the photography sequence ("She'd capture...She'd photograph"). The word "vitalize" appears twice unnaturally. Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like "solidified starlight" and "the hush of cosmic possibility," but suffers from repetitive structures ("She saw...She reached...She poured"). Some abstract passages like "the mind stretching to hold the unholdable" lack concrete grounding. Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting during the transformation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, several instances of explanatory scaffolding ("she'd learned," "she knew theory meant nothing without touch") and slight overwriting in metaphors ("serpent's spine," "broken teeth") reduce immediacy without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several passages contain synonym loops and conceptual redundancy: "forgotten library held its breath at the hush" doubles quietness; "reversible exile" explained multiple ways without added pressure. Template phrasing appears ("She walked backwards no longer"). However, key moments like "The exile's in the crack" land cleanly, and the final image avoids overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery—"petals shimmering like captured sky," "droplet hovering above her palm like a fallen star." Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting in the spectral sequence and some template phrasing ("She moved through," "She closed her eyes") that could be more varied.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("each knotted strand a captured sigh, a stifled prayer"), overwriting creates density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff ("filament of pure silence, cold and heavy, coiled into her waiting palm"). Template cadence appears in the spirit-release sequences where similar structures repeat across encounters.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density high—most sentences advance discovery or deepen atmosphere. Some figurative density in peak moments ("bled saints into ghosts," "monuments to division") but serves the accumulative texture. Minor repetition of "fresco" and "vault" but functions as anchoring. The phrase "methodically curious" appears twice, creating slight echo.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "perpetual night" and "frozen motion within its liquid world." Some overwriting appears: "silent, suffocating plunge" and redundant phrases like "gently" with "retrieved." The extended metaphorical passages occasionally slow momentum but don't obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though "driftingly alert" appears twice verbatim and "tinkersong wonder" risks becoming a template phrase. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("liquid smoke," "neon veins") without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("auroras danced like living silk") with varied syntax and purposeful paragraph structure. However, repetitive "she [verb]" constructions appear in clusters, and some passages loop concepts (anguish/joy restated multiple ways) without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("scattered embers," "coiled tight with stored moments") but suffers from overwriting in emotional beats. Template structures appear ("She adjusted...She recorded...She'd developed") and figurative density overwhelms clarity in places. The epilogue contains multiple paraphrase loops explaining the story's meaning, and several metaphors strain credibility ("the cosmos itself bore witness").

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("fingers dipping into the vial, applying the liquid metal with a stylus no thicker than a hair") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("fractally precise" appears 4 times) and abstract flourishes ("fleeting testament to the attempt"). Filter verb clusters ("felt," "feeling") in the final paragraph dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing discovery, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "stranded luminance" concept explained twice, multiple restatements of the pattern-discovery process. Template cadence appears in "Square three: starlings spiraled counterclockwise; square seven: a wedge formation; square two: sudden stillness." Some overwriting in figurative language ("spilled ink," "cosmic punctuation") without full payoff. The prose is competent but lacks the propulsive clarity needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. However, several instances of elevated diction ("temporal splinters," "celestial clockwork") and some redundancy in describing the Hall of Mirrors reduce momentum. The paraphrase loop around "rhythm of repair" and "heartbeat within broken gears" triggers minor deduction. Information density is high in most passages.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum. Strong opening anchors and final image. Deductions for repetitive "ghost" usage (11 times), some abstract phrasing ("strangely trustworthy" repeated), and occasional overwriting ("colossal floating rock arches, remnants of the planet's unstable core"). Template cadence in "They hadn't... only the..." construction.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density high in places ("fractals of sound mirroring the lighthouse's beam"). However, repetitive sentence openings ("Elias," "He" starts 11+ sentences) create template cadence. Some paraphrase loops ("time's final ripple" concept restated). Mixed metaphor of clock having a "heart" that "stutters like a dying star" strains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is strong—most lines advance plot while building atmosphere. Minor redundancies appear ("forgotten blueprint" mentioned twice as "forgotten," "offhandedly exact" repeated verbatim) but don't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose shows strong moments like "polymer chemist's hands brushing sediment" but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most high-pressure beats ("grief had tightened like cross-linked polymers," "fractured waterways reflected his fractured soul"). Template cadence appears in "He'd [verb]" constructions, and several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("separation wasn't termination but transformation" restated multiple ways).

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm supporting the accumulative mode. Information density is high, especially in descriptions of the library and void-measurement. Minor repetition of "mindfully scattered" and some abstract phrasing ("electric potential of a sentence not yet written") create slight drag.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("sand crumbling like stale bread beneath her nails"), but some overwriting in metaphor density ("ghost of oceans long buried," "frozen breath") and conceptual repetition around memory/remorse. The phrase "emotionally contagious through touch" appears awkwardly technical, and final paragraphs contain mild paraphrase loops about transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "the Prague Astronomical Clock's brass gears whispering secrets only she deciphered under the hush of borrowed starlight" establishes setting, character expertise, and atmosphere. Some figurative excess: "dried tears," "frightened child" metaphors in quick succession. Template cadence appears briefly: "She'd spent...She wasn't just...She adjusted." Overall propulsion remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery ("fallen stars," "fractured pieces"). Some redundancy in the memory sequence with multiple "He saw/felt" constructions creating minor template cadence. A few abstract phrases ("profound transformation," "psychic rubble") could be more concrete. Information density is good with most lines advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is adequate with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some metaphor mixing occurs ("seeds of vigilance" that can "blaze") and occasional template phrasing appears ("She understood now," "This was the moment"). The "latent blaze" repetition feels somewhat forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves strong sensory density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The porcelain amplifies vibrations too faint for human ears—the wood's memory of wind, drought, and the axe's first bite" layers history, physics, and emotion efficiently. However, some conceptual repetition appears ("empathy in motion" recurs without evolution) and abstract phrases like "resonant understanding" could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm shifts between reflection and discovery, particularly in the accelerating sequence from sunset to revelation. Information density is generally strong, with lines carrying multiple functions (setting, character state, thematic weight). However, template cadence appears in "He + verb" constructions across multiple paragraphs, and some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("silent language," "beauty in the difficult"). The filter-verb cluster around key moments ("He saw it then," "He remembered") reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("night-blooming cereus," "heartbeat of reconciliation") with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the tuning fork sequence. However, some abstract phrasing ("path to empathy," "eclectic pacifist soul alight with purpose") and repetitive constructions around silence cataloging create minor density issues without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several issues: redundant phrasing ("serenity within motion" appears 4 times), some elevated diction mismatched to POV ("repositories of observation"), and filter verb clusters in observation scenes. The compound adjectives ("olfactorily sensitive nose") feel overwrought. Information density is strong in descriptive passages but loops appear in thematic statements.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("magnetized to the hull," "luminescent fruit"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for redundancy ("gathered, remembered, and carried forward"), some filter constructions ("she realized," "she felt"), and the final paragraph's slight drift toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the respirator establishes both setting toxicity and her professional preparedness). Some template cadence appears mid-story ("She noted...She documented...She thought") and minor paraphrase loops around wind measurement descriptions. The opening and closing lines effectively bracket the piece with voice and resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    Repetitive phrasing pervades the text: "Kael" appears 19 times, "wonder" 15 times, creating synonym churn around the central concept. Template cadence emerges in sequences like "He waited... Then... He raised... He followed..." The philosophical declarations in the final third ("Without it, humanity was a hollow shell") stall momentum. Information density suffers from paraphrase loops restating wonder's importance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments like "the canyon hush pressing down like a physical weight, thick and expectant as snow before an avalanche." However, template cadence appears in "She reached...she began...She had spent" and some paraphrase loops exist ("avalanchingly quiet" variations). The modifier density in places like "painstakingly positioned according to forgotten star charts" occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("language of angles and sorrow") and occasional abstract phrasing ("mathematics of emotion" appears multiple times). The writing serves the accumulative mode but has moments of mild overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic variation and vivid imagery but suffers from density issues - nearly every sentence contains figurative language ("ghostly light," "hollow ache," "coil like a waiting serpent"). Template patterns appear ("He saw not just...but," "no longer...but") and some metaphors strain (ridgeway as both "frozen river" and "tomb").

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("tears froze on her cheeks as the implications crashed over her"). However, template cadence appears in places ("She sensed...She focused...She placed"), and some metaphors edge toward purple prose without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Some density issues in peak moments ("the raveling silence was complete, but the message had flown"). Minor template cadence in "She felt... She had... She didn't..." sequence. Information density high but occasionally tips into overwriting ("stoically sparkling" appears twice).

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts, but several overwriting issues: mixed metaphor ("shadows over the gnarled fruit trees struggling"), repetitive "azure" usage, and some scaffold phrasing ("Taking a slow, deliberate breath"). The final third maintains better momentum with cleaner, more propulsive sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and controlled rhythm. However, several instances of elevated register ("residual chroniton decay," "cyclically spontaneous nature") and some abstract phrasing ("crushing pressure," "profound, resonant gravity") that could be more concrete. No major loops or scaffolding, but density sometimes obscures momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("where dawn would eventually bleed through") but suffers from periodic overwriting - "haunted space," "silent echo," "fragile chain of trust" accumulate without always advancing pressure. Some paraphrase loops around the safety/protection concept. Line-level craft is competent but occasionally purple.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from ornamental density with figurative language in most sentences ("flickering like lightning given voice," "memories of earth's first light"). Template repetition appears in "She knew...She pictured...She recalled" sequence. Abstract phrasing like "weaving twilight into hope" and "condensed memories of earth's first light" obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several instances of overwriting and abstract phrasing weaken momentum: "magnetize stories" appears multiple times without variation, "quietly explosive" recurs without clear meaning, some metaphors strain ("moths to lantern light"). The prose achieves moments of beauty but needs tightening, particularly in the middle third where reflection dominates action.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though several abstract passages weaken momentum ("living archive of sorrow," "quiet exchange between earth and heart"). Strong opening with the pin drop and solid final image. Some filter-verb clustering around discovery moments ("He saw it then," "Aris understood") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("glass fruit glowed with captured starlight") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently in emotional beats. Some paraphrase loops exist ("woven dawns...unraveled thread by thread" followed immediately by similar restatement). Information density is strong when describing the transformation but occasionally stalls on abstract emotional summary.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure, but contains scaffold phrases ("She wanted to hide, to lock...to vanish") and repetitive "She [verb]" constructions in key beats. The phrase "enlarged tranquility" appears twice without evolution, and some metaphors feel strained ("quiet so vast it seemed to breathe").

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("ivy strangled marble statues") but suffers from abstract patches and some repetitive constructions. "Tenuous absolution" appears twice, "heuristically gentle" twice, creating mild loops. Several sentences begin with "She'd" creating template cadence. The writing is competent but lacks the consistent precision needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing atmosphere or action, though some figurative language feels forced ("dust motes hung suspended like frozen stars"). The story suffers from repetitive phrasing around "luminous vows" and "edge of oblivion" that creates loops. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions, and the elevated diction occasionally obscures rather than clarifies the action.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("silence crashed down, heavier than before") but suffers from repetitive sentence openings ("She + verb" appears 15+ times) creating template cadence. Multiple paraphrase loops exist: "false start" concepts reiterated without advancement. The "comforting unease" phrase appears twice unchanged. Information density is moderate—some paragraphs could be cut without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("aurora bled emerald," "ghost of a pre-Collapse summer") but several instances of abstract telling ("pure, desperate science") and some filter-verb clustering ("she realized," "she finally understood"). The forest election metaphor, while evocative, creates slight conceptual muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments like "tears traced clean paths through the dust on her cheeks" show precision. However, abstract phrases accumulate: "auroral sorrow," "exhausting clarity," "profound, expectant quiet," "unbearable weight of release." The "inescapable calling" appears three times with minimal variation. These density issues don't obscure closure but prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Some template cadence in discovery sequence ("She touched...She gathered...She returned"). Filter verb stack in paragraph 3 ("she realized...she began...she noticed") creates mild drag. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some paraphrase loops appear ("glisten of the iceberg fragment intensified" repeated conceptually). Strong opening and closing lines, but "symphony of truth" and similar abstractions occasionally drift toward template phrasing in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with moments of strong imagery ("sand pouring in like a slow tide"). However, abstract phrases accumulate: "nostalgia clung to him like desert dust," "wave against the static," "mosaic of meaning." Template cadence appears in "He knelt...He lifted...He recalled" sequence. The final image lands cleanly despite these friction points.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from template phrases like "her voice steady," "tears glistened on wrinkled cheeks," and repetitive "sandstorm calm." Information density is moderate with some paraphrase loops around the theme of listening and healing. The final paragraph explicitly states themes rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of strong rhythm but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears too frequently without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in "She picked up...She realized...She began" sequence. Some overwriting ("mysterious familiarity wrapping around her like a second skin") dulls momentum. Information density varies, with some redundant description.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the dock-side lanterns suddenly brighter as he walked home through the gleaming silence") with strong sensory specificity. However, figurative density overwhelms in places ("gravity pockets siphoning his past, storing it where the salt grew") and some metaphors strain credibility. The paraphrase loop between "deleted memories" and "lost thoughts" creates minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "terrestrially cosmic" repetition, some purple passages ("liquid silence," "nocturnal haven cradling her solitude"), and occasional template phrasing ("She breathed with...letting it fill"). The filter verb "felt" appears multiple times in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery, though several instances of overwriting appear: "meteors streaked silver across the velvet sky" and "roots seeking water" as metaphor for deepening conversation. Information density is high but occasionally tips into purple prose. The repetition of "agreed upon lie" works as pattern-teaching rather than redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures and over-reliance on abstract descriptors ("tragically radiant" appears multiple times). Template cadence emerges in sequential "She [verb]" constructions. Information density is moderate but several passages restate rather than advance ("The memory was now securely archived" followed by similar confirmations).

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("Time moved as stalactites drip") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "pearl twilight" (appears 4 times) and some abstract constructions. The phrase "wisely enduring" appears twice identically. Information density is generally good but some sentences merely restate ("a key with no apparent lock" explained multiple times).

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows moments of beauty ("liquid silver," "stars pulsed like distant heartbeats") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Kaela's breath hitched," "Kaela's pulse quickened," "Kaela's throat tightened") and some overwriting in figurative density. The template cadence of "She [verb]" appears multiple times, creating rhythmic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("steel coffin three hundred fathoms down") and good information density. However, some abstract phrasing weakens immediacy ("unbroken essence of those lost," "fractured narrative into something whole"). Minor template cadence in the dream sequence descriptions and occasional filter constructions ("Elara focused") that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("moon paths—slender ribbons of reflected lunar light") but suffers from density issues and occasional overwriting. Phrases like "scintillatingly somber" appear multiple times, and some sentences carry excessive figurative weight. The whistle sequence and tea ritual maintain strong momentum, but earlier passages accumulate modifiers that slow propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like "ochre clouds swallowing the dying sun" but suffers from repetitive structures ("She scanned," "She knelt," "She carefully placed"). Several paraphrase loops appear: "comfortable lies" echoes multiple times without variation, and "excavate truth from those lies" restates the motivation redundantly. Information density is uneven, with some passages over-explaining what's already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax and strong specific verbs ("traced," "hammered," "coalesced"). Information density high in radio fragments that advance plot while building atmosphere. Deductions for scattered template constructions ("fingers flying over," "heart hammered against ribs"), some filter verb accumulation, and the abstract "gritty determination hardened her whimsy" that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong opening imagery. Repetition of "positively wistful" and some elevated diction ("achingly pure," "gleaned redemption") creates mild register drift. The phrase "sweetened melody" appears twice close together. Information density is high but occasional redundancy ("desolate loft" after establishing isolation) reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from overwriting in places ("azure coat flapping like a wounded bird," multiple descriptive chains). Several template constructions appear ("He felt," "He began," "He adjusted"). The single-paragraph structure creates density issues - no breathing room or visual rhythm. Some redundancy in describing the ice's groaning and the Tower's resonance. Information density is uneven.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("The revolution wasn't a war cry; it was the quiet act of remembering their strength") but suffers from occasional redundancy ("patience bloomed—a patient revolution") and some overwriting in metaphorical density. The line-level craft supports the accumulative structure but could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose generally propels with varied rhythm, but several template constructions appear ("She remembered... She stood... She walked"). Some metaphorical density in emotional beats ("His smile was a cage") works thematically but occasionally slows momentum. The "consequences be damned" cliché weakens the crucial closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("dust motes...silent testament") but suffers from repetitive use of "aptly deliberate" (3x) and "vibrant hush" (4x), creating template cadence. Some lines approach purple prose ("the vibrant hush wrapping around him like a vow"), and the final paragraphs contain paraphrase loops about deserving and second chances.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Deductions for occasional template cadence ("Zephyr recalled...Zephyr believed...Zephyr clambered"), some filter-verb clustering in middle section, and abstract phrasing ("distilled essence of human longing"). Information density is moderate; most lines advance story but some paraphrase loops exist ("It wasn't just math; it was the distilled essence...").

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "deleted files weren't gone—they were shredded into fragments, scattered across the system" restates rather than advances. Template cadence appears in the fragment recovery sequence ("She found...," "She realized...," "She wrote..."). The metaphorical language ("digital heartbeat," "archive's hunger") occasionally muddles rather than clarifies the technical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves density through compound images like "apple trees sighing above the groaning ice floes" but suffers from repetitive stems ("Silas" opens 14 sentences). The "weighted breath before reply" phrase appears four times, creating template cadence. Strong information density when describing mirror visions but some filter-verb clustering ("Silas watched," "Silas felt").

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"sterile clinic air sharp with antiseptic and the ghost of failed euthanasia" establishes setting, backstory, and tone simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("fleeting calm earned only through motion") and occasional abstract phrasing ("fold in patience") create minor friction. No loops or scaffolding, momentum sustained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation, but several instances of abstract phrasing dilute momentum ("intersubjective understanding," "immovable stones of circumstance"). Some filter-verb clustering in the middle section. The paraphrase loop around "destined mismatches" and "mismatched longing" costs clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines serving multiple purposes—"the fine sand yielding silently beneath her feet" advances action while maintaining atmosphere. Some figurative density in peak moments ("dance at the edge of sight," "conversation held in the language of pressure") but coherent within the established lyrical mode. Minor scaffold in explaining the clearing's nature rather than fully dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and effective figurative language ("swallowing brick and iron in slow, green triumph"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("the gentle, earnest whimsy of roots breaking stone") and some repetitive phrasing around the healing concept that borders on thematic redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is moderate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. Significant deductions for metaphor density in non-pattern beats ("cathedral of certainty," "tomb for obsolete truths," "fragile as spun glass") and some paraphrase loops around the silence/hush concept. The "weathered innocence" phrase feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose density serves the accumulative mode with lines like "fog curled around sculptures he'd built from salvage," though occasional redundancy appears ("desperate to mark the spot, to trap the resonance"). Some filter constructions ("He saw the log, then static. He saw his own hands") create mild drag but support the disorientation pattern. Template cadence in the "He saw...He saw" sequence triggers -0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dense figurative language overwhelms several beats ("lunar observatory...impossibly above the clouds," "thin air where Earth's atmosphere thinned to near-vacuum"). Run-on sentences compromise clarity, particularly the 89-word opener. However, momentum builds effectively toward closure, and the final image lands cleanly despite earlier convolution.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "needed not more treatments, but a flawless goodbye" followed immediately by similar restatement. Template cadence appears in "She gathered...This shard...It was..." sequence. Overwriting in metaphorical density ("fading like an old photograph left in the sun," "calm harbor in the storm of endings") without pattern-teaching, particularly dense in opening third.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves clarity and some evocative moments ("Moonlight bled through the observatory's fractured crystal dome"), but suffers from repetitive structures and occasional overwriting. Template cadence appears in sequences like "She placed... She selected... She inserted" and paraphrase loops around the sealed awakening concept. The technical descriptions maintain precision but sometimes sacrifice momentum for exposition. Final image lands cleanly despite these frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with strong metaphorical control and varied syntax. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("She'd been so certain magic was folly" followed by "her certainty had been arrogance"), and some passages lean purple ("carving a cleft in certainty that left her worldview fractured like dropped porcelain"). Information density could be higher in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant overwriting issues pervade the text, particularly metaphor density in high-pressure beats ("memories resurface" appears twice verbatim, mixed metaphors like "weight of longing settled in her palms"). Template cadence runs appear in the village scene ("Children gasped... elders smiled... Elara watched"). The prose achieves moments of beauty but sacrifices clarity and momentum to ornamental language.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery like "skeletal remains of server racks draped in emerald velvet." Some overwriting appears in metaphor density ("honeyed hush" repeated, "amber pendant" heavily freighted). The "universe whispering" and several abstract phrases like "grafting new meaning" create mild opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts (shorter during the soldier's dissolution). Information density is good—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or conflict simultaneously. Deductions for repetitive "solemnized" creating template cadence (-0.4) and some abstract phrasing ("weight of unwritten endings," "silent judgment") that could be more concrete. The "whisper of closing pages" metaphor effectively bridges literal and thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density, but suffers from overwriting in peak moments—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Mixed metaphors appear ("threads of light," "luminous ropes," "roots") and some template cadence emerges in descriptive passages, dulling momentum despite generally clean grammar and varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Her gnarled hands, scarred from decades of flash-paper alchemy" establishes character, history, and stakes simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("cartography of the soul," "viscous time") occasionally strains but serves the alchemical voice. The final sentence achieves exceptional closure through image rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs ("gears like frozen leaves, springs coiled in defeat"). Some overwriting appears in metaphor clusters ("wounded season," "cellar of reason," "vessel of lost sound") but serves the accumulative mode. Minor template cadence in the light-angle sequence but information density compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of key phrases that accumulate meaning. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("bronze grotto seemed to breathe") and some template cadence in the collection sequences ("She approached...She lifted...").

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty—"shavings curled away like memories"—with strong rhythmic control in the carving sequence. However, repetitive structures ("She sat," "She remembered," "She picked up") and some abstract grief language ("contain the uncontainable," "hollow space") create mild momentum drag. The paraphrase loop around "rust-hued peace" appearing three times dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and selective detail. Strong verb choices ("waded," "plucking," "coiled") drive action. Minor redundancies appear ("eroded"/"erosion," "fractured"/"fragments") but don't obscure closure. The final image of "waiting for the next scavenger" effectively recharges the cycle without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves strong information density with most sentences advancing multiple layers, though some abstraction creeps in ("equations for hope" appears 4 times creating mild redundancy). Several passages edge toward overwriting ("monument to fleeting joy," "canvas for creation") without pattern-teaching. Line-level craft is generally clean but occasional template cadence emerges ("She ran...She pocketed...She needed").

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and sensory density. However, "excruciatingly gentle" appears four times creating template cadence (-0.6), "glacial hush" five times borders on repetitive (-0.4), and some elevated register drift in peak moments ("profound, quiet assertion"). The sanctuary descriptors cycle through similar phrases. Information density is high but marred by these pattern artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally maintains clarity and momentum, with effective variation in sentence length and structure. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("serene upheaval," "thoughtfully clear precision") and near-repetitions ("training instincts" appears four times) create minor drag, particularly in the middle third where exposition accumulates.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density with lines like "Fog rolled across the harbor like a slow, breathing tide." Information density generally strong—most sentences advance multiple layers. However, metaphor density in places ("fossilized storm holding back the dark") and some redundancy ("silent archivists who'd once encoded...their knowledge now nearly lost") create mild drag without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs: "Moonlight silvered the thread's crimson strands, turning it into a vein of frozen blood." Some overwriting in metaphor density during projection sequences ("phantom weight," "silent companion," "house of mirrors") but doesn't obscure closure. Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dense, purposeful prose with strong information density—most sentences advance multiple layers simultaneously. However, runs of similar participial constructions appear ("holding it," "stained with oil," "driven by his feverish hypothesizing") and some elevated diction borders on purple ("liquid lightning," "captured star"). The closing sentence runs 42 words, straining clarity at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but several instances of near-repetition weaken momentum ("Kelp-drift peace" appears twice identically). The metaphorical density occasionally obscures clarity, particularly in peak moments. Template cadence appears in "She'd [verb]" constructions. The prose achieves moments of beauty but lacks the consistent precision needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though some overwriting appears ("luminous skeptic," "sidereal patience"). Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple purposes. Template cadence in fountain catalog ("Fountain of Whispers...Fountain of Lullabies...Fountain of Regrets") and some abstract phrasing ("psychic sludge") create minor drag. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful repetition that builds texture. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. However, some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("troubling serenity," "weight of her lineage"), and occasional overwriting appears ("delicate as cosmic lace, sighed downward in slow, silent cascades"). The repeated "quiet sigh of falling petals" works as pattern but risks becoming precious.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and careful rhythm modulation—short, sharp observations alternating with longer accumulative passages. Information density high throughout, with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for slight overwriting in places ("fiercely meditative" appears twice) and one instance of elevated diction ("cathedral for the living and the lost") that briefly breaks voice consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several instances of overwriting mar otherwise strong prose: "searing reverie" appears twice, abstract phrases like "incremental absolution" and "shared balance" repeat without variation, and some sentences strain with multiple subordinate clauses. The density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("ink-black waves," "skeletal spires," "frozen midnight") creates mild coherence friction.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments—"each echo held a shape, a distinct contour of the weaver's unspoken purpose"—but suffers from repetitive "tenderly organized" and some overwrought phrases like "cobalt silo stood stark." Information density is generally good with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. The paraphrase loop around "uncharted echoes" and "shape of intentions" creates minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("kingfisher feather quill nib, its iridescent blue tip catching the weak winter light") but suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around the central concepts. Multiple instances of "groundedly imaginative" and variations on "constraint/innovation" create synonym churn. Template cadence appears in sequential "He'd" constructions. The piece maintains clarity but lacks the propulsive efficiency needed for higher scores, with some sentences doing single rather than multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows careful craft but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff ("ember alcove's warmth a fragile counterpoint," "atmospheric ghosts," "hesitant readers"). Some paraphrase loops exist ("dust was telling stories" followed immediately by explanation). The writing is competent but occasionally overwrought, particularly in emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments of sensory precision but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("fleeting emotion" appears 4 times, "crystallize/crystallizing" 5 times, "incomplete information" 3 times). Several passages contain paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate without advancing ("Safety had been a story they all told themselves, as fragile as the porcelain mask she wore—shards held together by glue and denial, destined to fail"). Template cadence appears in the "She [verb]" pattern across multiple paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally clear with good information density, particularly in the sediment layer descriptions doing multiple jobs. Template cadence appears in "He'd scribble...They spoke...Phil knew" sequence. Several paraphrase loops around the "competing narratives" concept and some filter verb stacks in emotional beats reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("shelves bowed under the weight of forgotten histories") but suffers from abstract telling ("the unlearning of hatred," "erosion of the shared language of empathy") and repetitive phrasing around the theme. The "weeks passed" summary and conceptual redundancy around noise/silence/harmony weakens momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several template phrases weaken momentum ("It was informally wise," "synaptic plasticity" appears twice with similar phrasing). The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("rust devoured the support beams") but suffers from occasional overwriting and filter-verb clusters ("she realized," "she recalled").

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose has moments of strong imagery ("nectar dusk bled," "mournful sigh of wind") but suffers from repetitive structures and some overwriting. Template cadence appears ("She opened," "She felt," "She touched"). The Chinese character "取出" is a jarring artifact. Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with most lines doing multiple jobs. Rhythm varies naturally without algorithmic patterns. Deduction for scattered metaphoric density in non-peak moments ("creeping normality noticer," "hushed blaze") and one instance of elevated diction ("inadvertently profound") that creates mild register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple elements. Deductions for some overwrought phrases ("dissolved like the city's foundations"), repetitive "truth" constructions in the revelation sequence, and occasional template phrasing ("With infinite care"). No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("hairline fracture near the three-spot"), though several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("captured it—the missed opportunity wasn't the door itself, but the suspended breath before refusal, a sensation now real"). Template cadence appears in "He'd calculated...He'd been...He'd captured" sequence. Information density is high when describing the rupture and void's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("smog pressed like wet wool") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing. Several instances of elevated diction that could be more grounded ("methodically hopeful," "fragile clarity"). Some redundancy in describing the moon's glow across paragraphs. Information density is moderate with room for tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.8)
    The opening paragraph runs 200+ words as a single sentence, creating density that obscures key information. Multiple compound modifiers ("emerald-tinted," "water-eroded," "sun-drenched") cluster without advancing pressure. Template constructions appear ("Elara saw...Elara clutched...") and the prose occasionally loops concepts (displacement mentioned four times with minimal variation). The final paragraph maintains better momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dense, purposeful prose with strong momentum through most beats. Figurative language occasionally overwhelms ("ghostly lines connecting," "illuminating possibility," "space between one tick and the next") creating mild opacity. The repetition of "slow exhale of low tide" and some filter constructions ("she believed," "recognizing its significance instantly") reduce immediacy. Information density remains high despite these frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose creates atmosphere through specific imagery but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most high-pressure sentences ("like rotting jewels," "like maggots writhing in moonlight"). Some paraphrase loops occur ("Fear itself, drawn by her unbosomed confession" follows directly after she speaks her fear). Template cadence appears in the resolution sequence with repeated "She [verb]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dense figurative language sometimes obscures clarity ("sketched resonance," "fractal generating" repeated without clear mechanics). Some template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions mid-story. Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting, particularly with abstract musical concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("His hands, calloused and stained with ochre and ash, moved with quiet precision"). Some filter-verb clustering ("He believed," "He'd spent years") and occasional redundancy ("silent watchers" repeated) prevent higher scoring, but prose remains clean and propulsive overall.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant paraphrase loops plague the text: "noble lie" concepts repeat without advancement, and template constructions like "She [verb], [subordinate clause]" create monotonous rhythm. The prose also suffers from abstract summarizing ("moral erosion," "soothing deceptions") rather than concrete imagery, particularly in emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong verbs ("wrested," "bracing," "levered"). Information density is high with most lines advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("hushed blaze," "stoically sensitive") and some repetitive phrasing around "abandoned dreams" and "interlaced absence."

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good information density—most sentences advance discovery or atmosphere. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("dappled resolve," "reclaimed stillness") and some redundancy in describing her methodical approach. The final paragraph contains mild repetition about power returning. Strong syntactic variety and effective use of specific technical details about ink and paper.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("light felt like knives," "beauty that flayed her open"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some repetitive phrasing around "luminous torment" and "descends while ascending" but these function as intentional refrains rather than loops.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but "intangibly tangible" appears four times creating repetitive patterning. Some elevated diction ("voids," "manifesting") occasionally drifts from immediate embodiment, and filter constructions ("He remembered," "Aris recalled") accumulate in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum. Strong moments like "stones older than nations" and the star trail descriptions. However, several instances of overwriting: "bruised twilight sky," mixed metaphor in "holding their breath" for arches, and the abstract "frequency of belonging" phrase repeated without variation. Some filter verbs ("felt," "realized") dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("salt-bleached driftwood fragments through his calloused fingers"). However, several instances of overwriting: "shades of regret," "vibrant woman extinguished," and redundant phrasing around "weight of unspoken words" used multiple times. The filter verb "remembered" and telling phrases in the middle section slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts, as in "Dawn's approach meant the window was closing, the fragile truce hanging between apology and forgiveness." Information density is high throughout. Deductions for repetitive constructions ("He'd carried it... He'd found it") and some abstract phrasing ("the quiet calculus of lives measured against silence") that borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong moments ("gulls wheeled overhead," "poles marched like crooked teeth") but suffers from abstract emotional labeling ("Regret's backlash tightened his throat," "Flickering faith kept him moving"). Some paraphrase loops appear in the middle section about missed opportunities. The final paragraph achieves good momentum with concrete imagery, but earlier sections rely too heavily on emotional summary rather than embodied showing.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong sensory integration. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story functions. Notable weaknesses: therapy-speak phrases ("kindle empathy where none remained," "capacity for empathy already extinguished"), some abstract elevation ("jaded wonder"), and minor redundancy in thematic articulation. These artifacts don't touch the closure moment directly.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting—nearly every sentence contains figurative language. Several instances of elevated diction clash with emotional immediacy: "paradoxically steady vibration," "sacred theft." The extended compound sentences create syntactic monotony. Information density remains strong and no paraphrase loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, but figurative density occasionally obscures momentum—nearly every sentence contains metaphor or elevated description. Some redundancy in emotional articulation ("unbearable sweetness," "choking beauty"). The final paragraph's shift to cleaner prose effectively signals resolution, though earlier sections could benefit from more varied density.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("tears of catharsis flowed during meditation, her feet would drift from the floor") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in ritual description ("She focused...She'd spent...She selected"), and abstract phrases like "suffocating phantoms" and "ghostly resolve" accumulate without concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose suffers from overwriting with figurative language in most sentences ("black sand stretched toward the brooding volcano," "vibrant hush enveloped the shore") and abstract philosophical assertions. Template cadence appears ("He'd come seeking... He'd taken... He'd yearned"). The final paragraph explicitly moralizes rather than dramatizing.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density—most sentences advance multiple story elements. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "silent revolution" repeated four times, "cradle of sparks" echoed without variation. The metaphor "falling ash" for silent movement works well, but "bruised purples" feels like stock description.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff. Template cadence runs appear ("He recalled...Understanding dawned...He obeyed"). Some abstract phrasing ("hollow ache in his bones," "despair coiled") weakens otherwise strong sensory work. Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm that accelerates during the timing sequence. Information density is high—most lines advance both literal action and metaphorical meaning. Deductions for abstract phrases like "grief thinned to transparency" and "archaeology of pain" that approach purple prose, plus some repetition of "cartography" without sufficient variation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from overwriting - "diplomatically fierce," "lethal grace," "dignified chaos" pile up without earning their elevated register. Template constructions appear ("He recalled," "He traced," "He saw") and the metaphor "questions left unanswered often became destinations paved with steel" strains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, with vivid specificity in "prison-issue spoon" and "chips of obsidian." Some figurative density in peak moments ("liquid silver," "skeletal shelves") and occasional filter constructions ("felt the familiar") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("strategically creative in her despair," "steely longing hardened into resolve"). Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions, and the final tick provides clean propulsion, but some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and good momentum through the discovery-to-ritual sequence. Information density adequate with most lines advancing plot or atmosphere. Deductions for multiple instances of elevated register ("luminous doubt," "empirically whimsical," "resonance validating"), some paraphrase loops ("memory grove"/"collective memory" repetition), and occasional overwriting in descriptive passages that don't directly serve closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("blue of dawn after storm, of a held breath before confession") but suffers from abstract passages that slow momentum ("the color wasn't visual. It was the act of seeking itself"). Some filter constructions ("Kai understood," "He remembered") dull immediacy in crucial beats.


== Grader: DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences accelerate and breathe in step with the scene's needs. There is no scaffolding, synonym churn, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph's cadence shift is deliberate and effective. A single instance of near-paraphrase ("quiet accumulation" / "persistent, unassuming decay") is minor and does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor deductions for a tendency toward ornamental phrasing ("scorched testament," "drifting resonance") that, while beautiful, creates slight density in high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop ("purpose in the pauses" is reiterated) but it serves a thematic purpose. No major artifacts obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor figurative density in the final paragraphs ("liquid moonlight," "quiet fire") slightly softens the peak beat's clarity but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor instance of potential overwriting ("kelp and memory" could be seen as a slightly mixed metaphor), but it does not harm clarity or momentum. The closure image is rendered with crystalline precision.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, zero artifacts or loops. Figurative language serves pressure and closure without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and the final image is clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied sentence rhythms and no scaffolding or loops. Figurative language ("petals drifted like pale moths") is pattern-taught and pays off. Minor overwriting in "foggy lucidity" is offset by clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language ("like smoke caught in amber") is precise and purposeful. Rhythm is masterfully controlled, accelerating with the fragment's disintegration. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor artifacts: the phrase "staggering grace" repeats three times, nearing a template cadence, and one metaphor ("bricks shattered like dropped carnival glass") slightly strains. However, these do not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image. Information density is high, and sentences advance multiple elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the climax ("a perfect sonic negative of connection severed" feels slightly explanatory), but the sentence-level propulsion and clarity remain strong, and the closure image is undulled.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often advancing multiple elements. A minor deduction for a few instances of potentially overly lyrical phrasing ("fracturing it into liquid gold") that, while beautiful, slightly risk ornamentation in a high-pressure beat, though they remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with strong information density. A deduction for minor overwriting in a peak beat: "embodying weighty lightness: gravity tempered by joy" is a self-conscious, explanatory phrase that interrupts the narrative momentum. Otherwise, sentence-level craft is excellent, with varied rhythms and concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Minor register elevation ("electric hum of reclaimed agency") feels voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity. Sentence-level craft supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose exhibits exceptional rhythm and information density, with sentences advancing multiple jobs (e.g., "ambered hush" thick with meaning). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Minor deduction (-0.1) for a marginally dense metaphor ("wax pooling like frozen tears") in a high-pressure beat, though it remains coherent and does not harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A single, distinct artifact exists: the phrase "remarkably composed" is repeated three times, creating a slight template cadence that slightly dulls an otherwise exceptional line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without overwriting; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language ("thousand tiny, liquid stars") is precise and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the scene's tension, and the final line lands with resonant clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the description of light ("blooming and withering") which, while beautiful, borders on ornamentation in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for the slight repetition of the phrase "beating wings at rest," which, while purposeful, edges toward decorative in its third use. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are superb, with no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, precise imagery. Minor artifacts appear, including a slight over-density of metaphor in some sentences (e.g., "pages splayed like broken wings" following closely on other figurative language) and a near-paraphrase loop between "wordless conversation" and "silent plea." These do not significantly harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, though a few sentences in the first third approach overwriting ("a lattice designed to absorb contradictions without collapsing"). However, these do not harm closure clarity. Rhythm and syntax expertly modulate with emotional intensity, and there are no loops or scaffolds.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose has rhythmic control and high information density without artifacts. Figurative language ("beads clicking like counting bones") is coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and vivid, precise imagery. A minor deduction for a very slight template cadence in the description of the refuge ("regenerative silence bloomed – a profound quiet that didn’t merely lack sound, but actively mended") which creates a mild rhythmic echo. This does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, with high information density. However, some sentences verge on overwriting or mixed metaphor ("the ridge’s quiet exhale settling into her bones beneath the hush of dreaming roots"), creating minor artifacts that slightly obscure clarity and momentum, though they do not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "dragons seeming to writhe," "stitch in the tapestry of what had been") which, while evocative, slightly risks coherence. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and clear, advancing story and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is largely exceptional, with high information density and clear propulsion. However, a minor pattern artifact occurs in the climax: a cluster of slightly ornate phrases ("searing, narrow lance," "stark, moving pattern") creates a brief decorative flourish in a high-pressure beat. This prevents a 9+ score but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly accomplished with strong rhythm and vivid, precise imagery. Information density is excellent. A few minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a near-paraphrase loop ("unraveling stillness" / "unraveled at the edges") and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in the high-pressure final third ("time bled away," "hungry whispers"). Clarity and momentum remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is often exquisite and highly textured, achieving remarkable information density. However, a tendency toward dense figurative language and complex syntax in peak beats ("the upturned hush now a tangible force lifting her spirit") creates minor artifacts that slightly obscure causal clarity and momentum at the crucial closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and varied sentence structures that accelerate with pressure. Minor artifacts include occasional abstraction ("suspended moment, periodically eternal") and a template cadence in one beat ("He needed... He saw...").

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally concise and vivid, with high information density. A minor artifact occurs in the phrase "cautious exuberance," which is repeated and feels slightly label-like, detracting from the otherwise embodied emotional description. Otherwise, sentence-level propulsion is strong, and the final paragraph's rhythm effectively supports the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor deduction for a cluster of slightly abstract phrases in a high-pressure beat ("the ache now transformed into belonging," "the luminescent ache now a beacon") which slightly dull the immediacy of the closure image, triggering a small artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating toward climax. Figurative language ("time as clay, not river") enhances without muddling. One minor artifact: "uncape" may be a typo for "uncage," but it's consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, supporting the accumulative drive. A single minor artifact: the phrase "emotion was not chaos but geometry" edges toward declarative summary in a peak beat, though it is immediately grounded in the concrete image of the drop. Otherwise, the line-level craft is flawless and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, there is slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., “painting the dust motes... with a fragile, quiet light”) that, while beautiful, occasionally approaches ornamentation. No loops or scaffolds, and clarity remains intact, but the slight overload prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor instance of potential overwriting exists (“incandescent restraint” appears twice), creating a slight echo, but it does not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with excellent information density. A minor prose artifact appears in the phrase "palimpsests of lives," which introduces a slightly academic register dissonant with Elias's embodied, tactile lexicon. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly efficient, with virtually no scaffolding or loops. Figurative language ("lovingly venomous," "mournful elation") is precise, taught, and pays off. A single, very minor instance of potential synonym churn ("brittle shroud" / "frozen earth") in the opening line prevents a perfect score, but it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor deduction for occasional figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "the tide pools emptying like spent tears" risks slight abstraction early on), but clarity and momentum are never sacrificed, and the closure image lands with power.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.6)

The final paragraph achieves perfect cadence and clarity, landing the closure image without obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly figurative, with excellent rhythm and syntactic variety. However, occasional density in figurative language (“foxglove regret thick as the library’s dust—sweetly poisonous”) slightly obscures momentum in peak beats, though clarity at closure remains intact. No loops or scaffold; information density is high, and every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Minor register drift in emotional labels prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density ("iridescent squid-ink," "glyphs sharp as shattered glass"). Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs. Minor figurative muddle in "carefully reckless energy" slightly disrupts peak pressure. One paraphrase loop ("trust, once broken, requires delicate hands to restore") triggers a small deduction, but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful detail. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the final paragraph ("dappled resolve," "light and shadow"), which, while beautiful, edges toward ornamentation in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are excellent, with no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the final paragraph ("blooming gold"), which, while beautiful, approaches ornamentation in a peak beat without fully obscuring the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is largely coherent and purposeful, though there is a minor tendency toward stacked images in some beats ("fractured hush settled over the drifting prism terrace like powdered glass") that, while voice-motivated, slightly tests the line of overwriting without crossing it. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with excellent rhythmic variety and information density. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the peak beat ("shadowseam wonder where light fractured into ghostly spectrums"), which creates a momentary drag on momentum. Otherwise, line-level craft is exceptional and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor figurative overload occurs in high-pressure beats (e.g., "seeds scattered like fallen stars, rolling into crevices where light pooled" followed by more metaphor). This creates a slight drag on momentum without obscuring closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density ("a symphony born of tidal math"). Rhythm varies effectively with the scene's tempo.

However, this does not obscure closure, and the language is otherwise precise, vivid, and devoid of loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("serene upheaval defined this place" slightly repetitive). No loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language remains coherent and voice-motivated. Closure image remains clear and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong rhythmic control and information density. A minor instance of potential overwriting occurs in the peak beat: "the guilt of knowing and failing to act" edges toward thematic statement but is immediately anchored by the subsequent, more embodied line about the resonator spiking. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure clarity. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, and the final line is a masterful resolution that recharges the central motif.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot; there is zero scaffolding or looped phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. However, a template cadence emerges in adjacent sentences starting with "The slow dance of celestial bodies" and "The terrace, overlooking the scarred valley," creating a minor rhythmic loop. Figurative language is generally effective, but the "midsummer moth" simile feels slightly decorative under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the opening paragraph ("crunching like shattered glass," "blinding expanse of white"), though it is pattern-taught and does not obscure closure. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold; propulsion is clear and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures accelerating tension. Minor artifacting: "weaponized grace" leans slightly abstract, and "living sonnet" is a mixed metaphor. However, clarity and propulsion are maintained, especially in the closure beat.

Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional, with clear propulsion and no loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong information density. However, slight overwriting is present in some figurative language (e.g., "weaving nonviolent solutions from spider-silk diplomacy") which, while beautiful, slightly slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the climax ("a visible wave of absolute silence, cool and pure as mountain air"), which slightly softens the impact of the decisive moment. Otherwise, clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and strong rhythmic control. A minor register drift occurs in the high-pressure climax ("universe was answering"), leaning slightly toward declarative theme statement, but it does not obscure closure clarity or cause significant artifact issues.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and purposeful sensory detail. Rhythm is masterfully controlled, accelerating and breathing with the scene. A minor deduction for a moment of potential density in the memory montage ("children laughing... warriors falling..."), which, while beautiful, borders on a list-like transition in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, often doing multiple jobs (e.g., "dusk bled into the fortress walls" establishes time, mood, and the setting's nature). Rhythm is varied and purposeful, accelerating with discovery. A minor, hairline slip exists: the phrase "a designer adrift" is slightly summary-like, but it is immediately anchored by the concrete tragedy and does not harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly accomplished with strong rhythmic control and information density. However, a minor artifact is present: a slight over-reliance on figurative language in the high-pressure beat describing the droplet ("refracting the distant stars into a thousand fractured points of light"). While beautiful, this creates a minor density spike that slightly obscures the immediate causal clarity of the realization, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the peak beat ("intangibly tangible as breath against glass yet dense enough to anchor a falling star"), where figurative language stacks and risks muddling coherence under pressure. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat: "a vaulting hush pressing against the crystal facets" slightly stacks figurative language. However, rhythm is masterful, and no loops or artifacts obscure the closure's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is generally superb with high density and varied rhythm. A minor deduction for occasional over-writing and a synonym loop ("fractured light"/"fractured crimson heart"/"light fractured"). These artifacts are minor and do not touch the closure, but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor deduction for a subtle paraphrase loop ("ashen charcoal sanctuary" repeated in the first and final paragraphs) slightly dulls the closure image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly dense and propulsive, doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. The read-aloud rhythm is excellent.

    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong sentence-level propulsion (“A sound like tearing silk…”). Minimal scaffolding; one minor loop in “possibility”/“potential” usage, but no figurative muddle or clarity loss in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, as with the dust motes. Sentences vary rhythmically to accelerate and breathe with the scene's needs. A single, minor scaffold phrase ("her motivation crystallized") slightly disrupts the otherwise impeccable line-level craft, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is highly concise and vivid, with excellent rhythmic control and information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without scaffold or loops. Figurative language ("liquid starlight") is purposeful and legible, especially in the peak closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet clear, with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating toward the climax. No loops or artifacts; figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful, enhancing without obscuring.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly skilled, with excellent rhythm and information density. It narrowly avoids overwriting, but a tendency toward figurative density in high-pressure beats ("Hope, fragile as a seedling, bloomed in her chest") creates a minor, consistent artifact that slightly dulls immediacy. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold. High information density with clear propulsion; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("buildings reduced to charcoal husks"). Syntax and rhythm accelerate and breathe in step with scene needs.

Otherwise, the prose is free of loops, scaffold, and figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language ("like holding smoke") is purposeful and coherent. Minor deduction for "weightless burden" bordering on abstract label, but it's quickly embodied. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; rhythm supports tension throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, though occasionally over-written ("susanration" repeats; "negotiable reality" appears twice). Figurative language is generally coherent and purposeful. One minor paraphrase loop: "destabilizing" used frequently around the whisper's action.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Exceptionally high information density and propulsion, though a minor register drift occurs in the phrase "poetic soul drowned in burnished sorrow," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon in an introductory beat. No artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and dense, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts are present, including a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "ghosts of melodies," "thrummed") and a template cadence in the opening sentence structure. However, these do not measurably obscure cause/effect or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid with high information economy. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("hinged awakenings snapped into motion"), and rhythm modulates effectively to support pressure. No loops or artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density with mostly clear propulsion. Minor template cadence appears in three consecutive "she would" sentences near the end, creating a slight rhythmic pattern. No figurative muddle in peak beats, and closure remains unaffected.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and poetic but maintains clarity and momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and supports pressure ("dawning hush pressing around her like a velvet glove"). No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Rhythm varies naturally, though occasional complex syntax may slightly slow readability.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly atmospheric with strong momentum. Minor deductions for occasional dense figurative clusters ("a vast mirror of cooled volcanic glass buried deep within the shifting dunes, reflected the bruised twilight sky like a wound in the earth") that, while beautiful, slightly slow the initial orientation. Otherwise, line-level craft is exceptional and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor instance of potential overwriting exists in the phrase "a network of trust, not magic, where sorrow was acknowledged but not escaped," which edges toward thematic statement. This is a hairline slip in an otherwise flawlessly propelled narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical with excellent rhythmic control. Minor figurative strain in "blood turned to ice" slightly reduces clarity in a peak beat. Otherwise, information density is high, propulsion is strong, and there are no loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished and vivid, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some sentences (e.g., "a cathedral of frozen silence") and a near-paraphrase loop between "frozen silence" and "icebound atrium." These do not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and rhythmic control. One slight overwrite exists in "a lesson etched deeper than any siren's echo," which leans toward thematic statement, but it is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure. Otherwise, the language is precise, propulsive, and free of loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control that accelerates and breathes with the scene. There is no scaffolding, synonym churn, or figurative muddle. A single, minor paraphrase loop occurs in the first paragraph ("dusting the relics" / "cooled ash of dead stars"), but it does not obscure closure or causality. The final image is crystal clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight density in the opening paragraph, where figurative language is stacked ("skeletal remains," "translucent figures," "silent mouths"), creating a momentary deceleration before the pattern is fully taught.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with high information density. However, minor text artifacts appear, including a template cadence ("She lifted it... Suddenly timeless...") and a slight synonym churn ("anticipated mysteries," "ready to bloom"). These do not obscure closure but slightly dull the peak beat's immediacy, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, minor overwriting exists in peak beats (e.g., "a burnished hush restored, deeper for the rupture it had endured" verges on synonym churn). A single, slight figurative density in the closure paragraph prevents a higher score, though it does not obscure clarity or cause significant momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic ("copper wire, thin and pliable, coiled in his palm like a promise"). Figurative language serves character and pressure. One minor loop: "brazen calm" repeats three times, slightly ornamental but pattern-taught. No artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly efficient, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "Bronze quiet settled over the tower grounds" establishes atmosphere, tone, and time). Momentum is unwavering. A minor deduction for a few instances of adjective stacking ("rainwashed," "spring," "limestone") in the opening line that slightly delays propulsion, though the description is purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains clarity and momentum, with high information density (e.g., "submerged concord" doing multiple jobs). Minor figurative strain in "narrow vastness" slightly muddles sense but does not harm closure. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence-level propulsion is strong, though a few complex sentences may benefit from tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slightly mixed metaphor in a peak beat ("Hope, sharp and sudden, flared in his chest" juxtaposes tactile "sharp" with visual "flared"), but it does not obscure closure. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for the slightly repetitive use of "echoed silence" and the phrase "temporally stretched" which appears multiple times. However, these are minor and do not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly crafted with vivid, specific nouns and strong verbs. Rhythm is controlled and varies with scene needs, though one paragraph ("He lifted the Black King...") has a slight template cadence. Information density is high; most sentences advance multiple elements. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains propulsion and clarity. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "luminous absence felt suffocating"), though it remains coherent and voice-motivated. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold, with high information density and clean syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor instance of stacked modifiers ("cold and unyielding, speaking only in silent, alien curves") slightly dulls a peak beat, but this is a hairline slip that does not harm closure. Otherwise, the line-level craft is flawless, with zero loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for occasional figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "the woven hush deepened, pressing against her like a physical weight"), which, while purposeful, slightly risks obscuring immediacy. However, there are no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors, and clarity is maintained through the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and purposeful, vivid imagery. There is a minor tendency toward dense figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "forged hush," "trapped ghosts"), which slightly obscures immediacy without breaking clarity. Rhythm and syntax are otherwise well-controlled and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly evocative and dense, with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight instance of overwriting ("a symphony of straining brass and failing pistons") which, while voice-consistent, slightly slows the high-pressure beat. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor artifact appears in the peak beat: the slightly stacked metaphor in "a letting go that felt like coming home" and the abstract "quiet truth of a vow kept" create a small figurative muddle amidst an otherwise concrete and embodied climax. This prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied syntax and rhythm. Figurative language ("screaming tenderness") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. No loops, scaffolding, or register drift. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements (character, atmosphere, plot).

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. A minor template cadence appears in the second paragraph ("They worked until dawn... By the second night..."), but it does not obscure closure. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, supporting pressure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong sensory specificity ("oilskin cloak," "storm-scoured cliffs"). A minor scaffold artifact exists in "Psychological safety wasn’t silence; it was the space..." which slightly explains the already dramatized theme. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere without redundancy or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with vivid, concrete imagery and strong rhythmic variation. Minor density issues appear in phrases like "witnessed isolation" which edges toward label-speak, but this is a hairline slip that does not harm closure. Information density is high, and sentences advance multiple elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and atmospheric but controlled, with high information density. Minor deduct for a slight register elevation in "profound clarity" and a near-paraphrase loop between "lingering promise" and "cartographic imperative."

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly evocative and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a cluster of complex metaphors in the climax ("lacy menace," "crystalline poison," "liquid light") that, while purposeful, slightly risk muddying the immediate clarity of the physical threat and action at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor figurative strain appears in the peak beat ("translating human sorrow into silent frequency") but does not obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with scene needs without becoming sluggish.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely artifact-free, with high information density. The sentence-level propulsion is excellent, accelerating toward the climax. A minor deduction is applied for the repeated phrase "wanderingly exact," which creates a slight template cadence, and for the compound adjective "wanderingly-exact" which feels slightly overworked.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is highly vivid and concise, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor instance of near-abstract phrasing ("tension between now and now") is quickly grounded by concrete image ("razor edges where moments bled"). No loops or scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor deduction for a subtle paraphrase loop: "quiet wildfire" is used three times, slightly dulling its impact. The closure beat, however, remains clear and unaffected by this minor artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong rhythm, though "clover melancholy" is a slightly strained metaphor. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., the lantern description establishes object, mood, and motive). No significant loops or artifacts obscure closure; the final paragraph lands with clarity and charge.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "melodically haunted" leans slightly toward tell-y labeling in a peak beat, though it is quickly dramatized. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold, and figurative language is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and information density. Minor risk of overwriting in peak beats ("haunted euphoria" slightly leans diagnostic), but clarity remains. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "fragile as dandelion fluff," "raw ache beneath") which, while voice-motivated, slightly risks density. However, it never obscures clarity or causality, and the closure image remains sharp and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.6)
    Exemplary line-level craft with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("stars bleeding into motion") is precise and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the phrase "thresh meaning from the bitter harvest of experience," which momentarily leans abstract, and a template cadence in "She wrote sparingly... She focused..." However, these are minor and do not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat ("Joy flooded Elara, fierce and bright, yet tangled with sorrow"), which leans slightly toward diagnostic label-speak. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; rhythm and syntax are masterfully controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally concise and vivid, with strong information density. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "volcanic tenderness" is repeated and feels slightly overworked, creating a small loop that dulls the peak moment. Otherwise, sentence-level propulsion is excellent, and the final paragraph's rhythm is particularly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly purposeful, with varied syntax and rhythm that accelerate with the scene. A minor figurative muddle occurs near the climax ("auric light flickered violently; the lagoon’s surface rippled with static"), slightly blending metaphorical and literal registers and creating a moment of opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero scaffolding or loops. Figurative language ("metal skins vibrating like colossal tuning forks") is vivid, purposeful, and consistent. Sentence-level rhythm varies expertly to match the tension of the navigation. The read-aloud test would be superb.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with every sentence advancing atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language ("a deep, slow current beneath the surface") is cohesive and enhances clarity. Rhythm is varied and masterfully controlled, accelerating with the shutter movements and slowing in reflective moments. There are no loops, artifacts, or clarity issues, even at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a cluster of figurative language in the opening beat ("like ink in water," "symphony of doubt") which, while beautiful, slightly delays narrative momentum without a clear pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. There is a minor tendency toward figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a sigh made visible," "combative tenderness"), but it remains coherent and serves the accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose is polished with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, with clarity and concision even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and poetic, with high information density. However, it occasionally trends toward overwriting; figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats without a clear pattern-teaching payoff, creating a slight muddle. A run of similar sentence structures in the climax ("She began to paraphrase...", "This was her method...") creates a minor template cadence, slightly dulling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied rhythm and sentence structures. Figurative language ("a world washed clean but not yet understood") is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops or scaffold; clarity and momentum are maintained through peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and clear propulsion. Figurative language ("sonic fossils," "embers") enhances without muddling. One minor loop: "powerfully gentle" appears twice, but it's pattern-taught and charged at closure. No artifacts harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax that accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs. However, a minor instance of thesaurus-churn is detected in “顽强 life” (where the Chinese character for "tenacious" is an unwarranted lexical intrusion for this POV and context), and a single filter verb stack (“She watched... tears tracing”) slightly dulls immediacy at the peak closure beat. These are minor artifacts that do not obscure cause and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms. A minor register drift occurs with "cartographic endeavor," slightly elevating diction beyond the established voice, but it does not harm clarity. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exemplary, with no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is lush and highly specific with excellent rhythmic control. However, a template cadence emerges in a cluster of sentences using "that" clauses ("the idea that...", "the fact that...", "knowing that..."), applying a -0.4 deduction. This minor artifact does not touch the closure beat but slightly dulls the immediacy of the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor tendency toward slightly over-stacked figurative language in high-pressure beats ("luminous regret settling deep within her bones") prevents a higher score, though clarity is never lost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.3)
    Line-level craft is exceptional. Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive without a single loop or scaffold artifact. Figurative language ("scent of damp cedar and starlight," "fractured emeralds") is precise, consistent, and heightens clarity. The read-aloud rhythm is masterful, varying sentence structure to mirror the pacing of observation and action. A minuscule deduction for the slightly heavy "self-respect meant..." line, but it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a perfect meteor hush settling over the cliffs") creating a slight drag, but clarity and momentum are maintained.

    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without artifacts. Figurative language ("pulsing like a heartbeat") is pattern-taught and supports clarity. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; peak beats maintain legibility under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly evocative with strong read-aloud quality. Minor figurative muddle in "shadowed rapture" (beauty is "ecstatic, yet layered with... melancholy" slightly strains the vehicle) prevents a higher score. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold; high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a cluster of figurative language in the archive description paragraph ("wave functions of probability," "map of roads that never were") which, while beautiful, creates a slight density spike that momentarily slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is largely effective and coherent, though it approaches density in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "scattered her journey like seeds on the wind"). No loops or scaffold artifacts. A minor deduction for this slight overwriting tendency, which does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. A slight figurative density appears in clusters like "heart beat a shoreline lullaby" followed by "wood creaking like a lullaby," creating a mild repetitive stem. However, this patterning is intentional and pays off in the final "shoreline lullaby of waves," charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. Minor overwriting in phrases like “seraphically mundane” slightly inflates texture without advancing sense, but clarity and propulsion are maintained. No loops or scaffolding artifacts; figurative language is generally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph's cadence is particularly effective, bringing the story to a resonant close.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is minimal scaffolding or looped phrasing. A slight register elevation in "etched not in policy but in the bones of the earth" is voice-motivated and serves the conceptual repricing, causing no clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences ("The mess of broken ships and shattered hopes wasn’t chaos; it was fertile ground") but does not obscure closure. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, though near-paraphrase loops slightly dull momentum in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("spectral hands") is pattern-taught and pays off. Rhythm varies naturally with sentence length, accelerating toward climax. Minor overwriting in peak beats does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. One minor artifact: the phrase "kaleidoscope of shattering glass and lace" risks slight decorative flourish in a high-pressure beat, but it is brief and does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor hairline slip: a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "scattered bones," "spider-silk") creates a patterned density that, while taught, borders on overwhelming but does not obscure closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with excellent rhythmic control and information density. A slight figurative density in the climax ("a glacier calving within her chest") creates a minor, momentary coherence check, but it does not obscure the closure's clarity or impact.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally crisp and propulsive, with high information density. A minor loop exists with the phrase "dizzying quiet" repeated, but it functions as a deliberate motif. The sentence-level rhythm effectively accelerates tension, particularly during the upload sequence. No figurative muddle or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery ("glowing like embers").

No artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm and variation. However, minor figurative strain occurs in the high-pressure beat ("shards of shattered sound that hung like glass" slightly mixes metaphor). Information density is high, and propulsion is maintained, but this prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is generally exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor artifact exists: the phrase "orbits of regret" is a mixed metaphor (regret doesn't have orbits) that slightly muddles sense in an otherwise precise opening. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure causality or dull the closure image, but it prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly atmospheric, with excellent rhythmic control. There is a minor instance of potential register drift in the opening lines with "cosmic impact" and "profound silence," but it is brief. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional, with clarity and momentum maintained even through complex figurative language. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong sensory verbs ("clung," "muffling," "pulsed"). Rhythm is varied and purposeful, accelerating with pressure. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the phrase "lilac unease," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon, though it is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops, scaffolds, or clarity issues harm the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, though a slight over-reliance on compound-complex sentences creates a minor, consistent cadence in high-pressure beats ("Kael gasped, back in the cold plaza..."). No loops or artifacts obscure closure; information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific diction. Information density is high, with sentences performing multiple jobs. A minor issue is a cluster of complex figurative language in the peak beat of the weave ("the smell of burnt wiring mixed with night-blooming jasmine..."), which creates a slight density artifact but does not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and vivid imagery. A minor deduction for occasional moments of overwriting or slightly muddled metaphor (e.g., "fractally precise paths that seemed to pulse with inner life" introduces a slightly mixed image). The sentence-level propulsion is excellent, carrying the reader through complex ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and zero artifacts. Sentences are propulsive and varied, doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously.

The line-level craft supports the accumulative pressure and clarity of the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and virtually free of artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("phototropic to kindness"). One minor rhythm stumble in the long sentence beginning "He saw flashes," but it serves the accumulative effect. Read-aloud quality is high.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic variety. A single minor flaw prevents a higher score: the phrase "protected vulnerability" in the final third feels slightly thematic-echo-ish, though it is quickly redeemed by concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language ("clouds swirled like restless oceans") is pattern-taught and supports pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and vivid, specific imagery. A minor register drift occurs in the phrase "ethereal grit," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon in a peak beat, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely devoid of scaffolding. A slight tendency toward overwriting appears in peak beats (e.g., "hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird"), with a few stacked modifiers, but clarity and momentum are never lost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high. One minor flaw: the metaphor "lanced the silence" is slightly mixed (a blade lances, but silence is not a boil). This is a hairline slip that does not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and dense, doing multiple jobs of advancing character, atmosphere, and plot. The rhythm is controlled and purposeful. A minor artifact penalty is applied for the repetition of "spongey dread" and the slightly overused "nervously confident" label, which creates a minor loop and prevents a higher score. Otherwise, line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density with clear propulsion; figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("luminous disbelief," "pixelated amnesty"). No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with scene needs, though minor register elevation exists ("luminous glyph").

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful metaphors ("rust like cold sweat," "slow, suffocating suffusion of doubt").

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly figurative, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally flirts with over-writing; the phrase "futures unborn yet aching to be" is slightly abstract and less immediate than the concrete, embodied language surrounding it. This minor artifact prevents a higher score, though it does not obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion and information density are otherwise exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and virtually no scaffolding or loops. A minor deduction for occasional over-dense metaphor stacks ("a hole in the soul of the world") that momentarily risk clarity but do not harm closure. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and information density. A minor instance of repetitive stems ("echo valley longing... The quarry's emptiness held a new potential, a space waiting for the next note") slightly dulls the final image's clarity, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward overwriting in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "mist curling around her ankles like liquid smoke" followed by "breath fogged the delicate lace"), creating a momentary density of figurative language that slightly slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and dense, doing multiple jobs ("mulberry ache," "liquid silver"). There is a tendency toward slight overwriting in a few phrases (e.g., "a weight deeper than the humid midsummer night outside"), creating minor momentum drag. However, the line-level craft is largely exceptional, with strong rhythm and no confusing artifacts, especially in the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without losing clarity or momentum. Figurative language (“aurora bled emerald,” “heartbeat underwater”) is consistent and purposeful, avoiding mixed metaphors. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, accelerating with urgency during the infusion. Zero loops, scaffold, or artifactual phrasing; every line advances story, character, or atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm is natural and varied.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with varied rhythm and sentence openings, achieving density without padding. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though the phrase "vineyard hush" risks slight mixed metaphor (grotto/vineyard). Momentum is maintained through strong verbs and integrated description. A single near-paraphrase loop ("contentment remained elusive" / "peace feel so distant") slightly dulls the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor overwriting in phrases like "sincerely insincere" slightly strains coherence but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative stacking in the opening paragraph ("misting hush... fine dust"), though it remains coherent and voice-motivated. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. Minor density issue: the climactic sentence ("Shelves glowed faintly...") stacks figurative language, slightly blurring the immediate clarity of the closure image without breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. A slight overwriting tendency exists in stacked modifiers (e.g., "luminous, cerulean, ochre, and crimson"), creating minor density in a high-pressure beat, but clarity and propulsion are never harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally high-caliber with strong rhythm and information density. However, a -0.5 deduction is applied for a patterned artifact: a run of dense figurative language in the high-pressure disorientation beat ("swirling nebulas," "river of time") that, while beautiful, slightly risks obscuring immediate clarity and represents a minor instance of overwriting under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly evocative and dense with purpose, though slightly over-written in a few high-pressure beats ("constellations should have been visible—Orion’s belt, Cassiopeia’s chair").

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    High information density with clear propulsion; prose is concise and vivid. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. A single, minor paraphrase loop exists ("true release required understanding the precise point... where holding on ceased to honor"), but it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few phrases ("driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder") which, while voice-consistent, approach decorative density in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propelled, with high information density and zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats ("sand crumbling like stale bread"). Rhythm supports the emotional cadence without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor artifacts include a slight thesaurus-churn feel in phrases like "basso profundo yearning" and a template cadence in "vibrant and connected, the vigorous tender pulse." These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score. Information density is excellent, with most sentences advancing multiple elements.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor artifacting: repetitive use of "quaking reverie" (three times) and the stem "chaotically precise" (twice) creates a slight template cadence. However, the rhythm is strong and the closure image remains clear and unaffected by these minor flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is highly crafted with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, a tendency toward slightly overwrought phrasing ("clandestinely luminous," "latent blaze of ancient purpose") and a minor synonym loop ("vigilance," "seeds," "blaze") creates occasional textural artifacts that prevent a higher score, though they do not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor overwriting tendency appears in the climax ("weeping, laughing, and gasping all at once"), creating a slight figurative stack that slightly dulls clarity, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("He closed his eyes, pressing the worry stone...a reminder of his own imperfections").

Read-aloud rhythm is excellent, varying naturally with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. However, slight overwriting appears in the peak beat ("a silence of withheld forgiveness," "silence of fleeting courage"), applying figurative language in a cluster that slightly softens the immediate clarity of the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent information density. A minor deduction for occasional dense phrasing ("olfactorily sensitive nose") that slightly disrupts rhythm, but these are isolated and do not obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly evocative, with strong rhythmic control. However, slight overwriting occurs in the peak beat with phrases like "undeniable and vital, a symptom of the resilience she sought," which summarizes a shown moment. This minor artifact prevents a top-tier score, though clarity and momentum are never lost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight template cadence in a high-pressure beat ("Adapting rapidly, she recalibrated...") and a single instance of potential register drift ("lethal funnel"). No artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but generally controlled, with high information density and purposeful sensory detail. A slight tendency toward synonym churn ("oscillating repose" repeated) and a few abstract nouns in the final reflective beats ("humanity was a hollow shell") prevent a higher score, though clarity is never harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("pressing down like a physical weight") is pattern-taught and payoff-linked. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. One minor artifact: "avalanchingly quiet" is a bold coinage that risks obscurity but serves the accumulative design and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (e.g., "grief is a silent tide"). Minor artifact: a slight over-reliance on compound descriptors in early sentences ("cryptic letterpress operator," "indigo ink"), but this does not obscure closure or cause significant propulsion loss.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied syntax that accelerates and breathes with the scene. A minor instance of potential overwriting ("frozen river of ghostly light") is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity. The closure image is sharp and unmarred by figurative muddle or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("mist curling like spectral fingers") is purposeful and coherent. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in the peak beat. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating with the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated. Minor scaffold in adjacent sentences ("The loom sang... She felt the separation") causes a slight paraphrase loop, but clarity at closure is unharmed. Read-aloud ear test is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "profoundly alien" sensation description). No loops or scaffolds; clarity and momentum are maintained through the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing multiple jobs ("Dust motes danced... each particle humming with residual chroniton decay"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with pressure. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. There is a minor tendency toward figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "the luminescent ache settled in her chest—a soft, blue sorrow"), but it is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative mode. Sentences advance multiple jobs of character, setting, and theme. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with excellent information density. Minor deduction for a slight figurative pile-up in the climax ("dance of darkness and radiance"), which momentarily risks clarity. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold, and syntax accelerates with the storm's intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs with "valley-mist wonder," which slightly blurs sense as an abstract-noun compound. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure beat. Otherwise, the writing is concise, vivid, and propulsive, with sentences that advance multiple layers of story and character without scaffold or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high information density with clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "brass limbs splayed like a dead insect." Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with discovery. The final paragraph's cadence shift supports the conceptual repricing without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language ("like golden thread through dark cloth") is purposeful and coherent. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with her panic and finding a new cadence with the singing.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor artifact: the phrase "enlarged tranquility" feels slightly overwritten and register-drifted for the POV's lexicon in a peak beat. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and vivid, advancing character and atmosphere simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor instance of potential overwriting ("fiercely ordinary") slightly dulls the closure's edge, preventing a higher score. Otherwise, the language is precise, vivid, and propulsive, with no loops, artifacts, or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "needles trembling like spider legs"), which, while beautiful, creates a mild density artifact without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density ("comforting unease settling over the illicit stalls"). No loops or scaffolding; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated ("sunrise painted the sky in bruised oranges"). Syntax varies naturally, with rhythmic control in peaks. Read-aloud test passes smoothly; no artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor instance of potential overwriting exists in the cluster of figurative language describing the carriers' approach ("microclimate of her own making," "shimmered the aurora's light," "swirling cherry blossoms"), which slightly slows the high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("Bioluminescent quartz veins pulsed with a soft, auroral sorrow"). Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs, accelerating in discovery beats. Minor artifact: "mnemonically gifted" is slightly diagnostic but is immediately dramatized in the next clause. No loops or scaffolding; figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong verbs ("traced," "hammering"). Figurative language is mostly effective, though "magnetic pollen" feels slightly forced. No loops or scaffolding; closure image is clear. Minor overwriting in "sun-scorched celery" metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is luminous and virtually flawless. Sentence-level rhythm is masterful, varying naturally to accelerate and breathe with the scene. Information density is extremely high, with nearly every line doing multiple jobs of advancing story, character, and atmosphere. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. A single, minuscule deduction for the slightly elevated register of "kinetic sculpture," which feels slightly external to Elara's otherwise perfectly embodied lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("nostalgia clung to him like desert dust"). There are no observable loops, scaffold, or artifacts that obscure causality or dull the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing character or plot. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in a few spots (e.g., "sandstorm calm," "gritty sigh") which, while evocative, momentarily slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with excellent information density. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the phrase "the lyrical code breaker," which feels slightly label-like, though it is quickly anchored by concrete action. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "gleaming silence" anchors tone, setting, and theme). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with discovery and breathing at closure. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles; every image advances the story. A single minor filter verb cluster ("he realized") prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly dense, with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a subtle paraphrase loop: "terrestrially cosmic" is used three times, and while the first two are effective, the final use feels slightly repetitive. Otherwise, figurative language is coherent and advances the atmosphere without muddling sense.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing propulsion or clarity. Figurative language ("meteors flaring like dying stars") is purposeful and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control, though it occasionally borders on overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "resonance structures inexplicably harmonizing with her fractured psyche"). There is a minor instance of synonym churn ("quarantined memory" is used repeatedly). Overall, clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, though slightly overwritten in places ("pearl twilight" repeated). No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor register drift in "wisely enduring" but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is highly textured and vivid, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally trends toward overwriting; a cluster of figurative language in adjacent sentences ("reed-blown melancholy," "thin and aching as a flute’s last note," "constellations might betray them") creates a slight density artifact that momentarily obscures clarity. The artifact does not touch the closure beat, but it slightly dulls momentum in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.5)
    Line-level craft is exceptional. The prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. Sentences like "windows of connection holding fast against the dark" do multiple jobs, advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly polished with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifact: the phrase "scintillatingly somber" feels slightly over-engineered and register-drifted for Kenji's voice, creating a tiny stumble in an otherwise flawless peak beat. This prevents a higher score, but the line-level craft is otherwise exemplary, with high density and zero loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propelled by strong verbs and specific nouns. Rhythm varies naturally with the scene's needs. Information density is high without feeling overwritten. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with strong rhythm and varied sentence openings. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("jagged lightning illuminated... like a crown of broken teeth" slightly decorative) prevents a higher score. No loops or scaffolding; clarity and propulsion are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without artifice, advancing story and atmosphere ("gleaned redemption... was this – a single, salvaged note"). Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with discovery and breathing in reflective moments. No loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with strong information density. Minor artifact penalty (-0.2) for a slight template cadence in the climax ("He adjusted... he held") and one potentially mixed metaphor ("flapping like a wounded bird").

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Generally excellent prose with high information density. Minor figurative density in climax ("ice sang with tension") slightly obscures cause-effect but doesn't harm closure. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythm and varied sentence structures. Minor overwriting in "phantom chill of a different night" slightly blurs peak clarity. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements (plot, character, theme). No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly concise and vivid, with excellent rhythmic control and information density. One minor deduction for a slightly abstract phrase ("a promise kept") in the final third, which slightly dulls the concrete charge of the ticking heart. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere without scaffold or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high information density with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language ("data streams," "probability trees") serves pattern-building without muddle. Rhythm varies naturally, though minor strain in "swirling acid became data streams" slightly reduces clarity. No loops or artifacts; sentence-level propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is concise, vivid, and highly propulsive, with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("the archive hummed on, ready to swallow its next victim in silence"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. A single instance of near-duplicate phrasing ("sensed absence") is minor and does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, but minor density issues appear in the vintage store sequence ("its surface rippling like disturbed water..."). A single paraphrase loop exists ("reconstitute... reconstituted"). However, the closure beat is clean and powerful, with no artifacts obscuring the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic without artifacts. Figurative language is pattern-taught ("windborne solace") and pays off at closure. Sentences vary structure to match urgency. No loops or scaffolding. Peak beats maintain clarity despite lyrical density ("high, pure vibration in the ice").

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and clear propulsion. However, a minor artifact exists: a slight register drift in the phrase "nurture intersubjective understanding" feels tonally academic for Elara's internal voice at peak pressure. This is a hairline slip that does not touch closure, but prevents a 9+ score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor artifact occurs in a high-pressure beat: the double "strangely honest" mention ("strangely honest eyes," "strangely honest nature") creates a slight paraphrase loop. This does not obscure closure but prevents a higher score. Otherwise, sentence-level propulsion and clarity are exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a slight density risk emerges in the peak beat describing the photographs ("water streaking like rain," "joy arcing"), applying a small penalty for figurative clustering under pressure. The propulsion and clarity remain superb, and the closure is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with excellent rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a potentially mixed metaphor ("pulse with unspoken words" following "tomb") and a slight risk of ornamental density in peak beats, though clarity is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly evocative and dense, though minor artifacting occurs in peak beats with slightly over-stacked metaphors ("precognitively forgetful, knowing tomorrows that dissolved like salt"). Rhythm and syntax are otherwise expertly controlled to accelerate and breathe with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the climax ("pierced Aris’s despair with crystalline clarity") which introduces a slightly elevated register. No loops or scaffolds; clarity and propulsion are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design, though a minor deduction for slight over-density in the opening sentence ("the scent of hope clinging to her like the lingering trace of rain on sun-warmed stone"). Read-aloud rhythm is masterful, with syntactic variety supporting emotional beats. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in the peak closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly purposeful, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. A minor deduction for occasional dense phrasing (e.g., "lingering residue of the Spoon-Bending") that slightly slows momentum, but clarity and propulsion are maintained, especially in the crucial closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A minor scaffold phrase ("exactly, she thought") appears once, but it does not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image. No figurative muddle or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control that accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs. There is a minor instance of potential register drift in "reflectively vibrant as crushed emeralds kissed by moonbeams," which slightly clashes with the POV's lexicon, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences performing multiple jobs. A minor -0.1 deduction for figurative density in the opening paragraph ("honeyed hush," "cooled syrup," "lullaby of safety") which slightly slows initial momentum but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight density of figurative language in the climax ("liquid stars," "spider silk") which, while beautiful, creates a minor artifact in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("spinning golden stories from pure resonance") creates a slight figurative muddle, but clarity remains. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Information density is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variety. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "moving stillness" is repeated, slightly dulling its impact. However, this does not obscure cause/effect or harm the closure image, and the overall execution is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("gears like frozen leaves") is purposeful and consistent. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the discovery and decelerates into the resonant closure, perfectly matching scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though the phrase "whalebone reverie" risks obscurity. There are no synonym loops or scaffold sentences. The final paragraph's cadence masterfully supports the closure image. A single minor artifact ("whalebone reverie") prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is vivid and economical with high information density. A minor template cadence and a slight paraphrase loop ("contain the storm... shape sorrow") in the peak beat prevent a higher score, but clarity and momentum are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. A minor deduction for a slight pattern of "fractured" and "broken" imagery, which, while thematically relevant, creates a subtle repetitive stem. However, this does not obscure closure, and the final paragraph's propulsion is flawless and devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. A single, minor artifact is detected: a near-paraphrase loop between "redirecting what remained toward what could be" and the earlier concept of "redirected flows," which slightly dulls the final image's edge. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are superb.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density. Minor artifacts: repetition of "excruciatingly gentle" and "glacial hush" borders on template cadence but serves pattern payoff. Rhythm supports accumulative pressure without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Prose is concise and propulsive, advancing story and character simultaneously. A single, minor artifact exists: the phrase "thoughtfully clear precision" in the climax has a slight synonym-loop quality, but it does not measurably obscure the closure or cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (e.g., "fossilized storm holding back the dark"), but no loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence-level syntax accelerates with scene needs. Figurative language is generally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a single, minor instance of potential overwriting in the description of the thread ("vein of frozen blood"), which slightly risks cliché, but it is brief and does not harm clarity or momentum. The prose is otherwise flawless, propulsive, and free of artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely exceptional with high information density and rhythmic control. A −0.6 deduction is applied for a template-cadence run and minor figurative muddle in the climax ("bittersweet tang of ozone and crushed moss filling his mouth – the bittersweet promise..."). This artifact slightly dulls the clarity of the closure beat but does not break it.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    Exquisite line-level craft with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor deduction for slight figurative density in one paragraph ("cold and fine as ground starlight" slightly decorative). No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues; propulsion is maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "sidereal patience" appears twice, "defiant hush" three times), creating a subtle pattern of repetition that slightly dulls the immediacy of the closure image, though clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush and highly figurative but purposeful, advancing atmosphere and character. A minor deduction for the repeated phrase "across the quiet sigh of falling petals," which creates a slight paraphrase loop. However, the language is otherwise precise and propulsive, with high information density and no clarity issues in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is densely poetic but maintains propulsion, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("their wings folded like tiny stained-glass windows" combines image, theme, and setting). Minor figurative density in peak beats ("thundering calm") slightly risks obscuring clarity, but the closure image remains sharp. No loops or scaffolding; every line advances the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, though slightly overstacked in phrases like "frozen midnight" and "ink-black waves." A minor template cadence appears in the climax ("He saw the rake’s tines..."), but it does not obscure closure. Overall, line-level craft supports the accumulative texture without significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("drink the starlight") is pattern-taught and purposeful. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally. One minor artifact: "velveteen gloom" repeats, but it reinforces tone and is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the peak beat ("The vellum awaited, not as an end but a beginning—a seed planted in the soil of tomorrow") which, while beautiful, edges toward ornamentation in a moment of high causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats ("atmospheric ghosts," "hesitant readers") but does not obscure clarity or closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. A minor figurative density appears in the peak beat ("Each particle caught the light like fleeting sparks..."), slightly straining the established physical logic of dim light and ash, but it does not obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density ("sedimentary layers in the ruined avenues, each stratum a competing narrative"). No loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and consistent ("beacon of reason in the drowned dark"). Sentence variety and rhythm enhance the atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A single instance of potential synonym churn ("fractured her choir... silencing the very music") is minor and does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. Figurative language ("sky pulsed," "synaptic pathways lighting up") serves voice and pressure. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("synaptic plasticity of her brain reassembled the moment") slightly dulls immediacy—deduction -0.2. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm, clarity, and momentum. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., setting, character, and plot). No line-level artifacts, loops, or scaffold were detected. Figurative language is purposeful and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.4)
    Line-level craft is exceptional. The prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. A single, very minor quibble: "inadvertently profound" leans slightly toward telling, but it is immediately anchored in the concrete action of her work and is therefore a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally polished with high information density, though some sentences are slightly ornate ("cascade of revelations began unspooling"). Rhythm varies effectively, and closure beats are clear. No loops or scaffold artifacts, but minor overwriting in peak beats prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight register elevation in the peak beat ("crystallized from years of confinement") which feels slightly analytic for the POV's lexicon under extreme stress, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variety and sensory density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the opening paragraph ("wet wool," "polished bone," "false promise" in close succession), though the pattern is taught and maintained. No loops, scaffolds, or clarity issues; momentum is superb.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense, poetic, and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting and a register that, while generally consistent, occasionally leans into a heightened poeticism that can momentarily stall momentum. However, every sentence advances atmosphere or character, and there are no coherence-breaking artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density. Minor artifice appears in a near-paraphrase loop: "slow exhale of low tide" appears twice. However, this is pattern-taught and does not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation and high information density. A minor artifact penalty (-0.3) is applied for a cluster of dense metaphors in the high-pressure beat describing Fear's coalescence, which momentarily slows momentum without fully obscuring cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly vivid and rhythmic, with excellent information density. However, figurative language is pervasive in high-pressure beats, occasionally approaching overwriting (e.g., "sound imprinted patterns onto reality itself").

== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and purposeful. Sentences are constructed with a powerful rhythm and clarity, conveying complex ideas without a single wasted word or lapsing into academic dryness. The figurative language—the central analogy between dust accumulation and pulsar signal decay—is not ornamental but structural, forming the logical and emotional backbone of the narrative. There are no notable line-level artifacts, loops, or overwriting; the craft is clean and highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally demonstrates high information density. However, the piece is weakened by a few recurring phrases ("purpose in the pauses," "drifting resonance") that feel like authorial scaffolding or prompt remnants rather than organic language. These moments, while few, slightly disrupt the otherwise immersive rhythm and create a sense of meta-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lyrical, dense, and largely propulsive, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences like "tears carving paths down his cheeks, his thermal halo now a luminous gold" demonstrate a high level of craft. However, the final two paragraphs engage in some thematic paraphrase-looping, restating the core breakthrough in slightly different terms, which marginally dulls the impact of the final, sharp images and keeps the score from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and highly crafted, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the density of figurative language is consistently high, occasionally bordering on overwriting, which slightly impedes momentum in a few key beats ("shadows coiled and uncoiled...silent, pleading gestures of figures woven from kelp and memory"). While the quality is superb, a more varied textural rhythm would have elevated it further.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is lyrical, dense, and propelled by a strong internal rhythm. Word choice is precise and evocative. There are a couple of moments that border on cliché ("etched in the lines around his eyes," "glowing like a promise"), which slightly tempers the score. However, these are minor flaws in an otherwise beautifully crafted piece that demonstrates high-level control of sentence structure and momentum, with no significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and varied sentence structures. However, it occasionally verges on being overwritten with high-concept phrases that feel slightly outside the character's immediate experience ("pilgrim of sparks," "foggy lucidity"). A minor thematic summary ("It wasn’t a vault, but a living tapestry...") slightly dulls the climax by explaining what was already being powerfully shown, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and largely successful, with powerful and inventive figurative language ("smoke caught in amber," "time into origami shapes"). While the density of metaphor in the climax borders on overwhelming, it serves the disorienting, abstract nature of the event. The sentences are well-constructed with varied rhythms, and the piece is free of redundancies or scaffolding, demonstrating polished and confident line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally vivid and propelled by strong verbs. However, the final paragraph's structure devolves into a series of short, declarative sentences that summarize the story's meaning ("It would be enough. The wall had come down..."). This stylistic shift dulls the final image's impact, and combined with the repetition of key phrases, constitutes a text artifact that slightly hinders the closure's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and dense with striking, original imagery ("drowned sentinels," "bruised twilight sky"). While the level of figurative language is consistently high, it rarely feels overwritten, instead building a cohesive and immersive texture. There are no notable scaffold phrases or redundancies; every sentence works to advance the story's atmosphere, character, or momentum with impressive efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, its high density of figurative language occasionally feels overwritten, and certain phrases ("destiny's door," "luminous disbelief") are repeated, slightly dulling their impact. Sentences that summarize the theme disrupt momentum, reading more like authorial reflection than character-in-scene thought, which detracts from the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there are instances of overwriting and conceptual looping that slightly dull momentum. The phrase "weighty lightness" is introduced and then paraphrased in the final lines ("weighty with meaning, yet light enough to carry"), which feels redundant. Some figurative language, while evocative, adds density without necessarily advancing the immediate action in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious but frequently overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that can feel strenuous ("groaned under the weight of the stars," "skeletal metal shelves clawing"). Some sentences are sharp and propulsive, but others are burdened by mixed metaphors or clichés ("snapping like rotten thread"). The final paragraphs, in particular, accumulate thematic statements and abstract nouns, losing the specificity that grounded the earlier scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense with purposeful imagery. However, there is some minor conceptual looping, particularly with the recurring use and slight over-definition of "hush" and "silence" ("This hush wasn’t emptiness; it was an ambered hush... This was the silence to summarize"). While the style is intentional, a few moments of paraphrase slightly dampen the otherwise excellent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant, distracting artifacts that a top-tier publication would flag for revision. The phrase "remarkably composed" is looped six times, functioning as scaffolding that weakens characterization. The final section contains multiple paraphrase loops that restate the core realization, draining momentum from the otherwise strong closure ("thoughts arose from..." is immediately followed by "the origin was clear: thoughts came from...").

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong imagery like "a thousand tiny, liquid stars." However, it occasionally tips into being overwritten, with a density of figurative language that can slow momentum. Phrases such as "the transparency of a gesture" feel more abstract than concrete. While the rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, a few instances of near-redundancy ("deliberate yet indecipherable," "unspoken... where words became unnecessary") could be tightened for greater propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density in its imagery. However, there is a minor conceptual redundancy with the "blooming/withering" motif, which appears three times in slightly different phrasing. While it reinforces the theme, its repetition slightly dulls its impact by the final instance ("The maze sighed, blooming and withering..."). This small over-insistence is the only blemish on an otherwise beautifully crafted piece, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is evocative but significantly weakened by repetition and overwriting. Key phrases like "mechanically warm," "obliging," and "hush of beating wings at rest" are looped, dulling their impact and slowing momentum. This high density of descriptors and compound adjectives, while atmospheric, reads as a text artifact that prevents the prose from achieving the clean propulsion needed for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and precise sensory details. The momentum is well-maintained. Its primary weakness is a tendency toward overwriting, where the density of figurative language in some passages slightly dampens the immediacy of the action rather than sharpens it. There are no technical errors, but a lighter touch would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density. However, there is a slight tendency toward overwritten, abstract constructions, particularly in the first half (e.g., "her mind a lattice designed to absorb contradictions without collapsing"). While the language is beautiful, this density occasionally slows momentum by explaining its own metaphors rather than letting them work implicitly. The craft is very strong, but a lighter touch in a few key sentences would elevate it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and evocative for the most part, with strong verbs and specific sensory details. However, several key moments rely on abstract, conceptual phrases ("guilt becomes tangible," "crushing lightness") that tell the reader the emotional meaning rather than letting the concrete image do the work alone. This tendency toward summary at peak beats slightly dulls the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most lines. However, there are minor instances of near-redundancy that slightly soften the impact. For example, "regenerative silence bloomed – a profound quiet that didn’t merely lack sound, but actively mended..." sees the second half largely paraphrasing the concept introduced in the first. While beautiful, this and a few other similar constructions create a minor drag that keeps the prose just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong sensory details and a controlled rhythm. Sentences are generally well-crafted and carry momentum. The flaw preventing a higher score is a recurring reliance on abstract compound descriptors ("softly adaptive," "cautiously exuberant") that function as thematic labels rather than concrete descriptions, slightly flattening the prose's texture and creating moments of conceptual summary over sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative. However, a significant flaw occurs with the line "Bronze quiet: the term described the atmosphere perfectly," an authorial intrusion that explains the metaphor it just deployed, breaking narrative immersion. This specific misstep, along with some minor "telling" at the start ("Her motivation was singular"), prevents the prose from reaching the highest tier, despite its many strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant, concise, and propulsive. However, the final paragraph suffers from scaffolding and summary. Phrases like "hadn't predicted the storm; it had provided the key to navigating it" and "were never meant for espionage, but for this moment" explain the subtext that the action has already powerfully demonstrated. This lapse into telling at the very end dulls the impact of an otherwise sharp piece.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and exceptionally clean, with not a wasted word. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, such as "reality thinning like cheap paint" and silence as a "substance, thick and cool." The piece demonstrates masterful sentence-level propulsion, varying rhythm and structure to match the rising tension, and is entirely free of the loops or scaffolding that often weigh down prose of this complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and evocative, with high information density in its figurative language. While the style is consistently elevated, it occasionally borders on being overwritten, with metaphors in nearly every sentence. However, it avoids becoming a muddle and maintains propulsion through to the clear, powerful climax.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and is generally built on specific, evocative imagery. The sentence-level craft effectively propels the narrative forward. The primary weakness is a reliance on abstract conceptual phrases ("yesterday's despair, tomorrow's arrogance," "dead ends of regret") which summarize feeling rather than embodying it, slightly dulling the immediacy of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often luminous, with phrases like "tactile symphony" and "mirrored hush." However, it occasionally slips into overwriting, with conceptual phrases that feel more authorial than character-driven ("a physical language rewritten"). The final paragraph suffers from this most, weaving abstract metaphors ("tapestry of felt sound") and summary statements that dull the sharp, concrete imagery preceding them.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, concise, and often elegant, with strong verbs and high information density. Momentum is well-maintained. A minor penalty is applied for several instances of thematic summary and slightly overwrought phrasing in the final section (e.g., "a peace earned, not given," "the weight of a choice, and the lightness of doing right"), which feel less organic than the prose in the preceding beats.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong sensory details. The rhythm is well-paced, slowing for reflection and quickening at the moment of revelation. A minor weakness is a slight register drift with phrases like "synesthetic grief" and "neural purge protocols," which feel more clinical than the surrounding lyrical prose, momentarily breaking the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious, rhythmic, and rich with imagery. However, the very high density of figurative language and the repetition of key thematic phrases verge on overwriting in a few moments, slightly impeding momentum. While the effect is often beautiful, this density is a minor prose artifact that keeps the craft just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates high information density. However, in its pursuit of lyricism, the figurative language occasionally becomes overly dense, slightly impeding momentum. A line like "unbound not just the violin, but the world’s capacity to hear itself again" is a touch too declarative for the story's otherwise subtle execution, preventing a higher score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with a strong, controlled rhythm. Figurative language, such as describing grief in terms of fragrance notes ("sharp top notes of shock"), is both original and perfectly integrated with the story's concept. There are no wasted words or distracting artifacts; every sentence works to build atmosphere, advance Lena's process, or deepen the thematic inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally well-paced. However, the repetition of the specific phrase "cautious exuberance" to describe both the night/Aris and then Elena, while thematically linking them, reads as a minor prose artifact—a slight lack of lexical variety at a key moment. Otherwise, the sentence-level craft is strong, with good rhythm and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, it suffers from minor but noticeable repetition of key thematic phrases ("luminescent ache," "webs of kinship"), which can feel like authorial labels rather than the character's organic thought. This slight over-articulation in a few key places creates a minor drag on momentum, preventing the otherwise excellent prose from achieving flawless transparency.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density. However, there are moments of overwriting where figurative language becomes slightly too dense, particularly during the climax ("dizzying rush that slowed the dripping water to molasses, stretched starlight into threads"). Some phrases like "heart pounding" and "ink-stained fingers trembled" are functional but verge on cliché. Overall clarity and momentum are strong, but a final polish would trim these minor excesses.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and displays a strong command of rhythm and imagery. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful ("grief...a tangled net of violet threads"). The piece is exceptionally polished, with only a minor, almost unnoticeable structural repetition in a few sentences ("Her motivation was... Her approach was...") preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery ("Dawn bled sapphire," "infrastructure snaked like metallic roots"). The rhythm is controlled, modulating effectively between descriptive passages and moments of quiet action. A minor artifact, the repetition of the phrase "kindly methodical," appears as a slight loop that draws attention to itself, and a few moments lean towards being slightly overwritten, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and rich with sensory detail ("swollen the moss into emerald velvet"). It maintains momentum and clarity throughout, with high information density in each sentence. The only minor imperfection is the slight authorial scaffolding in the final thematic statement, which feels less visceral than the prose that precedes it, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and evocative imagery. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, creating a compelling narrative flow. The only minor weakness is a slight tendency toward uniform density; the figurative language is consistently elevated, which occasionally verges on overwriting, preventing the peaks and valleys that would make the most crucial images stand out even more starkly.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. The sentence craft effectively mirrors the narrative's shifts in tension. A minor weakness appears in the final paragraph, which slightly over-explains Elara's new purpose ("Elara knew her path: not to predict...but to listen..."), a moment of telling that slightly dilutes the powerful showing that immediately preceded it.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten; lines like "sound would stitch the silence" are exceptional. The rhythm and syntax support the story's melancholic but hopeful tone perfectly. The only minor imperfection is the final sentence, which functions as a thematic summary and slightly weakens the trust the prose otherwise places in its own powerful imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly atmospheric, with a strong cadence and varied sentence structure that drives momentum. Figurative language is generally sharp and purposeful ("laundry lines sagged like spiderwebs"). A few phrases like "trembling certainty" and "scent of unspoken truths" are slightly overwrought, explaining more than they evoke. However, these are minor blemishes in an otherwise polished and impactful piece with high information density and zero scaffolding or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and generally polished, with strong imagery and rhythmic control. However, it occasionally relies on familiar phrasing ("knuckles white," "dread that coiled in her chest") and abstract labels ("courageously kind"). While the figurative language is often effective, its high density at times feels more decorative than propulsive, slightly slowing the momentum in an otherwise concise narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and evocative, with powerful imagery throughout. However, a few minor artifacts prevent a 9+ score, such as a slight paraphrase loop ("This wasn’t random decay; it was rebellion. Dimensions were tearing free..."). These slips are minor and do not affect the powerful clarity of the closure beat, but they represent a small lapse in an otherwise exceptional piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. However, a few lines drift towards telling rather than showing the theme, slightly diminishing the otherwise powerful subtext. Phrases like "The ink pot’s magic wasn’t mystical—it was alchemy for the mind" and "his rigid thinking breached by the elegance of her model" over-articulate the story's mechanics. While minor, these moments slightly flatten the prose's texture in an otherwise stellar piece.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is consistently elegant and evocative, with high information density. However, there are minor but noticeable prose artifacts: the repetition of "earnestly studious" and "incandescent restraint" in close proximity feels like a slight authorial insistence rather than an organic echo. While the language is beautiful, these small loops momentarily break the seamless flow, preventing a higher score in an otherwise stellar category.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense with powerful, specific imagery ("erased histories clung to the port like salt crust"). Sentences are well-constructed and propel the narrative with a steady, deliberate momentum. The score is held just shy of the highest tier due to a few instances where thematic statements are made slightly too explicit, such as "memories weren’t recalled but rebuilt," momentarily telling what the rest of the story shows so brilliantly.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is lyrical, precise, and demonstrates high information density. However, a minor prose artifact slightly dulls the otherwise pristine closure beat: "the precise moment inside the whisper of closing pages" feels overwrought and less impactful than the simple action of the journal closing. This slight over-embellishment is the only blemish on an exceptionally crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, marked by high information density, rhythmic variation, and precise, evocative word choice. Lines like "Gentrification wasn’t a sudden storm; it was a slow seep" are concise and powerful. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, and every sentence works to advance character, atmosphere, or plot, demonstrating superior line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with high information density and strong rhythmic variation. However, there are minor artifacts that hold it back from perfection. The repetition of "purposefully curious" feels slightly mechanical, and the line "the sky a gradient of sorrow" is a touch of overwriting in an otherwise grounded narrative. These are small flaws but noticeable in a piece aiming for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, with strong verbs and precise, evocative imagery that propels the narrative. Sentences are well-structured and the pacing is controlled. The primary flaw is the final paragraph's thematic summary, which reads as a piece of authorial scaffolding that should have been removed to allow the final action to resonate on its own. It slightly dulls the otherwise sharp closure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and high-density, particularly in its evocative descriptions ("hues of bruised amethyst," "metal groaning like old bones"). Momentum is excellent until the final paragraph, which contains minor scaffolding and summary ("she’d earned this moment through stubborn precision"). While not a major flaw, this slight loss of concision at the very end keeps it from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and highly crafted, with a strong, lyrical rhythm. However, the figurative language is so consistently dense, especially in the opening paragraphs ("bruised twilight sky," "skeletal remains," "grim portrait," "taut wire"), that it verges on becoming overwrought. This sheer density, while stylistically impressive, slightly impedes momentum before the main action begins, representing a stylistic choice that a demanding editor would flag for slight moderation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often luminous and evocative, with strong verbs and a controlled rhythm. However, there is a recurring pattern of conceptual loops and near-redundant phrasing in the final third of the story. Sentences like "He’d harnessed the ephemeral, turning vanishing hush into salvation" are followed by similar statements that restate the same victory, which slightly slows the post-climax momentum. A more concise final section would have allowed the powerful closing image to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is highly ambitious and often beautiful, but occasionally tips into being overwrought. Sentences like "sustain the impossibility of his innocence" are conceptually dense but lack the clarity and propulsion of the story's best prose. While the rhythm and imagery are strong, a few instances of abstract, heavily lyrical phrasing slightly impede momentum in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, evocative, and rhythmically controlled. Figurative language, such as the veil shifting "like smoke" or silver leaves unfurling "like wings," is both beautiful and precise. The piece demonstrates exceptional concision, with no wasted words or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or the narrative's forward momentum. There are no line-level artifacts to disrupt the story's powerful current.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density. However, there are minor but noticeable prose artifacts that a top-tier publication would flag. Key phrases like "broken precedent" and "hauntingly optimistic" are repeated verbatim, which feels like a slight crutch rather than an intentional refrain. While the overall quality is very high, these small loops slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong rhythm and precise word choice. There are no significant technical errors. However, a handful of phrases are slightly abstract or explanatory ("a fragrance both alien and deeply familiar to the diaspora returnee"), which creates minor drag in an otherwise propulsive and evocative piece. The line-level craft is strong but not uniformly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a pervasive density of figurative language that verges on overwriting. Sentences are frequently laden with multiple metaphors or poetic adjectives, which can slow momentum and dull the impact of individual images. This consistent stacking of evocative language ("chalk codes blooming like wildflowers...a clandestine lexicon—dots and dashes forming constellations") functions as a prose artifact that slightly obscures the narrative's clean forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and evocative, with very few wasted words. Sentences like "Wisdom disguised as foolishness was her armor" and "stitched a new constellation...not a star, but a candle flame" demonstrate high-level craft. A few phrases, such as "a labyrinth of adjacent possibilities," feel slightly more abstract and less grounded than the surrounding concrete prose, but this is a minor imperfection in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with strong, specific verbs and evocative figurative language ("skeletal window," "bruised twilight"). Sentences are structured with intentional variety to control rhythm. The piece is exceptionally clean, with the only minor artifact being the repetition of the phrase "fierce tenderness," which feels more like a slight echo than a critical flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and striking, original figurative language ("lotus-hearted ache," "ghostly hieroglyphs"). The writing achieves a rare balance of being ornate yet clear, with the heightened sensory detail feeling psychologically justified by the character’s state. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or moments of imprecision; every line serves to advance character, atmosphere, or meaning with concision and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative and precise for the most part, with strong imagery. However, there are minor instances of overwriting where figurative language becomes slightly dense, such as "limbs tracing arcs of pure, pensive mirth." While generally clean, a few more passes for concision would elevate it further by trimming near-redundant phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from notable repetition and template cadence. The phrase "methodically playful" appears three times, and the structure of the climax is a repetitive list ("The first awakening... Then the second... a third awakening... A fourth awakening... a fifth layer..."). This looping structure feels mechanical and undermines the sense of organic discovery, making crucial moments read like an outline rather than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and largely flawless, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. Sentences like "Drones buzzed like angry wasps overhead, citizens moved with the taxed lethargy of the monitored" achieve maximum effect with minimal words. A minor repetition of "candidly cryptic" and a moment of summary-as-interiority ("His motivation wasn’t glory...") are the only slight imperfections in an otherwise masterful line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is incredibly dense and figurative, a high-risk style that the story successfully sustains. While bordering on overwriting, the language is precise, the verbs are strong ("clawed," "snatched," "bled"), and the imagery is internally consistent. The repetition of key phrases ("shyly unstoppable," "blossom armistice") functions as a thematic motif appropriate for the accumulative structure, though a slight sense of mannerism prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with each sentence carrying significant weight. The figurative language ("foxglove regret," "supernova of sound") is consistently inventive and supports the story's otherworldly feel. While the style is rich, it avoids becoming overwrought, maintaining clarity and propulsion through precise word choice and varied sentence rhythms, resulting in a polished and powerful piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and precise, with high information density in every sentence. Figurative language is rich but controlled, consistently reinforcing atmosphere and theme ("ink catching the lamplight like captured starlight"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the syntax varies to create a compelling rhythm that carries the reader through Elara's intense effort without a single misstep.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with vivid imagery and varied sentence structures. There is, however, a tendency toward overwriting, where dense adjectival phrases and figurative language occasionally accumulate in moments of high tension, slightly impeding momentum. Phrases like "slyly heartfelt audacity" and "dappled resolve" are evocative but border on the ornate, creating a minor drag on an otherwise propulsive narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density without sacrificing clarity or rhythm. Figurative language, such as the "slow ballet of dust motes," is purposeful and integrated. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to advance the story’s atmosphere, character, or momentum toward its quiet, powerful conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is ambitious, demonstrating high information density and a controlled, evocative rhythm. However, it is marked by a noticeable prose loop: the phrase "featherly determined" is used three times, and "fractured hush" is also repeated, with its final use feeling slightly less impactful. These repetitions, while purposeful, register as authorial artifacts that slightly mar an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally elegant and precise, with high information density. The rhythm and syntax support the story's mournful, wondrous tone. A minor weakness is a slight tendency to state symbolic importance directly ("The feather wasn't just debris; it was a key..."), which momentarily replaces propulsion with summary. It's a small but noticeable artifact that keeps the craft just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean but suffers from a persistent adjectival density ("crystalline dust," "iridescent cave," "cerulean sky-sparrow," "liquid sapphire") that borders on overwriting. While evocative, this stylistic choice slightly dulls momentum and information density. Some phrases, such as the multiple descriptions of memory fading, create minor conceptual redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally slips into summarizing the effect rather than allowing the concrete imagery to do the work alone. Phrases like "Serendipity happened exactly as she’d foreseen, a symphony born of tidal math" tell the reader the conceptual outcome, slightly dulling the immediacy of the otherwise powerful sensory description.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density and rhythmic sentences. However, the prose suffers from a relentless density of figurative language, which occasionally blurs clarity and feels overwrought, particularly during the high-pressure climax. While mostly effective, this tendency toward poetic excess is a recurring artifact that keeps the prose from achieving flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density. However, the section describing the rings ("The first ring... The next ring... Further out...") briefly adopts a slightly analytical, list-like cadence. This momentarily breaks the otherwise seamless flow of an experienced insight, reading more like a summary of the pattern than the raw perception of it.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it's hampered by a relentless density of figurative language that verges on overwriting. The sheer volume of metaphors ("liquid silver," "ember in his chest," "etched lessons") can feel suffocating and slightly clichéd in aggregate. This, combined with the abstract, didactic language at the climax, prevents the line-level craft from achieving true flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally elegant and dense with information, featuring strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the final paragraph, a critical moment for closure, is marred by paraphrase loops that dull momentum. Sentences like "Hope wasn’t a fixed point but a dynamic system..." and "...hope thrived when patterns acknowledged interdependence..." restate the same core idea multiple times before the final equation. This artifact at the closure beat significantly weakens the story's landing.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is consistently strong, with evocative and precise imagery, particularly in its description of the setting. The sentence structure is varied and the rhythm supports the story's momentum. A minor weakness is a slight tendency toward abstract conceptual phrases ("spiritual fracture") and a few stock constructions ("settle in his bones") that momentarily thin the otherwise rich texture.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density in its imagery ("refracting the dying light into fleeting rainbows that danced across the worn flagstones"). The sentence structure is varied and rhythmic, propelling the narrative forward with a quiet grace. While there is a minor instance of telling what's just been shown ("Grace wasn’t just her movement; it was the precision..."), the line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong and free of significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with a strong, consistent rhythm. Word choice is precise and imagery is effective, such as Kael's face being a "roadmap of old battles." While the prose is highly elevated, a slight repetition of the phrase "operatively gentle" and the consistently high register create a faint trace of mannerism, but this is a minor observation in an otherwise immaculate piece of writing with no technical flaws or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and often brilliant, with phrases like "ghost-song of birds" and "a captured fragment of vanished sky" achieving a high lyrical quality. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, propelling the short narrative with confidence. A hairline flaw appears in a moment of slight over-explanation ("the tone of the place fractured grace incarnate"), a rare instance of telling in a piece that otherwise demonstrates mastery of showing.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, with high information density and varied sentence structures that create a compelling rhythm. While the density of figurative language is consistently high, it successfully avoids collapsing into purple prose due to the coherence of the voice. The only minor critique is a lack of modulation; the uniformly elevated register, especially at the climax, feels slightly breathless where a moment of simple, declarative force might have hit harder.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong, with evocative and precise language. There are, however, moments where the prose risks becoming overwritten, with dense figurative language ("thick, waiting quality of meteor hush") that calls attention to itself. Additionally, a minor cliché ("fragile, exposed nerve") momentarily breaks the otherwise specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, its high information density sometimes tips into overwriting, with figurative language stacked heavily in nearly every sentence. There are also minor instances of paraphrase loops ("a silent plea, a marker of witness") and scaffolding phrases that slightly dull the momentum, particularly in the reflective passages, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and imagistic, with high information density and a strong, rhythmic cadence. Sentences are crafted with precision. The score is slightly limited by a minor paraphrase loop—the phrase "technically gentle" is used twice in quick succession to describe her movements. This, combined with the thematic summary sentences at the end which stall momentum, constitutes a small but noticeable prose artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with a strong, varied rhythm and high information density. Word choice is precise and often surprising ("bruised purple," "pleading hands"). While the style verges on overwritten at times with its consistent level of figurative language ("riddle wrapped in decay," "cathedral of moss"), it remains coherent and serves the story's ethereal tone. There are no significant text artifacts, loops, or scaffold phrases to impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and dense with well-chosen imagery. The sentence structure varies effectively, mirroring the pace of Kael's thoughts and actions. A minor deduction is warranted for the repetitive use of the phrase "empirically ironic," which feels like a thematic signpost rather than organic thought, slightly marring an otherwise impeccable line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with a controlled rhythm. The primary weakness is a tendency to summarize action and intent in the midst of a scene, such as stating this was a “nonviolent confrontation where grace, not force, would do the work.” This scaffolding, while not pervasive, momentarily stalls momentum by telling the reader what to conclude rather than letting the action carry the meaning forward.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and rich with vivid, specific imagery. However, a few minor flaws hold it back from perfection. There are instances of near-redundancy ("useless for measuring star angles...now blind") that could be tightened. Most critically, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary, telling the reader the meaning of the climax rather than letting the powerful imagery complete its work, which slightly stalls the momentum at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative, with high information density in most sentences. The language is consistently strong, particularly in its descriptions of the cathedral and Elara’s work. There is a minor paraphrase loop in the final paragraphs regarding the inadequacy of contracts, which slightly dulls the momentum before the final, powerful image. However, the overall craft is at a very high level, with clean syntax and purposeful rhythm throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and evocative, precise language ("crystalline trees, shimmering with bioluminescent petals"). The prose propels the narrative with a varied and lyrical rhythm, free of significant scaffolding or loops. While a couple of phrases lean towards familiar constructions ("questions swirled"), these are minor instances in an otherwise polished and inventive piece where nearly every sentence serves character, atmosphere, and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is clean and propulsive, but suffers from moments of conceptual redundancy ("fading from the temporal weave," "vanished into the void," "dissolve into temporal dust"). The final two paragraphs lean heavily on summary to convey resonance ("merely one movement in an eternal composition"), telling the reader the meaning of the events rather than letting the final image carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a tendency towards overwriting results in an extreme density of figurative language that occasionally hinders momentum and clarity. Certain phrases, like the repetition of "blissfully aberrant," feel like minor slips, and some constructions introduce a concept only to immediately explain it, reading like scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, clear, and demonstrates strong syntactical control, maintaining momentum effectively. The primary weakness lies in a tendency toward abstraction and near-cliché at moments of high emotional or thematic importance. Phrases like “clarity flooded,” “flutter in her chest,” and “quiet certainty” are functional but lack the specificity and freshness seen in the story's physical descriptions, slightly dulling the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, precise, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. While the density of figurative language is high ("frozen lightning," "bloom of hush"), it is coherent and builds a potent atmosphere without collapsing into purple prose. A minor point of critique is the slightly explanatory phrase "not to amplify, but to invert," which momentarily tells rather than shows, but it's a very small slip in an otherwise masterfully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, particularly in its descriptive passages. Momentum is well-maintained. A minor repetitive sentence structure ("not with fire, but with..."; "not the blinding flare... but a soft...") and a few slightly familiar phrases ("ember of hope," "weight of her conviction") are small blemishes on otherwise polished line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with many memorable images like "solidified fog that clung like cold glass" and "distilled starlight." However, there is a persistent tendency towards overwriting, particularly a high density of adjectives in the opening paragraph ("summer-quill," "damp," "stone," "newly solidified," etc.). While evocative, this density occasionally slows the momentum and feels slightly labored, preventing the prose from achieving effortless clarity and pushing it towards the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density in every line. Figurative language like "dusk bled into the fortress walls" and "scent thick as velvet" is evocative without being overwrought. The rhythm of the sentences shifts with the character’s focus, and there are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding. The clarity and propulsion of the line-level craft are of the highest caliber, supporting the story's quiet intensity without a single misstep.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with a high degree of information and sensory detail packed into each sentence. While bordering on lush, the figurative language ("stars so sharp they seemed carved from ice," "anticipation thickened the air like salt in mist") remains coherent and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without obscuring meaning. The piece is free of loops, scaffolding, or other line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its relentless density of figurative language occasionally works against it, particularly in peak moments. Phrases like "impossibly light and heavy as lead" rely on cliché, and the stacking of multiple metaphors to describe the gilded hush slightly muddles the otherwise sharp imagery. While the rhythm is controlled, a more disciplined selection of metaphors would elevate the craft further.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, it contains minor but noticeable artifacts that hold it back from the highest tier. The repetition of "fluidly logical" is a template-like tic, and the initial use ("He moved fluidly logical") is grammatically awkward, creating a slight abrasion in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often striking, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, the density of figurative language becomes excessive for a short piece, tipping into overwriting where nearly every sentence carries a simile or metaphor. This lyrical density, while beautiful in isolation, slightly clogs the narrative momentum and feels more performative than immersive at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative, dense, and demonstrates a high level of craft. Sentence-level propulsion is generally strong, creating a somber, deliberate momentum. A notable prose artifact in the final paragraph—a paraphrase loop that restates the thematic action we just witnessed—dulls the closure beat and prevents the piece from reaching the highest tier for line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong verbs and evocative, dense imagery that serves the story's atmosphere well. The rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful, particularly under pressure. The score is slightly capped by a few phrases that lean toward being overwritten and, more significantly, by the final sentence, which reads like a thematic summary rather than letting the potent image it follows do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong momentum. However, it occasionally indulges in overwriting, with figurative language that can feel overly dense, such as "the first yawn of evening" or "gilded the floating motes." While generally effective, this lushness slightly detracts from the otherwise crisp execution, particularly in the opening. The final paragraph's summary-like phrasing also feels less sharp than the potent imagery that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with powerful images like "voice like dry leaves skittering on stone." However, there are moments where the density of figurative language slightly impedes momentum, such as "the peculiar, clinging residue of failed alchemical blooms." The phrase "factually mystical weight" is a minor register drift that intellectualizes an otherwise embodied experience, keeping the line-level craft just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, but it occasionally slips into overwriting, with dense metaphors that slightly slow the momentum ("dust motes swirling in the weak afternoon light like forgotten constellations"). There are minor paraphrase loops in the final paragraph where her newfound purpose is re-stated in several ways. These artifacts, while not severe, prevent the prose from achieving the high level of concision and propulsion seen in flawless work.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is clean, dense, and propulsive, with nearly every sentence serving multiple functions. Figurative language, like the auric light "clinging to his skin like liquid starlight," is evocative without becoming overwrought. A single phrase, "Kael moved carefully resourceful," feels slightly less elegant than the surrounding prose, but this is a minuscule flaw in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece with no loops, scaffolding, or wasted words.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious, with high information density and evocative figurative language ("played the fog itself into submission"). The rhythm is deliberate and well-controlled, matching the scene's tension. While there are no technical flaws like loops or scaffolds, the sheer density of metaphor occasionally feels slightly overwrought, a minor indulgence that prevents it from reaching the highest tier of effortless clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, with high information density in most lines. There is, however, a minor reliance on stock constructions during key moments of realization, such as "Understanding washed over her," which slightly dulls the impact. While these instances are infrequent, their placement at pivotal beats prevents the prose from reaching the highest tier of excellence, representing a small but noticeable seam in an otherwise seamless craft.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and vivid, specific imagery ("gears fused by heat no fire could explain," "stalactites hung like stone fangs"). The rhythm is controlled, modulating effectively between reflection and action. The piece is exceptionally clean, free of verbal tics, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and demonstrates high command of rhythm and imagery, with very few flaws. Sentences are crafted with care, creating a momentum that is both stately and propulsive. A minor deduction is warranted for a few phrases that lean toward abstraction ("factually mystical, the principle demanded") and the thematic summary near the end, which slightly dilutes the power of the preceding scene work. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in its descriptive passages ("bruised gold and lavender"). However, a few phrases contain minor scaffolding or feel slightly overwritten. Lines like "guided by a modestly fearless resolve honed by years of witnessing sorrow" and "She intensified the pursuit, not chasing the spirit, but chasing the truth within the dissonance" explain the character's state or action rather than fully embodying it. These are small blemishes on an otherwise polished and propulsive piece.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, ambitious, and highly effective, with strong verbs and high information density on every line. The rhythm and syntax modulate well with the rising tension, creating a sense of both intellectual rigor and physical agony. While the language is highly figurative ("shards of glass in his...mind," "dissonant symphony of pain"), it remains coherent and serves the story's high-concept atmosphere. A minor, almost imperceptible paraphrase loop ("Displaced... yet rooted here" immediately followed by "Displaced rooted:") is the only hairline fissure in an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often elegant and features striking imagery, such as waves resolving into "liquid shadow" with glyphs like "drowned stars." However, there are instances of overwriting where abstract concepts are stacked densely ("elusively tangible and heavy with memory," "time existed as an eternal instant"), slightly dulling the immediacy. The final paragraph, in particular, becomes heavy with conceptual language at the expense of concrete, grounding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. Lines like "the architecture of decay" and the sound of the bird's wings like "distant applause" are memorable and effective. While overwhelmingly strong, a few phrases like "lies beneath the painted smiles" verge on the familiar, a minor point in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it occasionally leans into dense abstraction and overwriting that slightly dulls its impact. Phrases like "pulsed with contained urgency" border on cliché, and the density of figurative language can feel crowded. A minor scaffolding sentence, "His motivation was clear," detracts from an otherwise strong showing, preventing the piece from reaching the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and highly evocative, with strong, clear sentences driving the momentum. The language is ambitious and mostly successful, though a few phrases like "burnished sorrow" or "ideological certainty" feel slightly pre-packaged. The final paragraph's directness is a minor flaw in an otherwise stellar piece of line-level craft; the clarity and propulsion are undeniable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly effective, with high information density in every sentence. Figurative language is not ornamental but serves to build the world's unique physics ("ghosts of melodies," "breathing dishonesty"). The rhythm and syntax build momentum toward the climax, achieving clarity and propulsion without any evidence of scaffolding or overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong verbs. Sentences like "the lagoon’s surface undisturbed by wind or time, holding a resonant hush so profound it vibrated in her molars" demonstrate exceptional craft. A minor point of friction is the conceptual label "hinged awakenings," which feels slightly more writerly and abstract than the otherwise grounded, sensory-rich prose surrounding it.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is often evocative and rhythmically strong. The primary weakness is the repetitive cycling of thematic keywords ("reimagine," "scaffold," "alliances," "layered meanings," "perpetually learning"). This functions as a form of scaffold/looping at the conceptual level, creating redundancy that dulls the momentum and impact of an otherwise poetic piece.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and sentences are well-crafted, with a strong rhythmic quality. Momentum is generally excellent, though the final paragraph shifts from showing to telling, summarizing the thematic journey rather than allowing the image of the new mural to carry the full weight of the conclusion. This slightly reduces the propulsion of the final beat, though the line-level execution remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and dense with evocative imagery ("bruised twilight sky like a wound in the earth"). Sentence structure is varied, and momentum is well-maintained. A minor repetitive artifact exists with the phrase "retrocognitively trapped," which appears twice in close proximity. The primary flaw is the final sentence, which feels slightly overwritten and declarative compared to the more imagistic prose that precedes it, but the overall craft is very high.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with high information density and a strong, rhythmic cadence. Figurative language, such as the pier’s "weary bones," is generally effective and integrated. The piece is held back from a higher score by a few minor instances of abstract summary over concrete embodiment, like "His motivation burned fierce and pure," which momentarily flatten the otherwise vivid texture.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and highly evocative, with very few wasted words. The rhythm and syntax modulate effectively to build tension. A couple of phrases, such as the sky "bleeding crimson" or a voice "cracking like the wax," verge on the familiar, which is the only element holding the line-level craft back from utter perfection. Otherwise, it demonstrates exceptional control and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and demonstrates exceptional control of rhythm and syntax. Information is packed into every line without feeling cluttered. While the sheer volume of figurative language at the climax risks overwriting, it succeeds by focusing on conveying a specific, non-visual sensation. A minor deduction for a single cliché phrase ("immense and weightless"), but the overall craft is at a very high level.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its sensory descriptions. The rhythm is controlled and purposeful, mirroring the story's quiet tension. The score is held just shy of the 9-band due to a minor prose artifact: a conceptual paraphrase loop where the core motivation ("favor listening over noise" vs. "resist the noise of protocol") is restated in similar terms, slightly dulling its impact on the second mention.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and evocative. Word choice is precise and imagery is consistently strong, such as "star-dust glittered on his knuckles like captured constellations." The sentence structure varies to control momentum effectively. A minor weakness is a slight tendency toward overt declaration in key moments, like the phrase "a flourishing stillness where panic should have ruled," which feels less organic than the surrounding descriptions. Overall, the line-level craft is of a very high caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often luminous, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, it is marked by a recurring prose artifact: the repeated use of abstract labels as a substitute for demonstration. The phrase "contextual clues" appears three times, functioning as a scaffold that tells the reader how Silas understands things rather than showing the process. This, along with "tranquilly perceptive" and "mute eloquence," creates a slight conceptual loop that dulls the line-level immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery like "ash whispering" and a "voice, thin as spider-silk." However, momentum is occasionally slowed by scaffold-like sentences that summarize internal states ("Her motivation crystallized," "She now understood"). These moments of telling, rather than showing, slightly blunt the immediacy of Elara's journey, particularly when they articulate thematic points directly.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally elegant and clear, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, there are instances of overwriting and conceptual redundancy, particularly in the final two paragraphs which restate the central insight in several different ways. Phrases like "The snapped kite string had not ended a flight but begun a discovery—the feather a testament to what endures when we stop seeking wholeness" feel like scaffolding that should have been removed, slightly dulling the sharpness of the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong imagery like "time thinning like mist" and copper wire gleaming "like veins." However, the momentum is slightly dulled by the aforementioned repetition of the key phrase "brazen calm," a prose artifact that stands out in an otherwise clean text. There is also minor conceptual looping around the definitions of his work ("collaboration," "translation," "diplomacy"), which could be tightened for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, marked by high information density, precise word choice, and evocative imagery ("luminous skeptic," "hushed, metallic stillness"). There is no scaffolding, redundancy, or rhythmic monotony; every sentence works to advance character, atmosphere, or plot. The clarity and elegance of the language, especially in the technical descriptions, are flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and specific imagery. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the patient, deliberate actions of the protagonist. A few moments, like "He understood this new concord must rise from land," function as minor scaffolding, briefly summarizing an idea that the action already implies, which is the only element holding the prose back from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lyrical, dense, and evocative, but held back by a few minor artifacts. Phrases like "heart hammered against his ribs" are cliché, and the two-word sentence "Tinted revelations" feels slightly mannered. A moment of summary ("Each symbol clicked into place...") slightly lessens the impact of the discovery. Despite these small issues, the line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with strong imagery and varied sentence rhythms that support the atmosphere of stretched time. Lines like "the sky bled with slow-motion constellations" are superb. However, a few moments lean toward abstraction and summarizing emotional shifts, such as when her confusion "dissolved into purpose." This tendency slightly dulls the immediacy of the otherwise powerful final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong imagery that builds a palpable atmosphere. However, it suffers from a degree of conceptual repetition, with key phrases like "sacred play" and "dancing with chaos" acting as a scaffold that feels over-explained. The density of figurative language occasionally borders on overwriting, and the line-level craft, while skilled, could benefit from more trust in the reader to grasp the theme without explicit reinforcement.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong sentence-level propulsion and a high density of meaning. The language is precise and evocative, particularly in its descriptions of gesture and light. However, there are minor instances of overwriting where figurative language feels slightly forced or redundant, such as the pairing of "luminous absence" with "bright emptiness." These moments are infrequent and do not disrupt the momentum or clarity of the powerful climax, but they prevent the prose from reaching flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and imagistic, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. However, in the final paragraphs, the momentum is slightly dampened by a cluster of declarative, summary-like phrases ("a compass forged from buried talent," "remembering didn’t scorch; it soothed"). These moments of telling, rather than showing, slightly undermine the otherwise stellar line-level craft by explaining the story's resolution too explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is evocative and dense with strong, deliberate imagery, such as "thunder’s lull punctuating the woven hush." While generally excellent, there are minor instances of near-redundancy and overwriting ("fidgeted productively," "her fidgeting hands now purposeful") that slightly slow momentum. The overall craft is high, but a more concise execution in a few key phrases would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there's a slight tendency toward overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that occasionally feels stacked. A minor paraphrase loop occurs early ("to refract a single, rigid truth..." is immediately followed by a restatement about a "single, suffocating narrative"), a small artifact that briefly slows momentum. The ending relies on abstract nouns ("understanding," "harmony") where a more concrete final image might have landed with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and specific, sensory imagery. The rhythm and syntax vary effectively to match the rising tension. While generally excellent, a few phrases like "Uncertain alchemist that she was" feel slightly formal, and the highly abstract nature of the final realization sentence is less potent than the concrete action accompanying it.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and demonstrates high information density. However, a few moments of overwriting and stock phrasing ("ghosts of yesterday," "sorrow like ballast") slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution. Phrases like "the world was still broken, yet whole in its mending" feel a bit too polished and abstract, bordering on thematic summary rather than concrete observation. These instances are minor but prevent the prose from reaching the highest tier of flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a minor repetitive sentence stem ("This was his chance... This was his method... This was screaming tenderness...") creates a noticeable, if slight, template cadence that momentarily flattens the rhythm. While the overall quality is very high, this small artifact and the thematic over-articulation at the end hold it back from the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is evocative and dense, with strong verb choices and specific, textured imagery. There is a tendency toward stacking figurative language ("starlit signal station stood silent, its hydraulic pistons seized," "moonlight bled through the cracked observation dome"), which, while effective, occasionally verges on being overwritten for a high-pressure scene. The final paragraph's rhythm becomes slightly declarative, shifting from lyrical propulsion to summary.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and high-density, with strong verbs and purposeful sentence structure that maintains momentum. The craft is excellent throughout, but the final sentence—"...carrying the scent of wet earth and healing"—is a minor cliché that slightly softens an otherwise sharp ending. This, combined with the thematic overstatement in the final paragraph, holds the prose back from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is luminous and evocative, with high information density in most lines. However, a few phrases in the final third lean slightly toward thematic summary, slightly diminishing the power of the dramatized discovery. Lines like "the gaps... were bridges, not absences" and "Gratitude, not for shelter, but for the stranger’s trust" state the theme a little too directly, creating a minor scaffolding artifact that prevents a higher score for an otherwise masterful piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and largely concise, but it is marred by a significant prose artifact: the triple repetition of the phrase "empirically intuitive." This functions as a label-scaffold, telling the reader a trait that the action (following the ants) already shows effectively. This redundancy slightly dulls the momentum and feels like a lack of confidence in the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("viscous strands of silver light oozed... dripping like molten mercury"). Sentence structure is varied, providing a compelling rhythm that carries the reader through the short narrative without a single wasted word. There are moments where the figurative language becomes very thick, bordering on overwriting, but it consistently serves the story's high-fantasy, atmospheric tone without sacrificing clarity at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is hampered by a tendency toward high-density abstraction and moments of overwriting. Phrases like "emotional spectrum of a single, perfect moment held fast" create a slight distance. More critically, the final third contains minor paraphrase loops ("preserve the pain... honoring the *now*") and thematic summaries that state the character's change too explicitly, slightly dulling the impact of the otherwise powerful final actions and images.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and concrete imagery ("carved words to bind the bleeding timelines"). Momentum is well-maintained, and the language is consistently high-quality. The score is held just below the highest tier due to a slight tendency towards conceptual stacking ("temporal disarray," "temporal poison," "chronologically confused fracture"), where abstract nouns occasionally cluster, slightly lessening the visceral impact in a few key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is lyrical, precise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. The rhythm is controlled, slowing and quickening with Elara’s internal state. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to the story's momentum and atmosphere. The line-level craft is consistently strong and supports the story's quiet power from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong sensory details. The rhythm and syntax support the story's momentum, breathing and tightening with the character's internal state. A minor deduction is warranted for a slight paraphrase loop early on, where "breath caught mid-inhale" and "Time itself seemed to hold its breath" restate the same concept in adjacent sentences, a small stumble in otherwise immaculate craft.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and highly polished, with very little wasted language. Figurative language is deployed with precision and supports the story's tone, as in "silence thick as unplayed sheet music." While a couple of lines verge on summarizing a character trait ("You advise through metaphors now"), they are quickly dramatized, making the efficiency a strength at this length. The overall craft is exceptional, with strong rhythm and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but occasionally tips into being overwrought, with a high density of abstract, figurative language that can feel strenuous. There are minor instances of paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy, such as the repeated descriptions of the dictionary's definitions. While the rhythm is controlled, the lexical choices sometimes favor abstraction over concrete, visceral imagery, slightly dulling the story's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and often demonstrates high information density, particularly in its descriptions of the station and the horizon. The rhythm is controlled and effective. Minor repetitive structures, such as the "[number], [number], and [realization]" cadence, create a slight template feel in the middle, and a few phrases like "eminently peculiar" are repeated in a way that feels more like a mannerism than a necessary motif.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose in the story's second half is severely weakened by pervasive paraphrase-loops and conceptual redundancy. Multiple consecutive sentences and paragraphs restate the same outcome—the farm is glowing, a revolution has occurred, she has let go—which grinds momentum to a halt. This repetition dulls the impact of the climax and reads like a series of affirmations rather than a narrative progression, a significant structural flaw at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong sensory details. However, the story suffers from a significant prose artifact: the phrase "lucid contradiction" is repeated multiple times as a thematic label. This repetition acts as scaffolding, telling the reader how to interpret events rather than allowing the meaning to emerge organically, which dulls the momentum and feels like a conceptual loop.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most lines. However, a few moments of paraphrase-looping slightly dull the momentum. For instance, "He had taught them to begin again by ending with grace. Now, Elena was learning the same truth: that letting go was the first step forward" restates the same concept in adjacent sentences. This minor scaffolding prevents the prose from reaching the highest tier of flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and powerful imagery. The rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful, creating a deeply immersive experience. A deduction is applied for the repeated use of abstract terms from the story's conceptual framework ("regenerated covenant," "proximate causes"). These phrases act as minor prose artifacts, briefly interrupting the lyrical flow with a sense of intellectual scaffolding that feels less integrated than the rest of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive. Word choices are consistently strong and specific (e.g., "desperately jocular," "polite anarchy"), creating vivid images and conveying complex ideas with efficiency. There are no wasted words or movements; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or momentum. The line-level craft is of a professional, immediately publishable quality, free of artifacts or rhythmic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and precise sensory language. However, there is a tendency toward overwriting in a few key moments, with phrases like "rewrite her inner cartography" feeling more like abstract authorial concepts than the character's immediate thoughts. This figurative density, while often beautiful, occasionally slows momentum and creates a slight register drift from the otherwise grounded, tactile experience.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally elegant and precise, but it occasionally becomes heavy with its own thematic metaphors ("bitter harvest," "poisoned soil," "chaff of regret"). This density, combined with the repeated phrase "confidently uncertain," creates a minor textual artifact that slightly dulls momentum. While the line-level craft is strong, a lighter touch with the figurative language would allow the core emotional moments to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and highly polished, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentence structure and rhythm vary effectively to match the story's emotional cadence. A minor hesitation is the slight tendency to label the climactic emotion ("Joy flooded Elara," "joyful sorrow"), which, while earned, is a moment of telling in a story that otherwise excels at showing. This is a hairline flaw in an otherwise stellar piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and generally propulsive. However, a few instances of overwriting slightly dull its edge. The triple repetition of "volcanic tenderness" feels self-conscious, and the word "portray" is used somewhat awkwardly in key moments ("portrayed the hidden message in her mind"). These minor artifacts slightly detract from an otherwise polished execution.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous and dense with purpose, especially in its descriptions of sound becoming light. There are no wasted words or scaffold-like constructions. A single phrase, "carved hollows in the soul," verges on stock phrasing, a minor blemish in an otherwise impeccable line-level performance. The final line provides a stark, perfect cadence, contrasting powerfully with the preceding lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid sensory details and a confident rhythm. However, a few key phrases like "a study in calculated spontaneity" or "his frustration a physical thing" feel slightly overwrought and self-conscious. While there are no significant line-level errors, these moments of stylized telling prevent the prose from achieving a state of seamless immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it frequently tips into overwriting. Phrases like "invisible fabric of hope" and "physical manifestation of stillwater tension" feel overly ornate and abstract. There are minor but noticeable artifacts, including the repetition of "spiralingly calm" and moments that summarize an emotional shift ("understanding dawning") instead of letting the action complete its work. These issues prevent the prose from being flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery ("cobalt-tinted windows...swallowing the town’s mist like ink in water"). Momentum is well-maintained, and the sentences have a varied, pleasing rhythm. The piece loses minor points for occasional phrasing that feels more like authorial summary than in-world thought, such as explaining Elara's motivation directly or the final sentence ("inviting the future to take root"), which slightly over-explains the resonant image preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there are minor but noticeable text artifacts. The phrase "combative tenderness" is repeated, and there is a slight paraphrase loop where the scrimshaw's warmth is described in two successive sentences. These small redundancies slightly dull the momentum in an otherwise sharp piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, concise, and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in nearly every sentence. Figurative language, like "shavings curling like pale smoke" and the turbines as a "government lullaby," is fresh and purposeful. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the read-aloud quality is excellent, with syntax and pacing perfectly modulating the story's quiet tension.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but verges on being overwritten, with high figurative density in nearly every sentence. There are minor paraphrase loops where the same idea is restated with different phrasing (e.g., the nature of boundaries as illusions). While generally clear and propulsive, a more varied sentence structure and a reduction in redundant descriptive layers would have heightened the impact of the key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is superb, with high information density and rhythmic grace from the opening sentence. Word choice is precise and evocative, avoiding overwriting while creating a rich, immersive texture. The prose is completely free of artifacts, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating a level of polish and control that is immediately publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but its high density of figurative language and complex sentence structures occasionally slows momentum. The repetition of specific phrases ("powerfully gentle," "golden shadows") feels slightly mechanical. While the language is controlled, its richness sometimes verges on overwriting, sacrificing propulsive clarity for textural effect, which is the story's most notable weakness.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is often evocative, but it is marred by a critical, immersion-breaking flaw in a pivotal sentence: the appearance of the Chinese characters "顽强 life." This text artifact is an immediate disqualifier for a top-tier publication. Additionally, the over-reliance on italics for emphasis on key thematic phrases feels like a form of authorial scaffolding rather than an organic element of the prose style, slightly weakening the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, particularly in the opening and closing paragraphs. However, there are instances of overwriting where the story explains its own metaphor, such as describing the measuring tape as quantifying "unquantifiable grief." Phrases like "correlating physical space with the intensity of perceived societal rupture" create a slight register drift into academic jargon that feels less immediate than the surrounding prose.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious, with elegant rhythm and powerful imagery. However, it occasionally slips into abstraction and contains minor but noticeable artifacts. The line "they sought order in chaos, imposing patterns on the unpatternable" is a paraphrase loop that restates the same idea. While the overall effect is strong, these moments of slight redundancy and conceptual summary lack the concision seen elsewhere, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from a consistently high density of figurative language and abstraction that verges on being overwrought. Sentences like "to preserve the shape of hope, a fragile geometry easily distorted" risk intellectualizing an emotional beat. This density slightly weighs down the narrative momentum and can obscure the concrete action it describes.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, there are instances of conceptual redundancy that slightly slow the momentum. For example, describing the tail tip as "the silent witness, a physical manifestation of the fragile convictions" is a paraphrase loop that states the same idea twice. These minor artifacts, while not pervasive, detract from the otherwise high level of craft, especially in a piece aiming for flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. Sentences are information-dense and propel the narrative forward. The only minor weakness is a tendency towards high figurative density in nearly every sentence, which occasionally borders on overwriting and slightly slows the momentum of an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and evocative, but there are instances of conceptual looping where the idea of "unused love" is restated in slightly different terms across adjacent sentences. The final few paragraphs also tend to summarize the emotional and thematic resolution, creating some drag after the climactic action. While individual sentences are well-crafted, this slight redundancy at key moments dulls the overall propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is remarkably dense and figurative, yet it maintains clarity and momentum throughout. Word choice is precise and evocative ("choked gasps of stifled song," "silent detonation"), and the syntax varies to match the story's emotional rhythm. While bordering on effusive, the figurative language consistently serves to deepen the story's core concepts rather than becoming ornamental, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft without any notable artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, striking figurative language ("a sound like broken glass singing"), and a controlled, elegant rhythm. Every sentence works to build atmosphere, advance the character's internal state, or move the minimal plot forward. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or moments of overwriting; the craft is clean, confident, and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong imagery and momentum. The sentence-level craft is high, especially in descriptions of the forest. The primary weakness is a tendency toward scaffolding ("Elara realized," "Elara understood") and a final paragraph that summarizes rather than embodies, slightly flattening the prose's previously sharp edge.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it suffers from conceptual repetition. Key phrases like "shoreline lullaby" and "gently persistent" are reused, creating a patterned but slightly mechanical feel. This repetition acts as a thematic scaffold that can feel heavy-handed, telling the reader what to feel instead of letting the images do the work. The syntax is solid, but these loops slightly dull the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there are moments where figurative language stacks up, slightly dulling momentum, as in the description of hope being "thin as ice, brittle as the fortress's outer walls." Some phrases verge on abstraction ("seraphically mundane endurance"), and there is a minor paraphrase loop in the final paragraph about her remaining as a student/witness, which prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exquisite, marked by lyrical rhythm, high information density, and precise word choice that never feels overwrought. Sentences like "His voice shattered the temple’s hush like dropped glass" and "his empire of lies reduced to dust motes in moonlight" are both beautiful and functional. The piece is entirely free of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts, displaying a polish and clarity that is immediately publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and dense with purpose. Line-level craft is very high, with strong verbs and precise imagery that build a consistent atmosphere. Sentences like "consequences outlasted causes" are both elegant and impactful. The piece avoids major artifacts, though a few moments verge on being slightly overwritten with descriptive adjectives ("frayed edge," "faded ink," "indifferent swell"), a very minor flaw in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and evocative, rhythmic sentences. The language is precise and luminous, avoiding cliché. A minor flaw appears in a tendency toward neatly summarized wisdom, such as "Serenity wasn’t emptiness; it was the space where meaning could grow," which reads as slightly too philosophical and less embodied than the surrounding prose.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, with strong verbs and purposeful sensory details. Momentum is well-maintained. The primary weakness is a tendency toward thematic summary and a minor paraphrase loop in the final paragraph, where two consecutive sentences restate the same conceptual shift, slightly dulling the sharpness of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong sensory details and a controlled rhythm. However, momentum is occasionally slowed by sentences that state thematic conclusions directly rather than letting them emerge from the action. This creates moments of abstraction and redundancy, particularly in the story’s second half, where showing gives way to telling.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but occasionally veers into overwriting. Figurative language is dense, and while mostly effective, some phrases like "a luminescent ache that mirrored her own hollowed-out heart" feel slightly pre-packaged. The sheer density of metaphor and simile, particularly in moments of high action, slightly dulls the propulsion, preventing a flawless score, but the piece remains exceptionally polished.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the final paragraphs engage in slight conceptual redundancy, restating the central discovery in three different ways ("it doesn’t," "he’d endured every millisecond," "mind’s cruel amplifier"). This repetition, while thematically powerful, slightly dulls the sharp edge of the final beat and constitutes a minor paraphrase loop, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it suffers from a pattern of thematic keyword repetition ("scandalize," "contraband truths," "dizzying quiet"). While this creates a certain sense of cohesion, it also feels mechanical, like a scaffold that should have been removed. This recurring phrasing dulls the momentum slightly and feels less organic than the surrounding prose.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery ("clawed at a dust-choked sky"). The rhythm is controlled, creating a sense of deliberate calm that mirrors the protagonist's actions. The piece is marred only by a few instances of conceptual language that feels slightly less grounded than the surrounding prose, such as "inculcating plants with values," which abstracts an otherwise concrete and sensory world. The final sentences also lean toward summarizing the story's meaning, a minor but noticeable scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating both precision and lyricism without becoming overwritten. Information density is high, with sentences that consistently advance character, atmosphere, and action. Figurative language during peak beats, like "shards of shattered sound" and a "net of woven silence," is both original and clarifying, a rare achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and high information density. However, the density of figurative language in the opening paragraph ("velvet sky," "orbits of regret," "satellite trapped in decaying orbit," "tasted like ash," "tightening like a noose") borders on overwriting. Additionally, the line "Her heart hammered, not with doubt, but with the clean thrill of logic dismantling deceit" uses a summary label for an emotion that could have been shown more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is often lyrical and precise, with strong, evocative phrases like "meteor hush" and "haunted firmware." There is a slight tendency towards overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that occasionally slows momentum. The line "The firmware translated baby cries, filtering the dissonance into something recognizable: pure, terrified sorrow" is a moment of telling where showing would have been more powerful. Overall, the line-level craft is strong but could benefit from more restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, particularly in its sensory descriptions. However, it is weakened by moments of conceptual redundancy and scaffolding. Phrases like "This was her interjection—a silent message that the mess held meaning" and "The sand mandala had interjected hope where despair threatened" restate what the action has already shown. These small loops slightly dilute the momentum and power of the climax, preventing the prose from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally demonstrates high information density. The rhythm and syntax support the story's deliberate, searching pace. The primary weakness is a slight tendency toward conceptual redundancy, where adjacent phrases or clauses restate a similar idea in different words (e.g., "protecting fragile memories within unyielding resolve" echoes "cradle empathy in arms of steel"), which momentarily slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density and strong rhythm. However, the figurative language is occasionally so dense, particularly in the opening, that it borders on overwriting ("synesthetically blessed with the ability to taste the metallic tang of fractured seconds and hear the visual shimmer of overlapping realities as discordant chimes"). While the voice is consistent, a slightly more restrained hand would heighten the impact of the most crucial images.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and dense, particularly in its opening descriptions, which create immediate atmosphere and character. Word choice is precise, and the sentence structure varies to create a compelling rhythm. A minor deduction is warranted for a few stock phrases ("spark igniting in his weary eyes") and the slightly abstract, elevated language of the final paragraph. While beautiful, this final cluster of figurative language slightly reduces the raw immediacy of the breakthrough moment, keeping the prose just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, particularly in the opening descriptions. Sentences are generally concise and purposeful. There are minor instances of clichéd phrasing ("panic clawed at her throat") and a slight tendency toward labeling in the description of the heatmap ("deep blue despair cresting into violent orange anxiety"), though the latter is justified by the technology. These are small blemishes on an otherwise polished and propulsive piece.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("Sunlight bled," "unearthed silence like frozen breath"). The sentence structure is varied and propulsive. There are no technical flaws. The only minor weakness is that a few sentences in the final third function more as thematic summaries than forward-moving prose, slightly slowing the momentum before the final image. This prevents a higher score but does not significantly detract from the otherwise exceptional line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm that builds tension effectively. Sentences are generally dense with purpose, advancing plot, character, and mood simultaneously. The piece loses some points for occasional writerly phrases ("prudently daring") and for sentences that summarize thematic takeaways instead of trusting the images to do the work, particularly near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is luminous and controlled, with a strong rhythm and precise imagery. However, there are a few instances of overwriting where abstract, conceptual language clashes with the grounded, sensory detail. Phrases like "percolate through ambient awareness" and "distill its failing strength into a single point of reinforced truth" feel slightly academic and disrupt the otherwise seamless flow. While the overall quality is very high, these moments represent a minor but distinct friction.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, the momentum is occasionally slowed by a tendency to paraphrase or explain the significance of an image immediately after presenting it. For example, the discovery of the glass is followed by the assertion "This glass, he knew, was the heart of the oasis’s resistance." This scaffolding, while not pervasive, appears at key moments, slightly dulling the impact of the otherwise excellent line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates high craft, with strong verbs and varied syntax. However, the piece suffers from minor but noticeable repetition of key thematic tags, such as "wistfully pragmatic" and "quivering hush." While clearly intentional motifs, their recurrence slightly reduces momentum and creates a faint sense of being over-told, preventing the prose from achieving flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rich and evocative, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms. At times, however, the figurative language becomes so dense that it slightly hinders momentum, bordering on overwriting. While there are no clear errors like loops or scaffolds, the sheer weight of the descriptive prose occasionally feels labored, a hairline crack in an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and often striking, with high information density in its descriptions. There is a slight tendency towards overwriting, with a high concentration of adjectives and adverbs that can make some sentences feel overly lush. The final, long sentence, while grammatically sound, dilutes its impact by trying to summarize the entire resolution in one breath.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, propulsive, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in the opening. The line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence structures that match the story's pacing. However, a few moments of figurative language feel slightly overwrought or clichéd ("academic knives already unsheathed," "a spark of ethereal grit," "chart a banner of cautious hope"), which subtly detracts from the otherwise grounded and precise texture of the prose, especially near the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and a varied sentence rhythm. However, it occasionally tips into being overly dense, with a high frequency of figurative language that can feel slightly overwrought (e.g., "brittle silence hung heavy"). The final paragraph contains phrases that summarize the theme ("a temporary ceasefire in a war against entropy") rather than purely embodying it in image, which slightly dulls the otherwise powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often evocative and clear, with strong imagery in the opening. However, it is hampered by several text artifacts, including the self-conscious repetition of "furrowed hush" and abstract, thesis-like phrases like "unifying opposites." The final paragraph is an expository summary that stalls momentum and tells the reader the meaning of the events just witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally elegant and dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentence structure varies effectively to control rhythm. A minor but noticeable flaw is the repetition of key phrases ("spongey dread," "nervously confident"), which creates a slight paraphrase-loop effect that dulls the momentum in a couple of spots, preventing an otherwise excellent piece from reaching the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious, with moments of striking figurative language. However, it is hampered by distinct prose artifacts. The verbatim repetition of key phrases ("dynamically observant," "sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") acts as unnecessary scaffolding that disrupts momentum. This redundancy, combined with a close echo in "luminous disbelief" and "luminous glyph," signals a lack of polish that keeps the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. Phrases like "orange bled into bruised purple" are excellent. However, a few minor artifacts slightly dull the polish. The repetition of "perceptively calm" feels heavy-handed, and the final paragraphs contain some summary that feels like scaffolding ("The foreign bills in his satchel weren’t trophies; they were warnings"). While the line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, these moments of telling over showing slightly detract from its momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, particularly in the opening paragraphs. However, a few minor artifacts slightly dull the finish, such as the filter verb "felt" appearing twice in the final paragraph ("felt like a shared burden," "felt filled with the presence"). Additionally, a small handful of similes trend toward the familiar ("elusive as starlight," "intertwined like starlight and shadow"), holding the line-level craft just shy of flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally propulsive and clear, with strong verb choices. However, there are moments of overwriting where the density of figurative language feels strenuous, and minor prose artifacts like paraphrase loops appear ("warlike serenity, the calm of a soldier..."). These elements do not break the story's momentum but slightly reduce the polish and effortlessness of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often vivid, the prose suffers from distinct looping artifacts that dull its impact. Key phrases ("anxious elation," "purposefully curious," "the glade held its breath") are repeated verbatim, creating redundancy that a top-tier publication would immediately flag for revision. The high density of figurative language also occasionally borders on overwritten, impeding momentum in an otherwise well-paced piece.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose demonstrates high information density and strong sentence-level propulsion. Word choice is precise and evocative ("grave-mold," "festered in the marrow"). While the figurative language is dense, it remains coherent and serves the heightened, gothic atmosphere without becoming overwrought or obscuring clarity. The piece is free of noticeable scaffolding, loops, or repetitive sentence structures, resulting in a polished and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative. From the opening sentence, the language works hard, combining concrete sensory detail with sharp figurative language ("snagging on his skin like forgotten static," "Public failure tasted like chalk and shame"). The sentences have a varied rhythm that propels the narrative forward, and there is no evidence of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting. Every word serves to advance character, atmosphere, or the story's central realization.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its specific, evocative descriptions. While the overall craft is very strong, a few minor, common constructions ("Tears traced warm paths," "as if tending a fragile child") slightly soften the otherwise sharp and original line-level execution, holding it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and imagistic, with strong verbs and specific details. However, the density of figurative language is occasionally overwhelming, with multiple powerful metaphors clustered in short succession, which can slightly blunt their individual impact. While rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, a few moments of high-concept description feel more ornate than necessary, briefly slowing momentum. There are no technical flaws, but a more selective use of metaphor would elevate the craft further.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious but consistently overwritten, with figurative language and modifiers stacked so densely that they impede momentum. There are several instances of paraphrase-loops, where adjacent sentences restate the same idea with different synonyms ("captured, concentrated, *acquired*"). While grammatically clean, the lack of concision and the tendency toward ornate phrasing dull the impact of key moments, particularly the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is often lyrical but is marred by noticeable repetition and text artifacts. Key phrases ("daringly methodical," "raw solace," "alluded to") are reused to the point of becoming a distracting template cadence. While individual sentences are strong, this looping quality creates a scaffold-like structure that dulls momentum and makes the writing feel less organic and more constructed.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and precise for the most part, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, a few minor artifacts slightly dull the momentum. The phrase "cautious exuberance" is repeated, and there is a small paraphrase loop ("The cipher was accelerating... the reversal was tightening") that states the same idea twice. These are minor slips in an otherwise polished piece, but they prevent a top-tier score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. However, the figurative language occasionally becomes overwrought, bordering on overwritten in high-pressure moments ("mulberry ache of unfinished history," "balancing a snowflake on a sword’s edge"). The momentum is strong, and there are no major clarity issues, but a lighter touch would have sharpened the impact without sacrificing the lyrical quality.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong, purposeful imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the story's mounting tension and solemnity beautifully. A deduction is applied for the final two sentences, which lapse into summary ("She had not saved the world, but she had preserved its soul..."). This moment of telling slightly dulls the impact of the final, potent image, representing a minor prose artifact at the story's crucial closure point.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery that brings the fantastical world to life. Sentence structure is varied, and the rhythm supports the story's quiet, deliberate momentum. Minor instances of scaffolding appear, such as "Determined to clarify her thoughts," which tells rather than shows, but these moments are infrequent and do not significantly detract from the overall high quality of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and demonstrates high information density. However, it occasionally suffers from overwriting, with figurative language sometimes layered too thickly, creating conceptual redundancy. Phrases like "sincerely insincere—projecting calm certainty while feeling utterly adrift" or "unhooking the cloak wasn’t removal; it was surrender" state their own logic rather than letting the image do the work, a minor but persistent artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong imagery and a compelling rhythm. Line-level execution is largely clean and propulsive. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score, specifically a few small paraphrase loops where adjacent phrases restate the same idea in different words (e.g., withholding the core to let understanding bloom, followed by silence as a vessel for delayed revelation), which momentarily stalls the otherwise excellent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently lyrical and evocative, with a strong, rhythmic cadence and high information density. However, there are a few instances where the narration explains its own potent imagery, such as "This arrowhead was no ordinary tool." These minor moments of telling slightly blunt the force of the showing, constituting a small drag on an otherwise masterful line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often lyrical and evocative, but it suffers from overwriting and repetition that dulls its impact, particularly around the climax. The word "luminance" and descriptions of the glow appear excessively, and the conceptual phrase "accommodated impossibilities" is repeated verbatim, creating a prose artifact. This density of figurative language and conceptual looping in key moments slows momentum and slightly obscures the clarity of the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lyrical and often beautiful, with phrases like "meteor hush" and "liquid twilight" landing with precision. However, it occasionally slips into over-explanation, such as the line "the luminous text signified sound made visible," which states the discovery too directly. A few instances of adjectival density and near-redundancy ("deliberate yet fluid") slightly blunt the otherwise sharp momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, concise, and often elegant, with strong verbs and purposeful metaphors. However, minor prose artifacts are present, specifically the repetition of key phrases like "stellar doubt" and "quiet enthusiasm." In a story of this length, such repetitions stand out and slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level execution, representing a small but noticeable seam.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and ambitious, with many striking images. However, it occasionally slips into conceptual redundancy. The line "...steeped in distant intimacy—the closeness of shared purpose across the veil, the distance of forever" is a paraphrase loop that explains the preceding, stronger phrase. This slight overwriting in a few spots is the only friction in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with high information density in nearly every line. Figurative language, such as the viaduct as a "crystalline artery" and the riverbeds "cracking like old pottery," is fresh and integral to the world-building, not merely decorative. The climax is handled with particular skill, describing the magical repair not with a "flash, but a sigh," a choice that reinforces both character and theme. The sentences are varied and propulsive, showing no signs of scaffolding or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and polished, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, a minor but noticeable template cadence emerges ("Clutching...," "Following...," "Kneeling..."), creating a slightly predictable syntactic pattern. Additionally, a few phrases like "struck her like a physical blow" lean on familiar constructions, which slightly detract from the otherwise high quality of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but it suffers from a consistent overwriting issue. Figurative language is stacked too densely, particularly in the opening and climax ("liquid prism scattered dawn into emerald and sapphire shards, bathing ancient apple trees in an aura of ancient freshness"). This density sometimes slows momentum and clutters the imagery. Additionally, there are minor paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea, such as the relationship between logic and intuition near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from significant overwriting and conceptual looping. Thematic keywords ("burden," "trust," "revise," "soundless") are repeated to the point of diminishing returns. The density of figurative language in high-action beats ("muscle memory became her scripture," "midnight revision of falling stars") feels performative and slows momentum, a clear prose artifact that dulls the story's visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is mostly clean and effective, but the final third loses momentum by shifting from concrete action to abstract summary. The last few paragraphs are laden with conceptual nouns ("connection," "control," "ownership," "empathy") that stall the narrative drive. This issue, combined with occasional clichés ("slicing through pretense with surgical precision"), keeps the line-level craft from reaching an exceptional tier.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally clean and often evocative, but it is weakened by repetition and conceptual looping. The key phrases "safeguard space for innovation" and "hush of the possibility just born" are reused, diminishing their impact. The story also leans on abstract labels ("orthogonal approaches") and summary ("He was notably receptive") where more concrete dramatization would have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and rich with figurative language, achieving a high level of literary quality. While the sheer density occasionally borders on being overwritten, it largely serves the story's accumulative, textural goals without sacrificing clarity. The sentence structure is varied, the word choice is precise and evocative, and there are no technical flaws like loops or repetitive templates to slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently elegant, with high information density and varied sentence structure. Word choice is precise and evocative, creating a rich texture. The piece narrowly avoids a higher score due to the sheer density of its figurative language; in peak moments, the profusion of metaphors ("scraped frost into fragile constellations") occasionally threatens to prioritize lyricism over the sharp clarity of action, slightly softening the momentum of the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is largely elegant, dense, and propulsive. However, the line "when the penny drops—the precise, crystalline moment of understanding" introduces a clashing modern idiom that momentarily breaks the established tone. This phrase is a noticeable slip in an otherwise masterfully controlled piece. While the rest of the line-level craft is superb, with strong verbs and varied syntax, this artifact at a pivotal moment prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is vivid and often beautiful, but it's held back by noticeable artifacts. The phrase "serenely electric" is repeated three times, becoming a minor tic. Additionally, some explanatory sentences follow a repetitive template ("wasn't noise, but a language"; "wasn't absence, but a tangible, vibrating field"), slightly dulling the immediacy of discovery. These non-closure-harming issues prevent an otherwise high-quality prose from reaching its full potential.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose contains striking, memorable images like "clocks... spiraling like trapped moths." However, there are moments of slight imprecision and redundancy that hold it back. The repeated insistence on the labels "ardent" and "resiliently positive" feels heavy-handed, and a few sentences in the final third shift from showing to summarizing the emotional and thematic takeaway ("This was his duty, his home...").

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and specific imagery. The sentence-level craft is exceptional, modulating rhythm to match the story's "unsettling calm." A few phrases verge on being slightly overwritten or contain minor redundancies (e.g., "recollections were subtly rewriting themselves as memories altered"), but these are hairline slips that never impede the story's powerful momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and dense with well-chosen imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the contemplative yet forward-moving pace. A minor weakness is a tendency toward summary in the final paragraph, where the anchor link's symbolic journey is explained rather than allowed to simply resonate from its prior use. Lines like "had become a key to unfolded horizons" are slightly less powerful than the dramatized evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, with strong verbs and striking imagery. However, there is a recurring tendency toward overwriting, with dense figurative language sometimes blurring clarity rather than sharpening it ("residual pulses of unresolved emotion, the heartbeat of a soul refusing to fade"). This density, combined with the slightly summary-like tone of the ending, keeps the prose from achieving perfect propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong verbs and memorable images. However, a single sentence reads as a prose artifact: "The Codex margin illuminant gold fleck wasn’t mere decoration" feels clunky and slightly expository, as if directly inserting a required element. While the rest of the line-level craft is exceptional, this minor but noticeable seam in a pivotal moment prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong, specific imagery. Sentences are well-constructed and propel the narrative with a steady rhythm. The score is slightly capped by minor instances of paraphrase-loops, where a concept is stated and then immediately restated in more poetic terms (e.g., the sentences following "Her motivation was clear..."). While artful, these moments create a slight drag on momentum without adding new information.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and largely free of artifacts. Figurative language is deployed with purpose to build the world and atmosphere, rather than for mere ornamentation. Sentence structure is varied and propulsive, particularly in the climax, where the syntax mirrors the swirling, focused action. The story demonstrates high information density, with nearly every line serving character, plot, and tone simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("physics giggled," "a sound like chimes in a vacuum"). Momentum is well-maintained through varied sentence structures. The primary weakness is a tendency toward overwriting; the sheer density of figurative language can feel relentless, and a few moments rely on familiar phrasing like "cold knot in her chest" when the rest of the prose is so fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and dense with strong imagery, demonstrating high line-level craft. However, the repeated use of the phrase "resonantly soft" (four times) acts as a minor prose artifact, hammering a label where the effect is already clear. While a small flaw, this repetition slightly dulls the otherwise sharp execution, particularly as it touches the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is evocative and dense, but its momentum is slightly hampered by patterned repetition. The phrase "brittle hush" appears four times, and "fragile" appears four times, which moves from a motif to a noticeable prose artifact in a story of this length. While stylistically deliberate, this recurrence slightly dulls the impact and prevents an otherwise stellar piece from achieving flawless line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The rhythm is well-controlled, slowing for description and quickening with the chiming bells. A notable prose artifact is the heavy repetition of key phrases—"misting hush," "whispering gleam," "quiet persistence"—which, while clearly intentional, functions like a template cadence that slightly dulls the impact and feels overly insistent in such a short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and highly polished, with many memorable phrases ("calculus and verse," "a language of angles and sorrow"). The sentence structure is varied and propulsive. A minor deduction is warranted for a slight tendency toward over-description in a few spots, where figurative language is layered so densely it momentarily slows the pace rather than sharpens the image, as when the scarf's meaning is heavily front-loaded in a single complex sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and packed with memorable imagery. However, two minor but distinct grammatical errors—"she must paints with light" and "began vitalize the cipher"—are jarring in an otherwise polished piece, preventing a higher score. While the high density of figurative language mostly works, these small slips slightly undermine the craft at a line level, which would be an immediate flag for a copy-editor.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose contains moments of stunning beauty, particularly in its imagery ("a silver needle stitching earth to sky"). However, it suffers from a pervasive density; figurative language is so heavily stacked that it occasionally clogs momentum and feels overwritten. The ending also contains paraphrase loops, restating the central theme in slightly different ways, which dulls the impact of the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with strong verbs and evocative, consistent figurative language ("serpent's spine," "broken promise"). The rhythm is well-controlled, matching the pacing of the underwater scene. The only slight hesitation is the sheer density of metaphors in places, which borders on overwriting but ultimately remains controlled and purposeful, contributing to the rich atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with a strong, varied rhythm. However, a minor but noticeable pattern of conceptual summary slightly dulls the immediacy in a few key moments. Phrases like "her brutality masked a fierce desire" or "tender as a bandage on a wound" lean toward telling rather than showing the established dynamic. While the overall quality is high, these small instances of over-articulation prevent it from reaching the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied and controlled, creating the story's "radiant hush." There is a slight tendency towards overwriting, with a high density of figurative language and abstract nouns ("emotional heartbeat," "color's emotional heartbeat") that occasionally borders on the ethereal at the expense of concrete clarity. The repetition of "radiant hush" feels like a minor crutch.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is consistently elevated and often beautiful, but it suffers from a high density of figurative language that verges on overwriting. In key moments of pressure, the elaborate descriptions can slightly blunt the visceral impact rather than sharpen it. While individual sentences are strong, their cumulative effect creates a uniform texture that lacks rhythmic variety, and the conceptual language ("physical manifestation of the ocean's indifference") can feel heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and almost entirely free of artifacts. Figurative language, like "bled saints into ghosts" and "a vault door slightly ajar," is potent and purposeful, establishing tone and character without overwriting. Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm that carries the reader forward. While the final sentence ("frescoes weeping with the weight of understood secrets") verges on purple prose, it lands as an earned, emotionally resonant flourish in the context of the story's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the melancholic, analytical tone. Minor weakness appears in moments of thematic summary, such as the line cataloging the *Athenia* and Earhart's flight as "artifacts of suspended moments," which feels like explanatory scaffolding rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong sensory details and a controlled rhythm. However, a few minor artifacts prevent it from reaching the highest tier. The repeated compound noun "Tinkersong wonder" and the summary phrase "Her motivation crystallized" are small instances of telling that slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are well-paced, mirroring the steady ascent of the elevator and the quickening pace of discovery. A few minor instances of stock phrasing ("heart quickening") and a final sentence that summarizes the theme slightly weaken an otherwise polished piece, but the line-level craft remains very high.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lyrical and often beautiful, but tips into overwriting in several key moments, particularly near the climax. Phrases like "gilding her journal pages with ancient luminescence, as if the cosmos itself bore witness" feel overwrought. The final two paragraphs shift from scene to summary, which stalls the powerful momentum built throughout the story.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmic, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("a perfect, impossible mirror bloomed"). The sentence structure varies to control pace effectively, matching the "heightened stillness." A minor deduction is for a slight over-densification of conceptual adjectives in a few phrases, which momentarily slows the otherwise superb momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and clear, with varied sentence rhythms that serve the story's momentum. However, its high figurative density borders on overwriting, especially the stacked metaphors in the opening. Minor authorial artifacts, such as the direct repetition of the key phrase "diligently curious," slightly mar the otherwise strong craft and momentarily reveal the story's seams.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is rich and dense with figurative language, yet remains remarkably clear and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery ("chisel bit," "sky bled," "frost ferns"). While the density of metaphor is consistently high, it rarely feels overwritten, instead contributing to the story's unique, dreamlike atmosphere. There are no notable loops or scaffolding; every sentence carries weight and pushes the narrative forward with rhythmic grace.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, clear, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, a minor prose artifact appears mid-story with the sentence, "this spectral guide, this altruistic ghost, seemed solely motivated to orchestrate their collective effort for survival," which summarizes motivation that has already been effectively shown. This small redundancy slightly dulls the momentum in an otherwise stellar piece of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, but occasionally tips into dense, abstract phrasing ("nested patterns woven into the lullaby’s very structure," "crossed temporal thresholds"). The line "radiant with purpose" is a minor cliché that momentarily softens the impact of Elias's transformation. While the overall effect is powerful, a few instances of overwriting prevent it from achieving flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean and propulsive, with strong imagery and precise language. Information density is high, particularly in the opening paragraph. The repetition of "offhandedly exact" (three times) feels like a deliberate motif but borders on a prose tic, creating a minor loop that could be refined. Otherwise, the line-level craft is sharp and effective, carrying the story's momentum without flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally elegant, clear, and propelled by strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there are minor but noticeable instances of conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops that slow the momentum. Lines like "energy repurposed, not lost" followed by "The empty chrysalis wasn’t a tomb; it was proof of emergence" restate the same idea in different words, a tic that slightly dulls the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense with evocative imagery, demonstrating high command of rhythm and syntax. While the high density of figurative language is a consistent stylistic choice, a minor repetition—"hollow... empty promises"—creates a slight clunkiness in an otherwise polished piece. The propulsion is excellent, carrying the reader through a complex internal journey with clarity and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong sensory details. However, there are minor scaffolding artifacts that prevent a higher score, such as the repetitive framing of "Her motivation..." which feels slightly mechanical. Phrasing like "emotionally contagious through touch" reads as a concept label rather than an organic description, creating a subtle break in the otherwise masterful line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("rust flaking like dried tears"). However, it occasionally strains for effect, resulting in overwriting. Phrases like "hush of borrowed starlight" and "sonic arches" feel self-consciously poetic, and the adjectival pairing "vigorous tender" is slightly awkward. These moments, while infrequent, create minor friction that slightly dulls the otherwise excellent craft.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    While often evocative, the prose is hampered by text artifacts that prevent it from reaching the highest tier. The repetition of "quaking reverie" and "chaotically precise" creates noticeable loops. Furthermore, the phrasing "chaotically imprecise yet devastatingly precise" is a clumsy construction that momentarily breaks the lyrical flow. These issues, while not fatal, demonstrate a need for a final polishing pass.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition and paraphrase loops that dull momentum. Key phrases ("clandestinely luminous," "seeds of vigilance," "latent blaze") are recycled multiple times, creating a text-artifact issue that makes the writing feel overwritten. While individual sentences are often lyrical, the overall effect is one of conceptual churn rather than clean, forward-moving craft.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery ("dewdrops fall like metronome ticks"). The line-level craft is very high, avoiding clichés and maintaining momentum. A slight deduction is warranted for a tendency towards complex, abstract descriptors in moments of high action ("symphonically minded soul maps the emerging melody"), which can feel slightly less immediate than the otherwise highly sensory and embodied descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally elegant and clear, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there are moments of conceptual redundancy that slightly slow the momentum, such as the repeated explanations of "translating silence." Some phrases, while beautiful, feel a bit too polished and abstract, creating a slight distance from the character's immediate sensory experience. These minor artifacts prevent the prose from reaching the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally polished and often beautiful, but it suffers from a high density of figurative language that can feel overwrought ("scalpel for dissecting silence," "petals unfolding like a night-blooming cereus"). This tendency toward overwriting culminates in the final sentence, which is an abstract summary that dulls the impact of the preceding concrete scene. It sacrifices a sharp, earned image for a vague, sentimental claim.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its density occasionally hinders momentum. There is a tendency towards overwriting, with figurative language layered so thickly it sometimes feels performative ("barnacles to a leviathan," "emerald crown of the world"). More critically, the final paragraph lapses into summarizing the theme, a form of scaffolding that tells the reader what has already been shown, dulling the impact of the otherwise powerful final image.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant, controlled, and evocative. However, the final two sentences shift from showing to telling, summarizing the outcome of the mission ("Her mission was complete; she had discovered the source..."). This piece of scaffolding slightly dulls the otherwise resonant closure, reading like an unnecessary explanation of what was already powerfully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is clean, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and specific imagery ("scattered like shrapnel," "amplified airflow into a blade"). There is a slight tendency towards abstract thematic phrasing, such as "cultivate foresight in action," which verges on telling rather than showing. However, this is a minor flaw in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece with excellent rhythm and zero momentum-killing artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant text-artifact issues, primarily paraphrase loops and repetitive phrasing. Core concepts like "oscillating repose," "sculpted hush," and "certified wonder" are repeated so frequently they lose their power and become incantatory filler. This robs the piece of momentum and creates a monotonous rhythm, dulling the impact of an otherwise imaginative concept.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong control, particularly in its use of metaphor ("peeling like sunburnt skin"). The central phrase "avalanchingly quiet" is a powerful, recurring motif. Minor deductions are for a few instances of slight conceptual paraphrase, where an idea is stated and then immediately explained, marginally slowing momentum in an otherwise propulsive piece.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, rhythmic variation, and precise, evocative language (“bled out,” “lucid turbulence,” “carved from light”). The prose is immaculate, free of artifacts or overwriting, and every sentence works to propel the narrative or deepen the atmosphere. The syntax itself mirrors the story's tension, shifting from measured observation to the feverish fragments of Aris's notebook sketches.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with a high degree of information and imagery packed into each sentence. While bordering on overwriting, it remains purposeful and controlled, creating a rich, immersive texture appropriate for the lyrical tone. There are no discernible loops, scaffold, or filler words; every phrase works to advance the story's atmosphere or Kael's internal state. The sentence structure varies effectively, propelling the reader through the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density with evocative, specific imagery ("laughter trapped near the base, sharp and bright as shattered glass"). The sentence structure is varied and propulsive. A few phrases verge on the familiar ("the world held its breath"), which keeps the piece just shy of utter flawlessness at the line level, but the overall craft is exceptionally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density and strong, evocative verbs. However, the opening paragraph borders on being overwritten, with a density of figurative language that slightly slows momentum ("actively *raveling*, swallowing sound and hope alike through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry"). While this density is a minor flaw and the prose clarifies for the climax, it prevents the story from reaching the highest tier in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, with strong, evocative imagery ("petrified rainbows," "trapped starlight"). However, it occasionally strays into being overwrought or relies on abstractions ("a chasm between understanding and confusion"). While the overall quality is very high, a few instances of slightly less precise language prevent it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates superb rhythmic control, especially in the climactic vision. While the majority of the writing is sharp and specific, a few phrases in the first half trend slightly towards being overwritten with dense figurative language (e.g., "humming with the murmur of half-remembered dreams"). This is a minor point in an otherwise stellar piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Word choice is precise and evocative, creating a rich texture without sacrificing momentum. A few instances of figurative language, such as "a soft, blue sorrow," feel slightly overwrought, momentarily pulling away from the otherwise grounded and potent style. The piece is free of technical artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, its very richness occasionally borders on overwriting, and the line "Panic clawed at her throat" is a familiar cliché in a key moment. The repetition of the phrase "shadowed elation" also constitutes a minor prose loop, preventing the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is often elegant, but it suffers from a tendency to overwrite and state its concepts directly rather than dramatizing them. Phrases like "...iridescent caution, a warning wrapped in allure, nature’s own dye recipe for survival" are redundant and feel like thematic scaffolding. This declarative style appears in several key moments, dulling the story's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative, with high information density ("its brass limbs splayed like a dead insect"). However, the final three paragraphs lose some momentum, shifting from dramatized action to reflective summary. Phrasing like "For in the quantification of sorrow, he'd found not emptiness, but a map to what endures" feels like authorial scaffolding explaining the theme, which slightly dulls the immediacy of the closure image. This prevents the piece from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense with imagery, demonstrating strong line-level craft and momentum. The rhythm and syntax support the story's incantatory feel. A handful of phrases lean towards familiar fantasy conventions ("dying embers," "lifeline cast into the dark"), which slightly tempers the otherwise excellent and specific language.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and often evocative, with strong verbs and clear imagery. However, a few phrases like "Enlarged tranquility settled over her" and "a vessel holding possibility" lean into abstraction where a more concrete, embodied description would be stronger. While minor, these moments slightly soften the otherwise sharp and immersive line-level craft, particularly when compared to the specificity elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and confident, with strong verbs and vivid imagery ("ivy strangled marble statues"). However, there are minor but noticeable prose artifacts that slightly dull its perfection. The repetition of specific, unusual phrases ("heuristically gentle," "tenuous absolution") feels mechanical, and the close echo of "sacred in its absence" / "sacred in their simplicity" shows a slight lack of variation in key moments, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently elegant and imagistic, with high information density. However, there are minor repetitive artifacts that slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution. The phrase "gently meticulous" is repeated, and key concepts like "luminous vows" and "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" are restated with very similar phrasing. While this creates a certain incantatory rhythm, it borders on scaffold-like reinforcement in a piece this short and dense.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with evocative imagery and varied sentence structure. However, it is marred by several prose artifacts that prevent it from reaching a higher tier. There are paraphrase loops and scaffolding, most notably the mechanical labeling of "False start number three" and the thrice-repeated "curiously steadfast." These elements feel like authorial scaffolding rather than seamless prose, slightly dulling the story's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently lyrical, dense, and precise. However, a few moments of slight over-explanation, such as "a physiological alarm triggered by the carriers’ approach," read more like authorial summary than Aris's immediate thought process. While minor, these instances momentarily thin the voice and prevent a higher score, though they do not affect the clarity or power of the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, the opening paragraph is dense with figurative language ("auroral sorrow," "weeping shadows," "a tomb," "strangled her art"), bordering on overwriting. While the style is consistent, this initial density creates slight friction that momentarily slows the otherwise excellent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished and dense with memorable, specific imagery like "cracked like old bones" and "spine softening like sun-scorched celery." Sentences are propulsive and purposeful, with a strong rhythm that carries the reader through the narrative. There are no notable prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; the execution is clean and professional.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and imagistically rich, with high information density in most sentences. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, creating a powerful atmosphere. The score is tempered by a few instances of scaffolding that tell rather than show ("The symphony had done its work"), which, while brief, slightly interrupt the momentum and immersive quality of the otherwise excellent line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. However, a few moments in the climax resort to a list-like, template cadence that slightly flattens the rhythm. The line "The tear began to glow, the circuit board vibrating, the glass shard humming" is functional but lacks the propulsion and texture of the surrounding prose, constituting a minor artifact in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean but leans on sentimental clichés ("tarnished edge," "forgotten sorrow," "tapestry of memory," "fraying edges of despair"). The final paragraphs exhibit a template-cadence run, with several sentences starting with similar structures, which flattens the rhythm and reads like a summary. While grammatically sound, the line-level craft lacks the precision and originality to escape a sense of manufactured emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, marked by strong verbs and vivid, specific imagery. However, its relentless density of figurative language occasionally feels overwritten, with complex metaphors stacked in nearly every sentence, which can slightly dull the momentum of high-pressure beats. Several key moments are articulated as polished aphorisms, which, while thematically resonant, can break the immediacy of the scene by sounding more like retrospective summary than in-the-moment thought.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and often stunning, with high information density in its imagery. Lines like "the town drowned in gleaming silence" and "reality thinned like worn fabric" demonstrate strong line-level craft. There are, however, minor instances of overwriting and reliance on familiar phrasing ("hollow ache," "heart brimming with light") that slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution. While the overall quality is very high, these moments of slight imprecision prevent a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it carries minor, recurring artifacts. The phrase "terrestrially cosmic" is repeated three times, feeling more like a thematic label than an organic description by the third use, and a few phrases like "tranquil blaze... calm fire" create minor paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is polished and highly effective, with strong verbs and evocative, specific imagery. Sentences like "The lie was the language. The truth was the looking" demonstrate exceptional concision and thematic density. While the prose is consistently beautiful, a few phrases occasionally feel slightly too composed ("cosmic spectacle"), a hairline flaw in an otherwise impeccable piece. There are no loops, redundancies, or momentum-draining artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose is often evocative, it is significantly hampered by repetition and paraphrase loops that dull momentum, particularly at the end. The phrase "last star...fading into morning light" is used three times in quick succession, and two adjacent sentences restate the protagonist's emotional shift ("hollow" vs. "anchored," "emptiness" vs. "independence"). These artifacts constitute a notable flaw that weakens the otherwise strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is superb, with precise word choice and evocative imagery that creates high information density. Sentences are constructed with a varied, elegant rhythm that propels the quiet narrative forward. A minor note of caution lies in the repeated use of certain key phrases like "pearl twilight," which, while clearly motivic, border on stylistic indulgence; however, the overall effect remains powerful and the prose is free of any true artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting and repetition. Several key phrases ("webs of intrigue," "progressive disclosure," "reed-blown melancholy") are repeated almost verbatim, functioning like scaffolding. The density of figurative language, while often beautiful, occasionally muddles clarity and slows momentum, particularly with stacked similes that don't always deepen the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong, evocative imagery ("cloudy amber tear," "piano wire, snapping taut"). However, the momentum is slightly dulled in the final paragraphs by sentences that summarize the story’s effect rather than letting the final image do the work (e.g., "The ghosts below would rest easier now, their secret exposed..."). This explanatory impulse is the primary weakness in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The sentence and paragraph structure create a contemplative rhythm that supports the story's mood. A handful of phrases lean toward telling rather than showing the theme ("This was the hidden effort of the fortress itself..."), and the adverb "scintillatingly" feels slightly ornate. These are very minor imperfections in an otherwise beautifully crafted piece that prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is a model of economy and precision, with high information density in every sentence. Word choice is consistently strong and evocative ("ochre clouds," "irradiated gravel," "deliberate architecture of their suffering") without tipping into overwriting. The rhythm and syntax support the story's momentum, remaining clear and propulsive even when conveying complex information. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no discernible loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles, even in its peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative and dense with powerful imagery, demonstrating strong line-level craft and momentum. However, the figurative language is occasionally overwrought, and the repetition of the key phrase "lyrically prophetic" three times feels slightly heavy. While the propulsion is excellent, a final polish for concision would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmic, but there are minor recurring artifacts that slightly mar the finish. The repetition of "positively wistful" and the triple use of "sweetened" in key moments feel heavy-handed. Phrases like "Gleaned redemption" are also a touch too abstract and authorial, momentarily breaking the otherwise immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often lands with vivid imagery ("azure coat flapping like a wounded bird"). However, it suffers from overwriting in several key moments, with dense clusters of adjectives and adverbs. There are also minor paraphrase loops, such as "His adaptation wasn't guesswork; it was precise vibrational matching," which state the same idea twice. These artifacts slightly blunt the story's momentum, particularly during the high-stakes climax.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lyrical, controlled, and often beautiful, with a strong sense of rhythm. However, it is laden with such a high density of figurative language that it occasionally feels overwrought, slightly blunting the narrative's momentum. There are minor instances of repetitive phrasing (e.g., "softly purposeful" used twice as a key descriptor). The line-level craft is highly skilled, but a touch more restraint would have amplified its power.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density in most lines. Minor repetition of phrases like "empirical observation" and a few slightly common constructions ("motivation crystallized") are the only elements keeping it from perfection. Otherwise, the word choice is precise and the rhythm is impeccable, especially in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the story suffers from a distinct pattern of thematic keyword repetition ("vibrant hush," "aptly deliberate," "calm before realization," "light breaks through storm clouds"). While initially effective, the recurrence of these exact phrases in such a short piece feels overly deliberate, like authorial scaffolding, which slightly dulls the momentum and subtracts from the overall polish.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is dense, lyrical, and propelled by strong verbs and specific imagery ("wiped acid-scarred hands on grease-stained overalls"). The prose is clean, with no discernible loops or scaffolding, and sentence structure varies to match the rhythm of the action. While the conceptual language is ambitious, it remains clear and purposeful, contributing to the story's unique texture without becoming overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and maintains momentum effectively. However, it leans on several well-worn genre phrases ("sterile glow," "digital echo," "ghost in the machine," "laser-bright") that slightly dull its edge. While these don't break immersion, their frequency prevents the line-level craft from feeling truly exceptional or surprising. The core mechanics are solid, but the surface lacks polish.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is evocative but burdened by a few artifacts that reduce momentum, particularly in the final third. The high density of figurative language occasionally feels overwrought, and thematic summary phrases like "This was the courageous anomaly" tell the reader what to feel. These elements slightly dull the impact of an otherwise strong and rhythmic piece.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, marked by strong verbs and memorable figurative language. However, a minor but noticeable paraphrase loop occurs around the protagonist's motivation ("...no longer to end her pain, but to learn the sound..." is re-stated almost identically as "Her motivation crystallized: not to flee the sound, but to learn its language..."). This slight redundancy momentarily dulls the impact of her pivotal realization, preventing an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with high information density in its imagery. However, there are minor but noticeable instances of scaffolding and register drift that briefly stall momentum. Phrases like "Gently persuasive, her mind began its quiet work, not forcing meaning, but inviting it," feel like authorial narration of a process rather than the process itself, creating a slight drag on an otherwise propulsive and evocative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, the density of figurative language and conceptual nouns ("kinetic parapet," "inherent entropy," "living resonance") occasionally verges on being overwritten, slightly cluttering peak moments. While there are no technical errors or loops, a more restrained hand in a few key sentences could have heightened the propulsion and clarity even further.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, particularly in its descriptive passages. Sentences are well-crafted and information-dense. However, a few instances of overwriting and abstraction slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution. Phrases like "a masterpiece of collective healing" and "the gentle, earnest whimsy of roots breaking stone" feel less concrete and more like authorial summary, preventing the prose from achieving flawless transparency.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it is hampered by moments of overwriting and abstraction that slightly dull the immediacy of key beats. Phrases like "the weight of witnessing something sacred" and the clunky construction around "her weathered innocence" are instances of telling the significance rather than letting the concrete action carry the meaning, creating minor but noticeable drag.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by dense, evocative imagery and a powerful, varied rhythm. Figurative language ("driftwood bones arched like whale ribs," "bled tomorrow dry") is consistently strong and integrated, never feeling ornamental. The sentences propel the narrative forward with clarity and poetic force, and the final paragraph provides a perfect, cyclical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with a controlled rhythm. However, it suffers from minor but noticeable flaws. The opening contains a paraphrase loop ("foundations shook... foundations shaking"), and the epiphany sentence ("escape velocity wasn’t about...") reads more like a thematic thesis than an organic thought. The high figurative density, while often effective, occasionally feels overwrought, slightly impeding momentum in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and purposeful, with high information density. However, there are minor instances of overwriting where figurative language becomes slightly dense or redundant, such as describing her presence as both a "pulsing stillness" and a "deep, resonant calm that vibrated." These moments, while infrequent, momentarily soften the otherwise sharp and evocative prose, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely clear, concise, and rhythmically effective, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a few moments of conceptual summary, such as "This wasn't brute force; it was a dialogue with failure," function as minor scaffolding that tells the reader the theme rather than letting the action carry it alone. This slight tendency to explain the process, while not egregious, holds the line-level craft back from the highest tier of seamless integration.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often elegant and precise, with strong imagery like a "worldview fractured like dropped porcelain." However, there are notable moments of overwriting where the language becomes overly abstract or meta. Phrases like "nostalgic innovation" and "mapping errors into guiding stars" feel like authorial labels rather than organic character thoughts. This register drift into thematic summary dulls the immediacy of key beats, constituting a prose artifact that prevents the piece from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, but its high density of figurative language occasionally verges on overwriting. A more significant flaw is the verbatim repetition of the clauses "as memories resurface" and "reflectively vibrant." These repetitions read as unpolished scaffolding rather than intentional motifs, creating a minor but noticeable artifact that slightly dulls an otherwise luminous piece.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwriting in places, with dense clusters of figurative language that occasionally slow momentum. The line "this was the universe whispering" is a conceptual cliché that explains the epiphany rather than letting the image do the work. The repetition of "honeyed hush" and a tendency to state the meaning of a metaphor ("like memories settling into place") are minor but persistent prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with no wasted words or motion. Figurative language is consistently striking yet precise, such as hope being a "jagged shard of silver light" or laughter "thin as spider silk," enhancing atmosphere without overwriting. The sentence structure and rhythm are varied and controlled, creating a "swirling hush" on the page itself that mirrors the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery. However, it borders on being overwritten; the density of figurative language ("dawn bled peach and lavender," "dewdrops caught fire") is relentless, slightly dulling the impact of individual images. While rhythm and sentence structure are varied and propulsive, a touch more restraint in the descriptive passages would heighten the power of the key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by its rhythmic precision and high information density. Sentences like "The sun was a black coin rimmed with fire" perform immense atmospheric and narrative work with concision. While a phrase like "wax of frozen tears" borders on the overly poetic, it remains coherent within the story's magical-realist framework and does not detract from the otherwise flawless line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of a very high caliber, characterized by its density, clarity, and rhythmic control. Figurative language, such as "gears like frozen leaves, springs coiled in defeat," is evocative without becoming overwrought, consistently serving character and atmosphere. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or syntactic monotony; every sentence works to propel the narrative forward, making for a lean and powerful read. The line-level craft is impeccable.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density and strong verbs. However, it occasionally tips into overwriting, with a density of figurative language that can feel slightly relentless. The repetition of key phrases like "boundary-lessly trapped" and "whalebone reverie," while thematic, borders on becoming a stylistic tic that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often lyrical and evocative, particularly in its sensory details. However, it suffers from several distinct prose artifacts that drag it down. There are paraphrase loops ("emptiness echoed the void") and conceptual redundancies ("harvest lessons from loss," "Each stroke harvested a lesson"). The direct thematic statements discussed in Q5 also function as a form of telling that dulls the momentum of an otherwise well-paced scene.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    While often evocative, the prose suffers from a tendency toward overwriting, with a very high density of figurative language that can blunt the impact of individual images. There are minor instances of paraphrase loops ("shattered frame... skeletal ring") and a reliance on abstract emotional labels in key moments. The ambition is commendable, but a more restrained hand would increase momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, precise, and largely excellent, with strong verbs and specific imagery. Momentum is well-maintained, and the information density is high. The score is held back by minor, but noticeable, instances of conceptual redundancy, such as repeating the idea of "redirected flows" in slightly different phrasing. A final polish to eliminate these near-duplicate beats would make the prose flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is often beautiful and precise, it is marred by significant repetition of key phrases. "Glacial hush" appears four times, and "excruciatingly gentle" and "petrichor nostalgia" appear three times each. While this creates a hypnotic, incantatory effect that aligns with the story's mood, its frequency crosses the line from motif into a noticeable prose artifact. This pattern measurably dulls the unique impact of each instance, creating a loop that slightly drags the momentum and prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, but it is significantly weakened by conceptual repetition. Phrases like "hindsight clarity," "thoughtfully clear," and "architecture of lies" are reused to the point of becoming prose artifacts, creating paraphrase loops that dull the impact of the initial revelation. This redundancy, a form of telling what has already been shown, is the story's most notable flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and demonstrates a strong command of rhythm and syntax. However, it occasionally suffers from a high density of figurative language, with numerous similes and metaphors that, while individually effective, feel slightly crowded in such a short piece. A minor paraphrase loop ("coax the patterns into revelation, to hear what the weavers had buried") also slightly impedes the otherwise excellent forward momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and evocative, specific imagery ("vein of frozen blood," "leaves swirling...like unanswered prayers"). While highly figurative, the language rarely feels overwritten, instead contributing to the story's potent atmosphere and Elara's unique worldview. There are no loops or scaffold; every sentence carries weight, advancing character or theme with remarkable efficiency and clarity, even in its most poetic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is rich, dense, and evocative, with powerful imagery and varied sentence rhythms. However, there are minor blemishes that prevent a higher score. The repetition of "bitterly sweet" in the same paragraph and the reuse of the phrase "quaking reverie" feel like slight authorial tics rather than deliberate motifs. While the language is overwhelmingly strong, these small redundancies slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a high density of figurative language that verges on overwriting. Phrases like "ground starlight" and "liquid night" are evocative but, when stacked so closely, can slightly diminish the story's raw, grounded feel. The prose propulsion is strong, but a more selective use of metaphor in peak moments would have amplified their power.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich with imagery and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, there are moments of overwriting and a minor template cadence ("This was the first breadcrumb," "This was the heart of the trap") that slightly dulls the propulsion. Some figurative language, like "psychic sludge," feels like a register shift that clashes with the more timeless, lyrical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose contains striking imagery but is undermined by significant line-level artifacts. The verbatim repetition of the phrase "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" and the reuse of "troubling serenity" create noticeable loops that dull momentum. These repetitions feel like an oversight in a piece striving for lyrical perfection and would require revision before publication.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is of a very high caliber, characterized by dense, evocative imagery and strong rhythmic control. There are, however, minor flaws: the phrase "fiercely meditative" is repeated, and a few images verge on the familiar ("catching like burrs in his throat"). These are hairline imperfections in an otherwise immaculate surface, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and largely successful, with strong verbs and evocative, concrete imagery. The rhythm is controlled, varying with the scene's emotional tempo. While the figurative language is occasionally very rich ("glittered like frozen midnight"), it mostly avoids tipping into overwriting. There are no loops or structural artifacts, and information density is high. The piece is impeccably clean, though its very density requires significant reader engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense, but marred by minor repetitions that a top-tier publication would flag. The adjective "velveteen" is used to describe both the sky and the gloom, and "tenderly organized" describes both her precision and her movements, slightly dulling the effect. These minor lexical loops, while not damaging causality, prevent the otherwise excellent prose from achieving flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    While many lines are evocative and precise ("The obsidian spire pierced the iron-gray sky"), the prose is hampered by abstract, jargon-like phrases that break the tone, such as "groundedly imaginative predictive modeling." Furthermore, the piece suffers from conceptual redundancy, repeatedly stating the theme in slightly different ways. These loops, while not syntactic, create momentum drag and feel like scaffolding rather than seamless prose.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of a very high caliber, with high information density and a controlled, musical rhythm. Figurative language ("thistled calm," "inert as forgotten commas") is fresh and serves the story's unique tone without becoming overwritten. The line-level craft is clean and propulsive, with no discernible loops or scaffolding, even in the climactic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and sentences are well-constructed, but the story is marked by conceptual loops and repetitive phrasing. Core ideas ("mirage of safety," "incomplete information," "crystallizing emotion") are restated multiple times with only minor variations. This paraphrase-loop artifact creates a slight drag on momentum and reduces information density, particularly as it persists into the final third of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, dense, and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there is a minor paraphrase loop that slightly dulls momentum: "He agonized over the sedimentary layers... agonizing over every shift of silt." While the repetition of key phrases like "rationally rebellious" and "abrasive calm" feels mostly intentional as a character mantra, the prose could be tightened slightly to eliminate this small redundancy. Otherwise, the line-level craft is superb.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and often evocative, with strong sensory details. However, it occasionally slips into abstract or slightly academic phrasing ("the unlearning of hatred," "the shared language of empathy") that feels more like a label than a lived experience. The repetition of key phrases like "traveled stillness" and "expectantly resigned" functions as a minor prose artifact, a tic that could be refined for greater subtlety and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery. However, the repeated use of clinical, scientific jargon ("synaptic plasticity," "synaptic shift," "neural pathway") creates a jarring register drift. This artifact clashes with the story's otherwise magical and organic tone, feeling like an unnecessary and distracting explanation for the fantastical element.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong sensory details and a confident rhythm. The sentence structure is varied and propulsive. There are minor instances of scaffolding, such as the line "Preserving that wonder...was her anchor, her reason...", which explains motivation that is already evident through action, slightly slowing momentum near the end, but the overall craft is very high.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and striking images ("streetlights daydreamed," "hushed blaze"). However, there is a tendency toward over-writing, with a high density of figurative language that sometimes slows momentum. A sentence like "The contrast was stark, profound, yet she hadn’t sought it; it revealed itself inadvertently as she worked" reads as authorial scaffolding that could be trimmed for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and clear, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences like "Stone knitted itself, coral bloomed brighter, and the garden exhaled a cloud of silt that settled like forgiveness" demonstrate high craft. The score is slightly tempered by a few phrases ("testament to the beauty of uncertainty embraced") that feel more like thematic summary than lived-in prose, slightly flattening the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with high information density and strong verbs. However, the final paragraph becomes slightly burdened by its conceptual weight, leading to a sequence of declarative statements that summarize the thematic shift rather than letting the final image do all the work. For instance, "the missed opportunity was no longer lost; it was the foundation he walked upon" is a powerful idea but is stated with an essayistic finality that slightly lessens the momentum built by the preceding scene-work.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lyrical and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery. The rhythm is well-paced, slowing for introspection and quickening with his mission. There are a few instances of slightly overwrought phrasing ("dawn’s false promise," "amnesiac haze") that, while tonally consistent, momentarily pull back from the story's grounded specificity. Overall, the line-level craft is very high, with no significant artifacts or momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with a strong, rhythmic cadence and high information density per line. Figurative language like "a silent scream against oblivion" is potent and well-placed. While the prose is overwhelmingly successful, a few phrases like "Panic, cold and sharp" verge on the familiar, representing a minor friction in an otherwise exceptional execution. There are no significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, in its pursuit of lyrical density, it occasionally tips into slight overwriting, with a few instances of near-paraphrasing that could be tightened. For example, "She wasn’t fixing time; she was tuning it" slightly restates the preceding idea of making the gears "sing," momentarily slowing the otherwise excellent momentum of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and vivid, specific imagery ("maggots writhing in moonlight"). Sentence structure varies effectively to control momentum, especially during the climax. There is a slight tendency toward overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that occasionally risks feeling labored rather than organic. The final paragraph, as noted elsewhere, slips into summary, which slightly dulls the propulsive clarity of the preceding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is ambitious and frequently stunning, with high information density. However, the reliance on a small set of specialized terms ("fractal generating," "sketched resonance," "dubbing") creates a slight template cadence through repetition. While thematic, this recurrence borders on a scaffold, preventing the line-level craft from feeling completely fluid and surprising throughout, particularly in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there are minor instances of redundancy that slightly dull the momentum. For example, the line "hope had curdled into a sunwashed dread, a pervasive, bleaching anxiety" contains two near-synonymous phrases, a small prose artifact that could be tightened. These are minor slips and do not touch the clean, effective prose of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, but held back by minor conceptual redundancies and moments of thematic summary. Phrases like "proving that even well-intentioned falsehoods could dig a pit" function as scaffolding, telling the reader an insight that the scene's imagery was already showing. These small loops prevent the line-level craft from being truly flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, but it is marred by significant repetition. Key phrases—"interlaced absence," "archeologist of abandoned dreams," "stoically sensitive," "wrested"—are used three times each, creating a looping, scaffold-like effect that feels mechanical. This artifact dulls the momentum and impact of otherwise strong writing, preventing the piece from reaching the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density. However, there is a recurring use of specific, somewhat ornate phrases ("reclaimed stillness," "tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") that borders on becoming a stylistic tic. While largely effective, this repetition slightly lessens the impact of each phrase upon its return, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and demonstrates high information density, with striking and purposeful imagery ("creasing grief into the next origami crane"). The craft is very strong, but a few instances of conceptual labeling, like the direct repetition of "Descends while ascending," feel slightly heavy-handed and prevent a 9+ score. Otherwise, the line-level execution is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong rhythm and sentence variety. However, there are minor but noticeable artifacts that prevent a higher score. The repetition of "intangibly tangible" is a conceptual loop that stands out. Additionally, a few phrases like "It wasn't memory; it was the potential *itself*..." act as scaffolding, explicitly telling the reader the nature of the discovery rather than allowing it to be fully conveyed through Aris's embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is ambitious, vivid, and generally very strong, with high information density. However, a slight tendency toward overwriting and the use of familiar literary metaphors ("bruised twilight," "fractured heart," "river of silver") in key moments slightly tempers its brilliance. While rhythm and clarity are excellent, a few phrases lack the sharp originality found elsewhere in the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with high information density and strong momentum. However, a couple of lines slightly undermine the overall craft by stating thematic significance directly, such as calling the watch hand "the physical manifestation of the withheld truth." While minor, these moments of telling rather than showing prevent a perfect score in an otherwise exceptional piece.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong word choice and varied sentence structure. Its primary weakness is conceptual looping; the story explains the symbolic meaning of the drawer pull and the theme of "recycling" mistakes more than once. This repetition, while thematically consistent, creates a slight drag on momentum and over-explains what the action already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    While many individual lines are evocative, the piece is significantly weakened by prose artifacts. The verbatim repetition of four key phrases ("backlash of regrets," "merrily melancholic," "flickering faith," "to align heart and action") creates a template cadence that dulls momentum. This looping feels like scaffold, a textual tic that calls attention to itself and detracts from the otherwise strong prose.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is largely clean, with evocative imagery and varied sentence structure creating good momentum. The main flaw is a paraphrase loop in the penultimate paragraph ("He hadn't just navigated... he'd chosen empathy..."), which summarizes the action and theme just dramatized. This scaffolding, combined with the final sentence's tidy simile, dulls the impact of the otherwise strong ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and imbued with strong sensory details, particularly in its descriptions of moonlight and scent. The sentence structure is varied and propulsive. A few phrases lean towards abstraction ("a silent, desperate pulse") or are slightly overwritten, but these are minor issues in an otherwise polished piece with high information density and zero textual artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and evocative, with many striking images. However, it occasionally tips into being overwritten, with a density of figurative language that can feel strenuous ("hummed with a silence so profound it pressed against her eardrums"). While beautiful, the sheer consistency of this elevated style slightly flattens the rhythm in peak moments, preventing it from achieving perfect propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with high information density and strong rhythm. However, there are a few instances of strategic telling that feel more like scaffolding, particularly the explicit definition of "shadow work" early on. While the figurative language is generally strong, a few moments of abstraction dull the immediacy of peak beats, preventing the prose from achieving flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose contains moments of genuine beauty and strong imagery ("a sound like silk brushing stone"). However, it suffers from a tendency toward overwriting, with dense clusters of figurative language ("mosaic of small, seismic shifts," "sacred thread in fate’s tapestry") that can feel abstract and slow momentum. Several sentences restate the same concept, creating minor conceptual loops that could be tightened for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, a few phrases lean towards cliché ("motivation burned steady") or abstraction ("a cloak for deeper purpose") where a more concrete image would be stronger. There's a minor paraphrase loop between the initial description of the silent revolution and the final line, which slightly dilutes the impact of the otherwise stellar ending. These are minor flaws in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong imagery. However, a few moments prevent a higher score, including a slightly on-the-nose simile ("despair coiled in his chest like a trapped eel"). More significantly, the final paragraphs contain paraphrase loops that restate the story’s thematic resolution, slightly reducing the momentum and density of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong, with precise verbs and evocative imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the story's somber, watchful mood. The prose falters slightly due to a tendency toward overwriting, with a high density of compound adjectives and figurative language ("storm-kissed wonder," "stormlit observatory") that occasionally clusters and feels stacked, particularly in the final paragraph, slightly dulling the impact through excess.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious but burdened by noticeable text artifacts. There is significant conceptual looping, particularly with the words "destination" (used five times) and "questions," which dulls their impact. This repetition, combined with some overwrought phrasing, creates momentum drag in an otherwise tense scene.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is of a very high caliber, with dense, evocative prose and a strong command of rhythm. Sentences like "The moon cleared the jagged skyline, spilling liquid silver over the rusted library's skeletal shelves" establish mood and setting with powerful economy. The prose borders on being overwritten due to the high density of figurative language, but it remains a controlled and effective stylistic choice that does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates high information density in nearly every line. However, the exact phrase “strategically creative” is used twice in a short piece, which feels like a minor but noticeable echo that slightly disrupts the otherwise seamless craft. While the figurative language is consistently strong, its sheer density verges on becoming overwrought, though it ultimately serves the story’s heightened reality.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong, specific imagery. However, it occasionally tips into being overwritten, with dense clusters of adjectives and descriptors that slightly weigh down the momentum, particularly in the opening. Sentences like "its obsidian surface swirling with trapped starlight" are beautiful but contribute to a density that can feel more declarative than immersive at times.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density and strong rhythm ("The tiny wound weeping sap like a tear"). However, there are minor instances of overwriting that momentarily slow the momentum. The description of the cerulean color, while evocative, becomes a long list of poetic clauses that slightly over-explains the feeling. Similarly, the line "Kai understood: the color wasn’t visual" feels a step too explicit, briefly summarizing the epiphany instead of letting the image do all the work.


== Grader: Grok 4 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, as in the opening's sensory immersion advancing atmosphere; some figurative density in peak realizations, like "slow unspooling" of decay, risks overwriting but pays off in thematic resonance without muddle. Minor scaffold in repetitive "slow" descriptors, but high information density and clarity at closure keep it strong.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose has lyrical density with vivid images like "stars pricked the velvet sky," but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeating "steadily adaptive" and "drifting resonance" across sentences) and template cadence in reflective blocks dull momentum without payoff; information advances atmosphere, yet overwriting in peak beats like the ambush recall obscures propulsion, triggering artifact penalties without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid images like "star-salted sky," but paraphrase loops in closing paragraphs (repeating silence-as-canvas) and template cadence in heat descriptions dull momentum; information density is high yet overwritten in peak beats like the resonator alignment.

Information advances story without redundancy; final line recharges motifs effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose advances atmosphere through concise, multi-job sentences like "steam hissed where meltwater met fire," but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeated thawing metaphors, dull momentum without payoff. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specific nouns, though figurative density in peak beats like the crack risks muddle. No major artifacts touch closure, but template cadence in narrations triggers minor deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the opening's vivid metaphors advancing atmosphere; clarity holds despite some paraphrase loops in reflection blocks, such as repeated betrayal articulations dulled by synonym churn ("shattered illusion" to "betrayal wasn’t careless"). Figurative language muddles slightly in peak beats, like mixed river grip and vise of fear, but doesn't obscure closure; information density is high, with sentences multitasking without major artifacts touching the end. Strong verbs and specific nouns dominate, though one template cadence run in the final paragraph ("She would rebuild... The cast would heal...") triggers minor deduction without harming propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the wind's scream contrasting marbled hush, advancing atmosphere without loops; figurative language like "wax pooling like frozen tears" is controlled and payoff-driven in peak beats. Minor scaffold in repetitive silence descriptions exists but doesn't obscure closure; clarity and propulsion hold strong, with no artifacts dulling the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose has rhythmic variation but suffers from paraphrase loops, such as repeated "remarkably composed" and synonym churn around amalgamation, dulling momentum in the convergence beat. Information density is inconsistent, with overwriting in metaphors like "droplets freezing mid-fall like liquid constellations" creating figurative muddle without payoff. Clarity holds, but template cadence in loop recaps (e.g., "In loop three... In loop nine...") triggers a -0.6 deduction, and artifacts touch the closure by obscuring the final realization's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel momentum, as in the opening's humming ventilation to the resonant close, free of loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm in dappled light descriptions, high information in marble polishing beat; minor scaffold in repeated "knew" phrasing, but no loops obscure closure; figurative language coherent, like cracks as silver veins, heightening the final image without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose maintains clarity and concision with high density, varying rhythm to propel the accumulative build, but repetitive phrasing like "hush of beating wings at rest" creates paraphrase loops in adjacent lines, dulling momentum without pattern payoff. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, avoiding muddle, though a template cadence in setup sentences (e.g., "her... her...") triggers a minor artifact deduction. The final line resolves with a charged image, but scaffold redundancies in early descriptions lightly obscure propulsion before the clean closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and revelation, like "the water damage creating images—stains bloomed into phantom violins," though one paraphrase loop in describing stains as deliberate language slightly drags momentum. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety supporting beats, and metaphors cohere without muddle, as in "pages splayed like broken wings." Final line resolves by recharging water-stained ink motif, but minor overwriting in "liminal world suspended between ruin and revelation" trends toward purple in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and concise sentences advancing atmosphere, though occasional stacked metaphors in peak beats like the smudge moment risk overwriting per checks (−0.3).

No closure artifacts—prose propulsion intact during triangulation ("Square three: starlings spiraled...").

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; high density ("temporal splinters, sharp and disorienting"). Minor scaffold in "driftwood nostalgia clung... she remembered" slightly dulls immediacy. Peak beats avoid figurative muddle; final line recharges motif with "distant morning finally, truly, began."

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong propulsion until climax where "nebula blazed directly overhead" introduces purple prose ("cool, calming light seeming to pool"). Template cadence in ghost description ("translucent form... shimmering... holding") triggers -0.4 artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero loops with high density, but "pane of hush" repetition in climax creates mild figurative muddle ("pressing against his eardrums like ice"). Final image remains sharp despite this hairline slip in peak-beat clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero closure-touching artifacts, but "offhandedly exact" repeats without progression and "frost would come/seal" creates subtle paraphrase loop. Propulsion remains strong yet prevents 9+ band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion, but "grief had tightened like cross-linked polymers" slightly over-extends the metaphor into the next clause, creating minor density strain in a high-pressure beat without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "cloud-sea’s muffled roar resonated differently" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Closure beat ("beam that shot through...") avoids figurative muddle while recharging "bottled moonlight" with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "salty and cold as glacier melt" creates subtle metaphor clash; adjacent synonym loops ("rough memories"/"jagged as broken pottery") minorly dull momentum in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "rust flaking like dried tears" avoids cliché with purposeful specificity. Sentence rhythm accelerates during climax ("deep, resonant note... low, harmonic chord") without muddling cause/effect. Strategic telling compresses transit (weeks documenting elevator). Minor deduction for "basso profundo" slightly exceeding plausible lexicon, but justified by librarian expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Paraphrase loops in final third: "quaking reverie" repeated identically 4x; filter-verb stacks ("he felt," "he saw") dull immediacy in peak beats. Text Artifact Screen triggers -0.7 deduction disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "clandestinely luminous" repetition serves motif development. Sentences vary rhythm for pressure ("Rocks began to float upward" vs flowing climax descriptions).

    Zero loops; high density ("dewdrops fall like metronome ticks" charges rhythm and tone); only hairline slip: "symphonically minded" slightly abstract but redeemed by immediate concrete action (tracing cracks).

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops; "correlate" repeats with escalating meaning. "Indifferent stars" avoids cliché through "sharp and cold" specificity. Minor deduction for "beauty in the difficulty" abstraction momentarily dulling closure's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density and propulsion prevail, but "silence so thick it pressed against her eardrums like velvet" risks mixed metaphor, and thematic labels ("silence of fleeting courage") verge on scaffold without sufficient embodied cost in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.7)
    Near-flawless density: "barnacles to a leviathan" establishes setting/metaphor/tone in 7 words. One minor artifact ("tide's thought" slightly ornate) prevents 10.0 but never dulls closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences multiply purpose (e.g., "gripped the yoke... eyes fixed" establishes focus and inversion). Final line’s cadence shift crystallizes theme without muddle. Minor deduction for "profound, internal hum" abstracting emotion where concrete embodiment was expected during peak discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "dove sideways, anemometer clattering" exemplifies high-density propulsion; metaphors like "wind like a blade" remain physically coherent within the container physics framework.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.3)
    Filter-verb stacks in closure beat (≥3 lines) trigger -0.5 penalty and disallow 9+ globally.

Final line "luminous fracture of hope" crystallizes theme without muddle. One near-duplicate ("rusted library") prevents 9.6.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold in climax; propulsion via tactile verbs ("fingers flew," "shuddered") but slight paraphrase loop in reel description mid-beat prevents 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; "crushed moonpetals" reappears meaningfully; "fray like rotten rope" minor metaphor clash doesn’t obscure closure’s crystalline final line.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "cerulean regret" crystallizes tone with high density. "Liquid sapphire" beam risks overwriting but pays off in the coral's "impossible color," though "diffusing a pale blue light through holes" slightly muddles the compass/shawl interaction in a high-pressure beat.
