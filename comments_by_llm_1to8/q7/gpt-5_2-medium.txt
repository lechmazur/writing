    Sentence rhythm varies and many lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the frost drew lacework maps" anchors method and stakes). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Deductions: "drifting resonance" appears three times without clear reweighting (−0.3 paraphrase loop). "Steadily adaptive" is stated twice in near-identical phrasing (opening and close), risking scaffold (−0.2). "Scorched testament" recurs but evolves in context, so no penalty there. The final paragraph's "clear testament that cannot be erased" slightly over-explains the glass metaphor already embodied (−0.2 for clarity redundancy). No grammar errors or major filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean and propulsive with high information density. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Sentence rhythm modulates well ("When his boat flipped, the sea took his hearing and then the world took everyone's"). Minor overwriting: "unshaken marvels" appears three times, and "silently expressive" twice within proximity, edging toward decorative recurrence. The closure beat ("the empty slot...had been a question, not a loss") leans slightly abstract when a concrete image would sharpen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift from declarative ("I am Marek") to participial ("carrying the lens") to subordinate ("When I hold the broken lens"). Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "diving suit patched with burial linen" conveys profession, resourcefulness, and setting constraint in one image). Clarity remains strong through surreal content: "step between two volumes and let my body occupy the gap" is legible despite impossible geometry. Minor loop: "chased stillness" recurs four times, always with slight variation, but the final reprise ("stops running, sitting beside me") reweights it sufficiently to avoid pure redundancy. One figurative muddle: "stone arches lean like drowned ribs" mixes architectural and anatomical metaphors without clear vehicle logic, though it does not obscure cause/effect. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Grammar and tense are consistent; pronoun references clear. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance character, setting, or pressure (bell's dual function, midnight pipeline, elder-runner pairing, decoy carts). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Three deductions: "she was gently persistent" is a label adjacent to showing; "the magic was fear turning into care" edges toward thematic summary rather than pure image; and the phrase "remembered songs" at the end of the elder-pairing beat is generic rather than sensorially specific. The loop check is clean—no paraphrase cycles or template cadence—and the final image (ringing in daylight, declaring together) is propulsive. Grammar and pronoun references are clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language dominates most sentences ("camera obscura artist," "body dies and mouth stays shut," "corridor of her own ribs," "breath to anyone she chose to see"), creating lyric density but risking overwriting. Two mixed metaphors: "chest like an unopened letter" and "embers... feeding restless" blur vehicle logic. Template cadence appears in the middle third (repeated "and" openers, "she + verb" stems). No paraphrase loops at closure, but the cumulative figurative load in peak beats (pilgrim's teaching, sternum release) triggers the density penalty: −0.5 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.3)
    Syntax varies and propels: "She told me she had designed the first maze, seeking the same texture of time, and the bridge had answered by trapping her retrocognitively inside the image of her attempt" compresses backstory efficiently without scaffold. Information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs (e.g., "halo fragment threw a ringed shadow…inside it the fading photographs brightened, then began to move" = object, discovery, motion). Minor filter-verb cluster in paragraph two ("I traced," "felt," "heard") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or template cadence across the piece. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural rhythm variation and strong paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentences breathe with scene pressure. Information density is strong (arrow threaded, chain wrapped, bench wedged). Two friction points: "the kind of person who waits in a doorway until the right footsteps pass" is scaffolding that could be cut; "her motivation is simple enough to carry in one palm" borders on abstract. The phrase "staggering grace" recurs three times without on-page reweighting between uses. No loops or synonym churn; figurative language is dense but mostly clear.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (each line advances setting, device logic, or emotional arc). Opening anchors voice and stakes; final image recharges forge and apple motifs. Minor loop: "memory...was not only what remained, but what pressed on the present until it changed shape" and later "the impact of memories...they could either rot you or forge you" restate the same concept with metaphor variation. Some figurative density in mid-beats ("thudded in her chest hard enough to bruise," "yellow sheen") crowds without always clarifying, and one paraphrase near the end ("Trust might still break...yet she could design for it") restates rather than advances.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries a consistent lyric texture but suffers from figurative density without payoff: "dipped in green fire," "bottled sea," "stamps from another life," "hinge where fate could swing" cluster without recharging at closure. Template cadence runs appear: "he wanted, more than any portrait, to press your ear…"; "not to blackmail their owners, but to reveal…"; "not from fear of losing his craft, but from the strange mercy…" (three parallel "not X, but Y" structures). Paraphrase loops include "luminous disbelief" appearing twice without intensification and "thin threads of choice" echoing "hinge where fate could swing." The moonbeam jar's mechanics ("hummed faintly," "flared, casting moonbeam script") are vague and shift convenience without constraint. Information density is uneven: the flower-code exposition (white lily, violet aster, three ferns) halts momentum mid-beat. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: template cadence (−0.4), figurative density in peak beats without coherent vehicle (−0.3), paraphrase loop (−0.2), totaling baseline −0.9; the artifacts touch the closure beat ("luminous disbelief" reappears in the final line), escalating to −1.2 and triggering the 9+ disallow and high-band cap at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and thematic layering. Figurative language is controlled: "ribs around an empty heart," "ice inside her chest," "pale lanterns" all serve pressure without overwriting. Minor scaffold appears in "Back then" transition and "On the night she chose to abandon" which slightly flattens momentum. The opening and closing images charge effectively. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph structure modulates with scene needs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The piece passes the read-aloud ear test with natural rhythm variation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, action, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully (long opening sentence, shorter beats at cipher resolution). Minor loop: "adaptive training" appears three times without functional variation. Template cadence in adjacent sentences: "I fled…I was searching…I matched…" stems cluster mid-story. The final paragraph risks overwriting: "trembling and certain," "products," "turned on him," "authored" stack conceptual weight without concrete anchoring action. Figurative language is controlled ("moths skated," "iron shelves bled") but "erasers" as metaphor for Vaughn's agents feels slightly abstract. No paraphrase loops; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting: "walls sweating salt and thunder," "ambered hush," "marbled hush," and "pale reefs beneath a tide of inkless water" cluster in adjacent lines without clear propulsion. Some constructions loop conceptually—"distances between terrors" and "routes in the dark" restate navigation by absence. The final beat is clean and propulsive, but mid-story scaffold ("the ambered hush she guarded, a kind of stillness that sealed sound like resin seals a dead insect") slows momentum. No major causality breaks, so deductions stay in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance both philosophical question and loop mechanics without padding. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives during action beats ("It lifted the violin carefully; cold ran through its grippers") contrast with longer reflective sentences that mirror J-17's patient observation. Two minor artifacts cost points: "the kind of machine that aligned broom bristles by touch and never rattled" flirts with telling-via-summary in the opener, and "the mystics on campus said… while the engineers said…" runs symmetric without enough POV coloring. The courtyard reset sequence is kinetic and clear; no spatial confusion, no paraphrase loops. Figurative language ("cold ran through its grippers… something like longing") remains embodied and does not overwhelm pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("crushed crystal," "a window with no curtains"). Persistent template cadence weakens momentum: "she told herself... yet she had begun," "she could have... but her own secret weight," "when Eli arrived... she watched him... saw him... slip it" recur across multiple beats, flattening propulsion. Paraphrase loop: "she did it because mistrust had frozen the building... the missing lens... was blamed on sabotage, a rumor that turned every silence into an accusation" restates "mistrust" and "suspicion" across adjacent clauses without new pressure. Stock metaphor: "thaw begin where it always could" and "freed by what was plainly shared" lean generic at closure. Apply −0.8 for cadence and loop artifacts; no closure-beat obscurity but momentum drags mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clarity and momentum are strong; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. However, several beats repeat content: "the marbles were not charms, not anymore, but reminders" closely echoes "collection of marbles, cracked...now his private ledger." The phrase "because in a measurable world" and "because the meter detected" recur as template stems. Mixed metaphor: a spiral "blooming pattern that also looked like a dying vine curling back" conflates two vehicles. Density is generally high, but these loops and the stacked filter verbs in the final third ("told Mera," "asked," "said") dull immediacy at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines advance character, pressure, or atmosphere. The opening's "hush of beating wings at rest" and "lung holding its breath" establish texture without stalling momentum. However, the middle beat contains mild filter-verb stacks ("watched," "felt," "heard") and the phrase "subdued awakening without opening eyes" borders on oxymoron without sufficient grounding. No paraphrase loops, and the final line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports the wandering, discovery-driven movement. Clarity is generally strong, though the opening sentence's metaphor ("river into its ribs") and later figurative density ("false applause," "as if water damage were developing photographs") occasionally layer without advancing pressure. Minor template cadence in the middle third ("She followed… she felt… she did not draw… she tapped") and paraphrase loops (program unfolded/dampened/opened again across three beats) flatten momentum. Information density is high in the ledger-reveal beat; the final paragraph compresses the musicians' arrival efficiently but summarizes rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm is controlled and purposeful; figurative density is high but mostly coherent (aurora as sorrow-light, guilt as measurement, truth as swallowed weight). Two localized issues: "swaying and unmoored" in paragraph one is near-redundant with "swaying certainties" motif, creating slight synonym churn. The phrase "the night swung on" (hinge metaphor) competes with pressure-system and weight metaphors without clear integration. Information density is strong; most lines advance character or atmosphere. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Propulsion dips briefly in the mid-section summary of Mara's backstory method.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the tunnel and pausing at the punch-clock confrontation. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Two friction points: "the room went so quiet I could hear my own eyelids click" is vivid but borders on stock hyperbole, and "the truth hit with physical heft" abstracts a pivotal beat that warrants more concrete embodiment. Figurative language (beads "caught my headlamp," tunnel "breathed") remains coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking (moss stitching shelves, dust passing through light, fear breaking down like leaves to mulch), but metaphor vehicles occasionally clash or overreach (regenerative silence as "compost," air "repairing torn edges of memories"). Paraphrase loops appear: "witness change without judgment" echoes across multiple beats without added pressure. Template cadence and synonym churn ("drift of untold seasons" recurs verbatim) dull momentum. The closure beat is spared these artifacts, but their spread through earlier paragraphs triggers penalties here.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("moon began to nibble the sun," "love keeps changing and still stays"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "ordinary magic" is stated three times, "cautious exuberance" twice, and the locket's meaning is explained in both the climax and the denouement. Template stems recur ("she believed," "she asked," "she felt"), and the phrase "softly adaptive" is repeated identically. The final paragraph summarizes rather than trusts the closure image, reducing propulsion. Deductions total approximately −1.3 for loops and scaffold touching the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is largely clean with high information density and purposeful rhythm. Figurative language ("bronze dust," "sealed mouth," "ember scales," "extinguished lanterns") is coherent and voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Sentence openings vary and paragraphs breathe with the accumulative design. Minor stiffness: "the charred lines began to align with the dragons' threads, each entry a coordinate" reads slightly mechanical, and "the only repair left to her kind" leans toward Tell, though it remains efficient. Overall propulsion is strong with no artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot—and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "she was the shop's cryptic fortune cookie writer, paid by the line, yet her fortunes had started coming true" immediately followed by "The manager called it marketing magic, but the people who ordered extra dumplings...knew it was an open secret" restates the prophetic premise without adding pressure. Template cadence runs emerge in the middle third: "the light swept the water, the ferries followed the beam, the supply boats followed the ferries, and messages followed the supply boats" uses mechanical parallelism without voice motivation. The final paragraph compresses strongly ("opened the lighthouse pantry and burned every old fortune strip") but earlier bloat ("She was the shop's cryptic fortune cookie writer, paid by the line") could tighten. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence in Q7; given spread into mid-section, disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is dense and rhythmically controlled, with strong images (basalt bolted to air, cloth over bell, ash blue as promise). However, template cadence appears in repeated "not X but Y" constructions ("not with knives or exorcist fire but through rhetorical devices," "not as melody but as metonymy," "not an enemy but a neighbor"). The final third recaps the exorcism's method in a near-summary register ("showing what we assume about power, about maps, about ourselves") that deflates momentum. Figurative language is frequent and mostly effective, though "the unknown was not an enemy but a neighbor with undisclosed names" tips toward precious phrasing. Minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "the possessing thing" / "the parasite" / "the possessing voice") recur without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the accumulative pressure. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes. Minor scaffold: "the kind that only existed as tremors under ice" and "and I folded it into the shell like a note into an instrument" approach paraphrase of prior metaphors but stop short of full loops. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Figurative density is elevated but remains coherent and voice-motivated throughout, consistent with the lyric mode the piece teaches early.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm and imagery are strong: "boots ringing on wet glass tiles," "darkening brightness," "pages closing." Information density is high. However, the piece carries paraphrase loops—"fractured timelines that ran side by side" restates prior branching descriptions, and "the labyrinth of self" recurs with synonym churn ("private maze of fears," "self maze"). Template cadence in the middle third ("In one strand... in another... in a third") is purposeful parallelism but borders on mechanical. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: "every movement seemed to repeat without sound, and even Mara felt the vibrations thin under her boots, like breath held too long." Figurative language (filament, cobweb, startled mice, gray pollen) is consistent and legible, though "wrapped in wool" and "mirrored hush" risk mild repetition of the muffling concept. No paraphrase loops or template stems. Sentence openings vary; paragraph rhythm supports accumulation. Minor filter-verb density in the middle third ("felt its jagged tip," "felt vibrations skitter") is voice-appropriate for a tactile POV. The phrase "conductor with her hands, shaping the backward melody into something the body could understand" works hard but remains clear. Final image ("twilight gathered, carrying with her a new lesson") risks slight overwriting but closes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance setting, choice, or pressure. The opening and closing images are strong. One significant friction: runs of template cadence in the middle ("I found Mara in a locked loft... her wrists rubbed raw, and she whispered that...") and a paraphrase loop around "layered tranquility" (courtyard hush, warehouse "tranquility that tried to pass as safety"). These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats, triggering −0.6 in this category. No loops touch the final image, so closure remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor stakes and resonance. Information density is generally high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or thematic texture. However, several template-cadence runs appear: "I wanted neither punctuality nor forgetfulness; I wanted to discover…" and "some returned to say goodbye, some to forgive, and some to leave well enough alone" use parallel stems that feel mechanical. Paraphrase loop in mid-story: "the texture of time itself, the grain under the fingertip" restates the quest without added pressure. A few filter-verb stacks ("I thought that by uncovering layers I might coax time to confess") dull immediacy in a key beat. Stock metaphor "wind chimes" for the beings' laughter. These artifacts don't obscure closure but accumulate to −0.8 in Q7. No major clarity issues; causal sequence is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high: "boats glide in without creak, gulls open beaks without cry" compresses multiple sensory losses in one line. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("wet cloth," "whale's skeleton," "like twine around her wrist"). Minor slip: "shipwrecks...lodged in a circle as if they tried to flee together and sank holding hands" edges toward preciousness but stays legible. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Opening anchors voice and stakes; closing line ("magnificence...can be simple and still unfinished") recharges the father's wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances appraisal, character, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully: long, layered sentences during setup compress to shorter beats at the transformation ("his coughs turned to a clear exhale, his eyes filled"). Two craft slips lower the score: (1) Minor paraphrase loop—"amber seams" / "the mine had started" / "dust to amber" recycles the amber-transformation concept across adjacent lines without added pressure. (2) Stock metaphor: "lantern under his ribs" is vivid but leans on a familiar image rather than inventing one specific to this world. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; no opacity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. The phrase "a habit of careful kindness made her initiate the longer route" and "money moved fastest when pushed by story" show purposeful compression. Minor ornamental moments: "the sea had learned to whisper words" and "the night wind flipped pages as if applauding carefully" verge on purple without obscuring causality. One micro-scaffold: "When that letter slipped into another envelope and, by accident, reached Mara again" tells rather than shows the coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or theme. Figurative language is frequent and mostly coherent ("craterlight bled through obsidian like dim stars trapped under skin"), but density risks overwriting in non-peak beats—"luminescent ache filling the arbor" stacks modifier on abstraction. Template cadence appears twice: "They paired… and together they began… At dusk they walked…" and "Ilya stepped forward first… and Oren added… and the council answered…" (−0.4). No paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary. The final image ("everyone followed it to one another, not away") lands cleanly. One continuity slip: the "tag" is described as "ink-black" then "carved," muddling medium.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance world logic, character goal, or thematic pattern. Clarity holds across complex mechanics (time-borrowing, cadence-lock, echo theory). However, several sentences loop or restate: "She wore it because she wanted what her sketches could never pin down: the place where echoes are born" closely echoes the prior motif without new pressure; "The metronome tick Orren had started still seemed to follow her, but it kept slipping" restates the interrupted-cadence idea already established. Template stems appear in the middle third: "She touched…then another…Down in…When she whispered…" No figurative muddle in peak beats, but the accumulation of near-synonyms ("layered and luminous," "clear, child-sized figure made of reverberation") slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and high information density (most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot). Figurative language is purposeful but dense: "hearts that felt like scattered seeds," "laugh close enough to bruise," "buried optimism like a lantern under her coat." In the peak beat (seam opening, Orren's outline), metaphoric layering ("a curve, a probability," "a fold of the cavern where time did not settle") risks slight opacity under pressure. No loops or scaffolding; grammar and pronoun references are clean. One small filter-verb cluster ("saw," "heard," "understood") in the seam sequence slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is mostly maintained, but several patterns recur: "He had lived… and he moved," "He wanted… and he had learned," "the instant his fingers touched it, he tasted… and heard," "By the time… yet the city lights still flickered." Paraphrase loops appear: "become visible to those who need you" vs. "visibility… was earned not by being seen, but by being felt" restates the same idea. Filter-verb stacks ("watched through a vent grille, holding his breath") and stock metaphors ("sense memory was his truest lantern") slightly dull immediacy. Information density is high; each beat advances knowledge or atmosphere. No major scaffold or artifacting in the closure beat, keeping the final image clean.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high (most lines advance character and atmosphere), and figurative language is controlled ("bark taking rain," "thoughts branched"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor deductions: "the careful boundaries she kept between observer and subject began to soften, reluctantly, like bark taking rain" is a touch overwritten for a high-pressure beat, and "by releasing control" + "letting the strongest stems choose" is near-synonym pairing within two lines. Closure beats are clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and the read-aloud ear test passes. Minor artifact: the phrase "haggard awe" appears three times, and while it functions as a motif, the repetition edges toward template cadence in the final line. Another slip: "the tone of someone who has seen miracles and broken pipes in the same hour" is figuratively dense but slightly muddles the vehicle. Clarity remains strong overall, and no paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences are present. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Overwriting is limited to one or two beats and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is dense and lyric with strong imagery ("cave pearl sat on a pedestal of calcite, dull as milk"), but the piece suffers from repetitive stems ("Lan said," "Sera lifted," "the force") and occasional figurative muddle ("bright darkness" recurs without clear sensory grounding). Paraphrase loops appear: "overlapping shadows" is repeated across three beats without added detail, and "steadily unpredictable" appears twice in different contexts (Lan's gift, the force's truth) without differentiation. The final paragraph compresses the resolution with summary ("the force inside Lan softened") rather than dramatizing the exit, dulling the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance multiple jobs (the valve is greened, stamped, found in a net; Sorrel's notebook has pages torn at regular gaps). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes. Two line-level issues prevent higher scoring: the phrase "navigated absences, the art of charting what was missing so the living could steer around it" contains a mild paraphrase loop (absences/missing), and the summary compression of key beats (the three evenings, Sorrel's three visits) substitutes synopsis for scene where dramatization would sharpen pressure. No loops or scaffold mar the closure image. The final sentence ("while Mara wrote, to compile fragments into meaning, the sound and the silences both") delivers clear propulsion and thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in action beats (kneeling at the seam, descending the stairwell, punching the ticket). However, patterned overwriting pervades: "trembling certainty" appears twice, "analytically artistic habit" is label-only, and several lines loop concept without added pressure ("the arrows all converged" / "where the pavement-arrows would have pointed"). Mixed metaphor: maps "shining like faults in a crystal" clashes with "gallery of truths she had dodged." Template cadence in the final third (stacked clauses with "she did not know... but... and she began") slightly dulls propulsion. Artifacts do not obscure closure but prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; the long opening establishes voice, later beats compress under pressure. Information density is high—each line advances character or concept. Two frictions: the phrase "she was a sympathetic skeptic, the sort who would hold your grief like a lantern while insisting the dark was real" front-loads metaphor in a way that risks overwriting, and the clause "mixing with your own until you could not tell which ache belonged where" near closure edges toward abstraction. No loops or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences layer action, perception, and world-logic. Rhythm varies purposefully; the final paragraph compresses to match Ilias's dissolution. Zero paraphrase loops. Figurative language ("sky pulsed like a bruise," "immortality peeling away like a coat in rain") is coherent and image-specific. Minor artifact: "each one looking away at a different goodbye" in the reflection passage risks slight abstraction, and "hushed thunder" borders on oxymoronic poetics but reads intentional. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Clarity and propulsion hold through the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines serve character, plot, or atmosphere. Minor line-level issues: "swore its ink liquefies rigid thinking" reads as attributive exposition rather than dramatized discovery; "feeling life keep working even here" at the close is abstract where a concrete image would sharpen. The paraphrase loop "Mara knew... Mara instead..." in adjacent paragraphs creates slight redundancy. No major scaffolding or template cadence, but figurative density in some beats ("air tasted," "gurgle like a throat") occasionally clusters without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character method or sensory accumulation. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph rhythm modulates with scene needs (short early beats, longer garden exploration). However, minor scaffold persists: "by charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn" appears verbatim twice (paragraphs 8 and 17), and "history/histories" cycles across adjacent lines in the final third without added pressure (−0.3 paraphrase-loop penalty). The repetition of "hum" as anchor is purposeful, but the exact template phrase reads as seam artifact. No figurative muddle, filter stacks, or register drift in peak beats. Propulsion is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and sonic cadence. Information density is high: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or thematic layering. Minor loop: "the labyrinth protect what was left" / "the layers inside me held" are near-synonyms in adjacent final beats, though the second adds embodied closure. One filter-verb cluster mid-piece ("I felt the absence," "I learned to keep," "I recognized") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality. Figurative language (memory solvent, barnacles, fabric syllables) is coherent and voice-motivated. No scaffold or template cadence. The final image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is atmospheric and rhythmically varied, with strong momentum through the artifact-discovery beats. However, several lines loop conceptually: "retell what you heard" and "He spoke…but gave it a kinder ending" and "retold…to hear the honest gaps" restate the same premise without added pressure. Minor template cadence in the middle third ("He remembered…He remembered…") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("gloomy cheerfulness was his habit, the way sailors sing") introduce mild drag.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly purposeful ("engines like teeth," "stone heart cracking into many boats"). Information density is high in the middle third (graffiti code, quartz seams, tie-points). However, the opening suffers from scaffold: "She was orderly intuitive, able to sense where a crowd would knot" is tell-heavy exposition, and "Dual allegiance kept her walking a tightrope above the music" is a stock metaphor. The phrase "hope rise and panic chase it" uses a template-adjacent construction. Paraphrase loop: "orderly intuitive" is restated as "the only language both sides ignored" without added pressure. Apply −0.8 for pervasive minor artifacts (scaffold stems, stock images) that dull momentum in the first third but do not touch the closure mural image.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do double work (the hourglass anchors Eli's character and the theme of outlasting time; the iodine clock both structures the beats and embodies Mara's trust in reactions). Rhythm varies purposefully: the long opening sentence sprawls to establish voice, then tightens as dawn approaches. Clarity is maintained despite compression. Minor slip: "the dawning hush, that thin quiet when the birds hesitate and even machines seem to listen" edges toward stock lyricism and could be tighter. One paraphrase near the end: "the sky as it surrendered" and "the last dark with him" restate the same closure image without added pressure, though the second anchors the grain's function. No loops or scaffold elsewhere. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. The final line ("proof that she had seen the last dark with him") lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (the fountain doubles as diagnostic tool, the prism warms his knuckles, the solder "sizzles" counted by sound). No loops or scaffold. Two craft slips prevent higher scoring: "He asked the courier to open the depot doors, so mist and harbor light could slip inside. At his request, the courier poured clear water into the slate channel" repeats the request-fulfillment pattern redundantly across adjacent beats. Additionally, "Though blind since childhood, he oversaw every bench by listening to tools and to people" front-loads exposition that could be dramatized first; the telling is efficient but slightly dulls the opening's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high. Minor template cadence in early beats ("I am Riven Hale…sent north, to a rusted outpost…to correct a blank space") and one paraphrase loop ("the only table not eaten through by rust, waiting for someone to answer the question it held" echoes earlier phrasebook description) lower slightly. The closure beat is clean, propulsive, and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no obvious template runs. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character method, or town response. Minor loop: "infinitely patient" appears twice as a descriptor without added nuance. "As if hearing a confession" and "as if the tower were waking" rely on stock simile stems. The phrase "ghost town revival turned into home" summarizes rather than images the transformation. Overwriting check: figurative language is dense but controlled; "frozen river," "drowned wood," "contented resonance" are vivid without contradicting each other. No clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines are strong. Information density is high: most lines advance setting, character, or stakes. "Each exhale made silver beads that wandered up into the vaulted dark like unanswered prayers" is vivid and propulsive. Minor loop: "gathered hush" recurs five times, three in adjacent beats without fresh charge until the mirror scene. Template cadence: "she overrode instinct" appears twice in near-identical phrasing. Stock metaphor: "like distant bells" is serviceable but not fresh. Figurative density is controlled; no muddle. Proofreading clean. −0.7 cumulative for loop and template stem, but closure beats remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, with longer accumulative passages contrasting shorter declarative beats ("I did not touch them"). Information density is high—most lines advance story, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. The opening and closing images bookend with purpose. Minor deductions for occasional template cadence in the middle section ("I followed...using...and I entered") and a few near-paraphrases ("the hush finally took the words and held them still" echoes earlier "hush" descriptions without adding pressure). The figurative language is mostly controlled, though "folded like paper inside the Fresnel lens" strains slightly against physical logic. No significant loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with strong images—"the hem of her dress sliding through fallen leaves without stirring them," "the mortars rang with a second tone, like a bell under water." Information density is high, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, several overwriting artifacts cluster in high-pressure beats: "joy and grief braided together," "lovingly venomous," "mournful elation," and the stacked metaphor "ashen-veil ghost bride…ghost forward" within a single passage create figurative density without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence appears in the second-night visit: "She had died…and I had fled…Now, in this night-locked valley, she had tracked…" (parallel past-perfect clauses). These issues do not obscure causality but dull immediacy. Minor: "ephemeral cameo appearance" is used twice, once as phrase and once as echo, and reads as scaffolding rather than organic repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("entrances like open mouths," "waves frozen mid crash"), but density issues accumulate: "hauntingly optimistic" is glossed twice in adjacent lines; "reverence" and "precedent" recur without reweighting; the phrase "after the tide pools empty" bookends without causal change. Template stems appear ("she wondered," "she proposed," "she understood"). The final paragraph stacks exposition rather than propelling through image. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence per the artifact pack, preventing entry to 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high ("digging toward the dead might lead her back to something living"). Sentence openings vary, and figurative language (roots as corridors, drafts as pages) serves pressure without stacking. Two deductions: paraphrase loop in "interruption felt too familiar, like the ship that once turned back when her mother died, so she sat…and admitted…her faith had been depending on arrival"—the causal link is restated across two beats without added pressure (−0.2). Template-cadence stem "When the…" and "At the…" appear in adjacent structural beats, creating mild rhythmic monotony (−0.3). No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and figurative language (golden tiles as envelope skin, drones as old pigeons) supports world-building without muddle. However, several beats stack filter constructions ("I wanted time to do what I always do, to discover meaning"; "when you know the calibration tables, you can hear") and the phrase "futuristic nostalgia" in the final line reads as a thematic label rather than an earned image. Minor paraphrase loops ("margins carried ghost-notes" / "ghost-notes: repeated impressions") and template cadence in the middle third apply −0.6 in this category only.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, multiple sentences begin with conjunctive or sequential stems ("To the sentries…," "But in her stitches…," "When the beacon tones…") creating template cadence. The phrase "echoed silence" recurs three times without functional reweighting, trending toward motif over-reliance. Figurative language is dense in places ("whole chorus of unheard stories trapped inside numbers") but remains legible. One paraphrase loop: "she began unraveling conspiracies" / "watched the conspiracy unravel thread by thread." These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats, triggering −0.6 to −0.8 deduction in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening third ("satchel of unsent letters pressed to her ribs as if paper could steady a heart"), but the piece suffers from multiple paraphrase loops: "the stone healed in moonlight" is stated, then "knitting its jagged edge smooth" restates the same fact without new pressure; "she tore it into strips that she floated on the dark water" is followed by "offering the spirits proof" which summarizes the same beat. Template cadence appears in clusters: "and the spirits' song sharpened… and she reached… and she understood… and writing new letters… and spoke the apology." Filter-verb stacks ("she dared to press," "she felt fierce tenderness flare") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. One root artifact: the apology is summarized ("spoke the apology that had lived only in unsent letters") rather than shown, which flattens the closure line.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs (setting, interiority, stakes). Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer opening sentences contracting during the translation sequence. Minor loop: "shared anxieties" appears three times with slight synonym variation, and the phrase "the same fear" / "the same tremor" recycles concept. The coral/cast metaphor stack in the final paragraph ("maze like ridges," "labyrinth," "story hardened around damage," "graft living polyps onto bleached stone") approaches density overload without full muddle, applying −0.3 for mild pattern artifact in a non-closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance image, character, or theme. Minor loops appear: "She carried it to her next commission, and instead of hiding the process she chose to display the lamp and the fragment beside the finished mural, inviting anyone to join her network and remember" restates the communal turn without adding pressure. Stock metaphor: "bright and practical, like a lamp you can rebuild from scraps" lands as generic closure summary. Filter-verb stack in paragraph two ("She was," "She had come," "She wanted") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality. No artifact touches the closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high (each line advances character, atmosphere, or concept), and rhythm varies purposefully. The nested structure creates intentional recursion, not loop: each awakening reweights prior beats. However, figurative language clusters heavily in the second half ("echo folded," "dolls of attention," "rooms" in the pause) without consistent pattern-teaching, and some phrases verge on opacity ("bewitching the mural" is named but its mechanics remain atmospheric). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Grammar and sequencing are clean, but the density of metaphor in peak beats (the third awakening onward) occasionally blurs propulsion rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings diversify, but several template-cadence runs appear: "He said… He taught… He would ask…" across adjacent beats in the second half. Paraphrase loop: "the Bureau had begun taxing not just thoughts but the act of holding them" restates the opening premise without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "spark of defiance" recurs without evolution. Filter-verb stack in Lio's introduction ("belonged," "wanted," "explained") dulls immediacy. Information density is high and propulsion clear, but these artifacts prevent entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with purposeful cadence: "She did not claim credit; she only kept singing softly until the shell, the blossoms, and the people held the tune." Figurative density is high—"reef-shadow joy," "kelp-dreams," "blooded sea," "galaxy postcard, glossy as fish-scale"—and while most land cleanly, cumulative stacking in non-peak beats (e.g., "off-key wind" + "calcium and tide" + "ink to green thread" within two paragraphs) approaches overwriting without quite crossing into opacity. Minor paraphrase loop: "the shell hummed" / "the shell's walls" echo function across paragraphs. No major scaffold or template cadence; information density is strong. Deduct −0.5 for figurative density that slightly dulls momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere or action. However, figurative language clusters heavily: "glimmered like wet stone," "a kind of foxglove regret blooming," "sweet and poisonous," "cloudbanks rolled like slow surf," and the recurring "deserted marvels" frame. Several adjacent lines in the museum crossing restate the same journey without added pressure (crossing, carrying tools, moving between cases), and the phrase "deserted marvels" appears three times as ornamental anchor rather than evolving pressure. Minor template cadence in the final paragraph ("I would keep my rounds, gently systematic, lighting what I could, mending what broke") reads as rhythmic but leans toward summary. No paraphrase loops obscure causality, and the closure image is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several metaphors blur under scrutiny: "silence...was never neutral; it meant withheld translations, unshared credit, or a curse left unnamed" stacks three abstract equivalents without grounding. "Promises had started to sound like paper in a fire" mixes auditory and visual/tactile domains awkwardly. The phrase "carefully reckless" recurs without fresh context. Minor template cadence: "She had hidden... She had learned... She had tested..." The closure beat is clean, but figurative density in the vault scene ("syllables rose as sound, a chord that made the lamps vibrate") verges on overwriting without clear propulsion, triggering a modest deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances plot (blank note, adhesive slide, chain matching) or deepens character (father's teaching, Rolen's public slyness). Rhythm modulates well from exposition to discovery to confrontation. Two minor line-level issues: "ingenious floodgate machinist" (paragraph 2) front-loads a label without immediate dramatization, and "dappled resolve" (paragraph 18) is a stock phrase. The metaphor "building breathes" recurs but stays coherent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Propulsion is strong through peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and rhythm varies purposefully; sentences like "She was a courier pigeon trainer by trade, but lately she trained herself harder" do double work efficiently. However, several paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences dilute momentum: "Everything else in her life she reinvents personal history with, changing names on ration cards, smoothing dates on letters, making paper trails that led nowhere but forward" restates the same concept three ways without added pressure. The phrase "As-you-know" exposition is avoided, but "the last betrayal" and "before the fires took the theater" are past-summary placeholders that could be cut. Template cadence in the Oren introduction paragraph ("He set...and asked...Merek listened...but Mara saw") stacks clauses without propulsion. No major opacity, but cumulative friction from synonym churn and near-loops merits deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines advance the search or accumulate thematic texture. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose is largely clear. Two clusters of artifact pull the score down: (1) "featherly determined" appears verbatim twice, a stock phrase that reads decorative rather than earned; (2) the phrase "necessary distances" recurs four times across the piece, and while thematically motivated, the repetition edges toward synonym churn without reweighting. The final paragraph risks overwriting ("each gap measured to let the hush heal without breaking") but remains legible. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the repeated stock phrases and elevated diction in conceptual beats create minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with strong openings ("Mira Lorne called herself a landscape astrologer") and a charged final image. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. However, figurative language clusters densely in some beats ("slow thoughts," "shadowseamed," "stitched the darkness," "luminous respite") without always advancing pressure, and a few phrases ("softly ingenious care," "quietly oath") feel slightly overwritten. No loops or scaffold; clarity and propulsion remain strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high ("I work where the tide forgets itself" anchors occupation, setting, and tone in one line). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but coherent and matches the lyric voice ("emotional routes," "gap shaped like a choice"). Minor scaffold phrase: "which meant someone had walked here recently with terror in their throat" slightly over-explains the shard's function, but the lapse is brief and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (the bishop introduction establishes character philosophy, plot device, and thematic anchor simultaneously). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the救援 sequence. Two friction points lower the score: (1) mild template cadence in the opening's exposition—"He played...then vanished...Between acts...he became"—creates a presentational rhythm, and (2) the phrase "sea-yellowed" and "crab nets" deliver atmospheric specificity but the opening paragraph stacks descriptive elements without immediate pressure. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance world logic, interiority, or image. Figurative language (moonstone "like a trapped tide," obsidian grace, constellations as line breaks) remains coherent and purpose-driven. No paraphrase loops. One text-artifact cluster in the middle third: "Mira showed her palm… She realized the ban had not destroyed nostalgia… The keeper offered a bargain… Mira thought of wardens…" cycles through summary-adjacent exposition rather than embodied action, losing momentum briefly. The closure paragraph regains propulsion and the final image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and sensory detail is vivid, but several template-cadence runs appear: "He was…he took…he headed…He had…He had also…he carried…he would throw…he saw…he returned…he set…he spoke…he led…he said…he explained…he traced…he saw." This repetitive "he [verb]" stem across 15+ sentences in the opening half creates a drumbeat that dulls momentum. The phrase "rings of a pond after a stone is thrown" is restated nearly verbatim within two paragraphs, a paraphrase loop. Figurative language ("noctilucent reckonings," "lattice like lead came," "silent arithmetic") is vivid but dense in the first third without always advancing the beat. No major clarity breaks, but the scaffold and loops prevent high-band entry. The final image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats. Two friction points lower the score: "reflecting deeply on the cabin fire and on every shouted command that had not reached her own heart" is overwritten and abstract where concrete embodiment would serve; the final paragraph relies on template phrasing ("understood a new grammar," "carrying the lesson like a lantern") that blunts specificity. No loops or scaffold in the closure beat, and propulsion is clear, but the peak teaching moment leans on elevated diction that distances rather than charges the image.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. The "sea breathe through stone like a slow engine" and "mirrors flashed like calm lightning" offer fresh, apt images. Minor scaffold appears in repeated "she + verb" stems across the middle section (four consecutive sentences beginning "She tied," "She read," "She understood," "She stayed"), creating mild template cadence (−0.4). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is controlled and legible, though "serene upheaval, a quiet shaking in her ribs" leans slightly abstract for a peak emotional beat. Mechanics and tense remain consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and many lines do double duty (e.g., "the corridor answered in overlapping taps" advances plot and establishes sensory signature), but several phrases loop conceptually: "legacy's burden" appears three times, "what walls dream about" twice in close proximity, and "ivy-veiled passage" recurs without evolving function. The fireplace-as-trash-pit beat and the diary fragments are vivid, but "echoes" and "dreams" become near-synonyms by mid-story without sharper differentiation. The final paragraph's "promised the sleeping corridors they would be heard only when someone was ready to listen" is clear but slightly over-articulated for the moment's pressure. No mixed metaphors or grammar slips; proofreading is clean, and the opening anchors voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled in most beats. However, the phrase "perceptively calm" appears identically twice (opening and painter's introduction), a loop that signals template reuse. "Dusky harmony" opens and closes the piece, a purposeful frame, but "dusky" as descriptor for emotional tone and light feels stock. Mixed metaphor: "the city like a wet book" then "dusky harmony" then "prism parapet" stack poetic vehicles without clear tonal unity. Some lines do double duty ("the borrowed heartbeat... asked its consent" merges world rule and emotional charge), but others ("I told her my name, my sister's name, and the hour the bells would announce") summarize rather than dramatize. Sentence openings vary; no major grammar errors. Information density is moderate; the middle beat (finding the painter, hearing the lullaby code) could compress slightly without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor well. Information density is high in the ritual sequence. Pattern-artifact penalty applies: multiple sentences open with similar stems ("Sera had…," "Sera mustered…," "Sera read…," "Sera invited…"), creating mild template cadence across the piece. "Operatively gentle" appears twice as a phrase, risking decorative repetition. "The girl" recurs as a label without added specificity in later mentions. Figurative language ("lantern smoke curl into the violet air," "the terrace tilt") is vivid but clusters in the opening and closing, trending toward slight overwriting at the edges. No causality breaks or pronoun confusion; prose is mostly clean. Non-closure artifacts prevent entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: nearly every sentence advances situation, character, or atmosphere. Opening and closing images are strong. Minor scaffold in the mid-section: "She told the board it was research, but in the privacy of her glove she carried…" and "Secretly sentimental, she had paid smugglers…" are adjacent restatements of the same contradiction, creating a brief paraphrase loop (−0.2). "The egg belonged to the storm-petrel of Kandar, wiped out when her first dam drowned their nesting island" is efficient backstory that primes closure. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high (each line advances character, atmosphere, or plot). Clarity is strong except for one muddy metaphor: "light as calm knives" mixes threat and serenity without resolution. Minor template cadence in the middle third: "The governor approached... Maris took it... she guided him..." uses similar stems across three beats. One paraphrase loop: "her true work was to defy that lullaby, quietly, precisely, and forever" echoes the concept restated in the final line without added pressure. No pronoun drift or scaffold. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high across most beats (the dome's dual function, the stick's theft-memory, the reversed thief arc). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening anchors voice and stakes. However, several artifacts cluster: "seedy bars...in seedy bars" is a clear repetition loop; "the circuit of seedy bars where he performed through subversive puppet shows in seedy bars" is syntactically awkward with redundant mention. The phrase "deliberately began to reverse them, drawing each letter from flourish back to bone" reads as slightly over-written for a high-pressure beat. The closure image (stick passing, shadows projected) is vivid and propulsive, so non-closure artifacts are capped at −0.8 per guidance, but the loops touch a key setup beat (puppet-show introduction), raising the penalty slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; nearly every line advances character, setting, or theme. "Blushing" recurs (sunlight, moth wing, grotto stillness) as a rhythmic motif that charges the final image without mechanical repetition. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor issue: "He called himself an esoteric realist, because…" uses a filter construction that slightly distances; the explicatory "because" clause could be shown through choice. One metaphor ("sparks from a hidden fire") works cleanly. Information density is high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or craft. Sentence openings vary and rhythm breathes with the protagonist's attention. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Two minor slips: "the holes chewed and patched, still smelling of tar and songs" stacks modifiers without tight propulsion, and "snowmelt ardor against my cheeks" is a figurative reach that slightly obscures the sensory moment. The final line's "one carefully illuminated braid at a time" risks overwriting but earns its place by charging the closure image with the rope motif.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Several strong images ("vines have pushed through cracks, knotting around consoles like green fingers refusing surrender"). However, template cadence appears in mid-section beats: "I try to read... I lie down... I wake..." with repetitive first-person stems. Paraphrase loop: "my own memories wobble with it" immediately after "the directive is literally rotting, eaten by damp." The phrase "precisely playful" recurs as a label without evolving texture. Mixed metaphor: "words stuck like grit in my teeth" vs. "letters smear into mold" trades vehicles without coherence. Artifacts touch closure beats ("I do not command or surrender; I transcend"), applying −0.5 and disallowing 9+ globally per the cap.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high (most lines advance character, stakes, or setting). The opening line anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Two paraphrase loops stand out: "He understood then why the devotion was encrypted, why it survived purges and fires between regimes, because it was meant for someone who might never arrive in human history at all" rehearses prior causality without new pressure; and the phrase "schematic representations" recurs three times across the text as a template marker. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he understood") appear but remain voice-motivated. Stock metaphor "the unknown" and the abstract "unnamed presence" dilute specificity in the climax. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 for loops and template cadence, placing the score in mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in key beats (glass walls showing three streets, pin clicking "so softly that only bones could register it"). Template-cadence slips: three consecutive "he [verb]" stems in paragraph 4 ("He convinced," "He did not mention," "He set"). Paraphrase loop: "The healer had called it borrowing, because cellular memory is communal" immediately followed by "the sanctuary had held thousands" restates the same communal-memory idea without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "grace were sliding from one joint to the next" and "teaching release" lean generic. Artifacts touch mid-story beats but not closure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and auditory flow. Information density is high (mirror shards as "mountain range," sextant's "convex mirrors" measure reflections, breathing as metronome). Minor density issue: "erasing boundaries was not a trick...but the only honest way" paraphrases the prior sentence's content. A few stock phrases ("bright animal," "second heart") and elevated diction ("articulate," "reconfiguration") slightly reduce specificity in peak beats. No loops or template cadence detected, and the closure image remains vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and propulsion are mostly clean; information density is high in the repair sequence. Two scaffold patterns deduct: "She came for one thing: the daughter's hair ribbon that the canon's child had dropped… If she could give the ribbon back" loops the ribbon setup across adjacent sentences without advancing pressure, and "small objects carried large lessons… to bridge generational wisdom" paraphrases the same concept. "Accidental wisdom always arrived for her like that, uninvited, from graffiti or gossip, then refused to leave" feels slightly over-written for the beat. No loops touch the closure; apply −0.8 for two distinct issues (paraphrase, slight overwriting) under the non-closure accumulation cap.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.4)
    Opening and orchard sequences show strong figurative density and rhythm ("constellations like fruit," "star-fruit fall upward"). However, the piece exhibits multiple line-level artifacts: paraphrase loops ("she would discover a tag… then later find the measurement"), synonym churn for "realize/understand/suspect," and template cadence in the bathroom and logbook beats. The final third stacks filter verbs and abstract nominalizations ("the knowledge was forbidden not because it was evil, but because it was too clean") that dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("she understood the trap… accepting that…"), triggering cumulative penalties in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is uneven; some beats do double work, others loop conceptually without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong opening and closing images. Sentences often do multiple jobs (e.g., "By researching gaps in the clerk's ledgers, she pointed out blank lines where fees were waived" combines method, discovery, and negotiation tactic). However, template cadence appears in mid-section runs: "Lysa listened... Lysa opened... Lysa gathered... Lysa did not fight; she renegotiated" creates a repetitive subject–verb pattern across six consecutive beats without variation. Stock metaphors ("dust-cloak thinned as if remembering breath") and minor filter stacks ("listened to," "realized," "noticed") dull immediacy in pressure moments. No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks, but density and propulsion sag mid-sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in many lines: "behind cracked glass, portraits shifted…her own face flickered between two halves." However, template cadence appears in multiple paragraph openings: "She came," "She tested," "She opened," "She entered," "She pinned," creating a He-verb syntactic drumbeat across six beats (−0.5). Paraphrase loop: "the garden of forgotten names" appears in the opening ("to find the garden of forgotten names") and again verbatim at "Mara entered the garden of forgotten names" without reweighting (−0.2). Metaphor coherence holds, but "motion as a kind of mercy" and "free only within its fog" lean abstract rather than concrete. Propulsion is generally strong, though the final third summarizes key actions rather than dramatizing them in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies, information density is high, and spatial choreography is clear. However, several template-cadence runs appear ("she did not see…but," "she copied…leaving…and when she stepped back") and a paraphrase loop in the opening ("archives were always changing around what they refused to say" followed by "tales that described missing doors, vanished letters") restates the absence concept without advancing pressure. The phrase "as though ink and fiber shared one alphabet" and "warmly methodical" recur but the repetition serves motif rather than loop. The final paragraph's exposition ("it was not the gears that had been repaired; it was the university's conscience") slightly over-explains the thematic payoff. These artifacts touch proximity to closure but do not obscure causality, so the penalty remains within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, with most lines advancing setting, character insight, or plot. However, several phrases lean into stock lyricism: "bloom of hush, a living field that could hold sound softly the way moss holds rain" stacks figurative language without earned specificity, and "hammered repose" recurs as a thematic label rather than evolving through concrete embodiment. The ice-crack/pressure-reading mechanism is vivid, but the climactic conjuring sequence abstracts into "weaving those echoes into a net" without grounding the gesture in tactical micro-choices. Minimal loops or scaffold, but the figurative density in peak beats (conjuring, pact) reduces propulsion by ~−0.6 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with most sentences advancing situation or image: "sound folded inward," "beam held its shape," "stars traced a narrow corridor." No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor friction: "That whispered sabotage felt like a coincidence begging for meaning, and meaning was all I had left to prove I was not alone" slightly over-explains what the surrounding action already dramatizes, and "objects carried memories like dust" is workmanlike rather than fresh. Rhythm modulates cleanly from reflective opening to deliberate work sequences to charged final exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent: "fog turned to stone," "shadows that steadied the fog, as though remembering together could become a kind of architecture." One mixed vehicle: "memories answered, arranging themselves into a new braid" then "pressed against my ribs like a borrowed book"—braid and book don't cohere. A few template stems appear ("the hush in the air deepened," "I understood then why") but do not loop. The final line recharges "nostalgia" and "compass" effectively. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; clarity is generally high. However, several loops appear: "came up the last switchback" / "He chanted while walking," "not prayers exactly, but little rhythmic recipes" restates the same idea; "Tonight was the hush of a night with no stars, the sky a lid of soot-gray cloud" doubles atmospheric description. Stock phrases ("hope fell heavier than stone," "defied gravity more honestly than sparks that chose to climb") slip into forced lyricism without grounding in Jorin's idiom. Filter-verb stacks ("had learned to filter," "he filtered powder") accumulate in the middle third. The closure paragraph ("No stars appeared, yet the sky no longer felt empty") is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "His eyes had hardened" shows reaction and stakes the pause). Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence openings avoid template cadence. Minor friction: "transition periods, the thin hours when tide turns and animals decide whether to hide or feed" leans expository mid-beat, and the phrase "not with visions, but with a sense of which choices could still bend" edges toward abstraction under pressure. No loops or scaffold; clarity and propulsion remain strong. Figurative language (coral that cuts while it builds, time as syrup) is purposeful and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or pressure ("The monks called it a hushling, a vessel for the gilded hush that grows only where people stop speaking kindly" does three jobs). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the inversion and breathing in the tasting niches. Minor artifact: "sprout upward as if the world had turned into soil" is a mixed metaphor (sprouting from soil vs. falling into it), and "as careful as if naming future rooms" slightly over-explains the father's intent. No loops or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; no obvious loops. Information density is high. Two subtractions: "fluidly logical as the terrace's shifting colored panes" is a strained vehicle (logic ≠ colored panes), and the sentence "Elias spoke softly, not to fill the space but to give it edges" employs a filter-adjacent hedge that slightly flattens a peak teaching moment. The opening and closing images are strong. Paraphrase-loop check passes; no template cadence. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally, and most sentences advance character or atmosphere. A few constructions carry template cadence: "The throne had been empty for a century, ever since the dynasty's ships burned and their succession map vanished. Older records hinted that a stairway of ascension still stood..." chains exposition without scene pressure. "She was wisely adventurous, cautious with facts yet hungry for the edge where history became path" tells rather than shows the trait in action. Figurative language is mostly controlled ("ruby flake warmed," "dawn pressed pale light"), though "kaleidoscopic waterfall sounded like static" mixes visual and auditory metaphors. No paraphrase loops or significant scaffold. Propulsion is steady, with one or two beats (the paint-peeling sequence) that could compress further.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (most sentences advance character, world, or pressure). Figurative language is dense throughout—threshold as seam, shadows restless and hungry, grief as wet ash, breath as thread—and while the metaphors cohere thematically, several beats layer two or three images in quick succession without pause, risking overwriting in a high-pressure window (e.g., "starlight spilled into the chapel like water into a sinking boat" immediately after "chimed like a bell underwater"). Template-cadence check: "She knelt, turned up her sleeves, and placed..."; "She told him how she had learned...how she had made..." shows mild stem repetition but stays legible. No paraphrase loops or pronoun confusion. Sentence openings vary. One minor clarity gap: "To teach suffocating to breathe" as infinitive purpose reads slightly abstract mid-crisis; a concrete anchor (e.g., "To pull air back into him") would sharpen immediacy. Overall strong craft with figurative density approaching but not breaching penalty threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or elevated image—without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring causality in the middle third ("slick triangles of paper that tried to wrap her wrists" is vivid but vague about the actual threat). Paraphrase loops: "tell the truth even when it hurt" closely echoes "stop pretending" two lines later. Template cadence: "she kept… she ran… she used…" across three paragraphs. Line-level clarity suffers in peak beats; the drum's mechanics (how confession becomes diamond) remain gestural. Deductions: density −0.5, loops −0.4, template stems −0.4, totaling roughly −1.3 in Q7, plus minor opacity touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; no significant template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high in the discovery beats (crank → notch → second gramophone → ledger → wax strip → voice). Minor overwriting appears: "eloquently silent" recurs three times, and "golden shadows" bookends risk decorative repetition. A few constructions lean ornate ("the first yawn of evening," "private bridge of intuition") but remain voice-motivated and legible. Clarity and propulsion are strong through the central sequence; the balcony scene summarizes the ministers' reaction rather than dramatizing resistance, a minor momentum dip before the quiet close.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.0)
    Figurative density is high and often muddy: "equations prayed," "laughter made of steam," "counting that also sings," "spring and graves together" stack without clear sensory or conceptual payoff. Template cadence appears in several beats ("With each clasp released, the greenhouse sighed..."; "So he reached...followed...unsnapped"). Paraphrase loop: "murmured allegiance spoken in the exact cadence of his long dead captain" is immediately restated as "It was not a command...but a pledge." The closure paragraph ("he felt shivering bliss settle into calm resolve, and the compass needle steadied") employs stock progression phrasing. Information density is moderate, but scaffold and ornamental metaphor slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: "the pattern was a quiet map of absence" and "a sour smell of smoke and river mud rose as if the war itself had been folded up and shelved" are vivid, specific, and do double duty. Sentence structure varies purposefully, and information density is high throughout. Two minor frictions: "a broken-hearted archivist, newly widowed" front-loads summary in the opening, and "her grief shift from a weight into a lens" and "her own heart, not healed, but moving" are stock metaphors that flatten peak moments. No loops or template cadence; clarity and momentum remain strong. High information density with one figurative slip in a closure beat holds the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high, and most sentences advance story or atmosphere. However, the piece exhibits template cadence in the opening third ("she slipped," "she followed," "she spoke") and synonym churn around "revision" and "erasure." The phrase "auric lagoon under starlight lapped against pilings and turned every ripple into a line of gold code" stacks modifiers and metaphors without clarity. Filter-verb stacks ("felt a click," "swallowed the fear," "watched the starlight braid") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Paraphrase loops appear ("the Ministry was rewriting the night already" / "newest she never existed, which was the Ministry's cleanest trick"). Applying artifact penalties: −0.6 for template cadence and filter stacks, −0.3 for paraphrase loops, totaling −0.9 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines do double work (e.g., "the morning fog wrapped him like a familiar coat" anchors setting and foreshadows his method). Clarity holds across the octagon choreography. Minor loop: "prophecy spoken in code" appears three times with slight variation; consolidation would tighten. One metaphor strain: "nostalgia rose, eerie and sweet, like perfume in an empty room" is vivid but the vehicle (perfume) doesn't quite align with the drip-song tenor. Sentence openings vary. No fatal scaffold, but density in the middle third occasionally softens momentum with adjacent explanatory lines.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high and most lines advance character or atmosphere; sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Three prose artifacts lower the score: (1) minor paraphrase loop in the opening ("listening to pods tick… because the elders said each seed carried a remembered name" restates the premise of seed importance), (2) template-cadence run in the vault sequence ("he went there alone… he set a monument… then prodded the seam"), and (3) thesaurus-adjacent phrasing ("mossy and delighted" recurs without dramatized cost, reading as ornamental label-speak). The final "emerges transformed always into hope" converts a physical detail into abstract summary without a concrete image anchor. No mixed metaphors or spatial confusion; clarity remains high despite the stylistic density.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; information density is generally high. Two minor loops: "accidents repeated" and "coincidence becomes pattern" restate the same idea across paragraphs without added pressure. The waterfall beat ("she had to improvise a way past the spray using the gears as stepping teeth") achieves clarity and propulsion. One template-cadence run: "She said… and she learned… So she took… set… and went" stacks similar stems but not quite enough to trigger the −0.4 threshold. The final sentence compresses the resolution effectively but "the chiming minute had shifted… to the one they chose to watch for" edges toward abstract summary rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Rhythm varies naturally, with longer sentences for reflection and shorter beats for action. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight the coin image effectively. Minor issues: "factually mystical" in paragraph one feels slightly self-conscious, and "the sort of deliberate mending that announces what was shattered" edges toward over-explanation when "kintsugi intentions" already carries that meaning. Filter verbs ("I see the reflected word ORIN") are voice-appropriate but cluster lightly in the quench pit beat. Figurative density ("grief itself were luminous," "shame that feels newly polished") is high but coheres under Mara's craft lens without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density with purposeful compression: "She was a lost soul collector, paid by the river towns to bring back the ones who wandered after death" anchors role and method in one sentence. Rhythm varies naturally—short bursts during the confession exchange, longer syntax during the walk. Zero loops or scaffold. Minor density slip: "integrating into healing" in the final line edges toward abstract label rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose carries high information density and purposeful compression, with vivid images ("needles of violet moss," "inkless hands"). However, the piece suffers from template cadence: nearly every sentence after the opening runs long with nested clauses and appositional phrases, creating a drumbeat rhythm that dulls propulsion during high-stakes beats. Paraphrase loop present: "the forest is the archive, and the archive only opens to bodies…" restates without new pressure. Stock metaphor: "loop the pewter strap around my fingers like a rosary" is serviceable but conventional. Figurative density is high but coherent; no clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, but several passages lean on repetitive stems and elevated diction that slow momentum without adding pressure ("the seam of the hatch," "the seam held steady"). Figurative density is high ("web of catwalks," "mist that still wets your hands," "drowned stone and low stars") and mostly coherent, though "elusively tangible" borders on oxymoron without clear payoff. Sentence openings vary. Information density is generally strong—most lines advance setting, stakes, or character. Paraphrase loops are minimal. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but the accumulation of poetic abstraction in the first half triggers a modest line-level deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively: short ("She did not speak") to long accumulative ("My fingers found a small wooden box…sugared peanuts"). Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or spectral pressure. The text avoids loops and template cadence; each paragraph advances knowledge or stakes. Minor friction: "the quiet arrives like a curtain drop" and "dropped an inch, then settled, like a held breath finally released" lean slightly metaphorical for peak technical beats, and "the city lent me its dead, as lightly as lint" in the opening risks purple prose. Clarity remains strong throughout; spatial choreography (floor → counter → ceiling → cabinet) tracks without error. Paragraph structure varies purposefully, and the final line recharges the opening promise without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening anchors voice and stakes. Information density is high (every line advances world, character, or pressure). Minor loop: "the catalog lights flickered" and "The aisle lights went out, then returned" restate illumination-change without new pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: "He uncorked…," "He followed…," "He carried…," "He slid…" creates a four-beat "He [verb]" run that flattens propulsion during escalation. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "clouds become a sea again, then a field, then a mirror" lands cleanly. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high: "visible time draped the void in thin, colored strata" establishes concept and sensory texture simultaneously. However, several sentences exhibit template cadence and figurative overload. "Len Orest, once a revolutionary who had tried to topple the old Consortium and now lived as a defunct relic of that failed fire, walked the museum quarter with a poet's habit of naming shadows" stacks three descriptive layers before the verb, slowing momentum. The phrase "the civilization both of them had never met" is syntactically awkward. Stock metaphors appear: "striking the mirrors like thrown coins," "like a bow on tarnished brass." Paraphrase loop in the confession exchange: Len's motive is stated, then Yara's counter-motive, then the collaborative solution—each a separate sentence restating what could compress. One clarity issue: "the old mistake would repeat" is vague; which mistake? Apply −0.6 for template stems and figurative density in non-peak beats, −0.3 for paraphrase loop.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and most lines advance character or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary adequately, but template cadence appears in the opening third ("Ivo had been told," "The chip was not his," "In exchange for borrowing it") and again mid-story ("Ivo raised," "Ivo spoke," "Ivo used"), triggering a −0.5 deduction for pattern runs. Metaphors are occasionally mixed: "headache of quiet" strains coherence, and "silhouette made of stopped pendulums" + "cold chimes" blur the physical image. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the artifact cluster in high-pressure beats and the metaphor muddle at the inciting incident prevent entry above 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with high information load per line: "jars that once held solvents" economically conveys Mara's repurposing habit and the factory's chemical past. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated: "crevice breathes cool air like a submerged mouth," "awakenings swing quietly on their hinges." Minor template cadence in the psychometry sequences: "The compass whispers... / The hinge in her hand snaps... / The psychometry reading floods..." follows a predictable stem pattern across three beats, costing momentum. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately, accelerating during the cavern descent and slowing for the lagoon's "resonant hush." One weak passive in "had been planned" could tighten to active voice.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most lines do double duty (e.g., "as if time carries different weights" advances both world logic and Mara's learning). Figurative language ("broken jaw," "turbine-hum reverie," "thread that ties moments") is vivid but clusters heavily in the opening third without pattern-teaching, risking density overload. Two paraphrase loops: "realizes the slide is not a recording but a thread" immediately followed by "hears the present storm…and also hears a calmer gale inside the slide" restates time-layering. "Keeps learning" appears twice as a stem. No closure-beat artifacts; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is dense and imagistic with strong propulsion through the seasonal arc and discovery sequence. Sentence rhythms vary purposefully, and the final image is charged. However, several lines carry overwriting: "she began to reckon that the answer might be braided with whatever her mother had been trying to tell her" is abstractly phrased, and "an umbral tenderness that made her slow her steps and listen" stacks metaphor without concrete grounding. Minor paraphrase loop: "the question turned from curiosity to hunger" and "she began to reckon" restate the same shift. The figurative density (moths, moonlit lilies, scratches on ice, exhaling perfume, palimpsest, layers like memory) is high but remains legible and does not obscure causality. No major scaffold or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies; information density is high; no loops or paraphrase cycles. Two mild overwriting signals: figurative language is dense ("slow, stitched cloud," "obsidian lagoon...a mirror so dark it seemed to drink starlight," "water rose like a hand") without pattern-teaching, and elevated diction ("retrocognitively trapped," "parley," "searing reverie") occasionally drifts above plain archive-work register. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the closure image is vivid. Minor template cadence in the middle (repeated "and" openers) does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and advances story without major loops, though several passages restate concepts: "the bottle was a lesson, a container meant to stay closed so hands learned other skills" immediately follows the demonstration of no cork/no seam, creating a paraphrase effect. Template cadence appears in the opening's list-like decay ("Shops sagged, shrine steps cracked, and the wishing bell...had been taken away") and in the craft sequence ("From salt and ash...from lye and fish oil"). The phrase "working memory" recurs four times across the piece, functioning as a motif but edging toward label-only repetition without varied embodiment of the cognitive process. Figurative language is mostly apt ("quiet as a blown out wick," "nested like bones"), though "compressed recollection" borders on abstract when the bottle's contents are finally explained. Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs, and momentum remains steady through the accumulative build.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify; figurative language (sap through bark, wax curled like ribbon, bruise, velvet disquiet) is coherent and specific. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character memory, and causal stakes. Clarity holds through the phonograph sequence. Minor issues: "The voice recites... then slips into a lullaby" and "he is hearing not words but the shape of grief itself" edge toward summary-tell at a peak beat; showing the lullaby's cadence shift would sharpen immediacy. One near-paraphrase: "the orchard scents and the phonograph's rasp braid together" restates the immersion cue. No major loops, but density could tighten by ~5%.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes. Information density is high in the corridor sequence (velvet/burlap/pollen textures) and the sorting ritual. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the spiral of meltwater drew itself toward his hands, and the starlight above the atrium seemed to rotate without moving" restates the same accumulation of order in adjacent clauses. Template cadence runs stack in the restoration paragraph: "He reopened... restored... wrote... carried... tipped." The phrase "furiously tranquil" recurs three times without variation, and "wild serenity" echoes the same concept. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in the final third, where administrative tasks (schedules, labels) replace dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clean with varied rhythm and high information density. Strong sentences: "the sanctuary around her tense, as if even the clouds were holding their breath," "she realized the rope was not for pulling only but for choosing." Minor artifacts cluster in the middle: "the Office feared lawsuits more than silence" and "not a scream but a warning that made everyone lean in" lean toward tell rather than embodied show. Template cadence appears briefly ("she bolted sensors… she tuned the vane… she checked… she walked… she stared… she rewired") with four "she [verb]" stems across adjacent beats, triggering a −0.4 deduction. The final paragraph is propulsive and image-rich, with no loops. Figurative language ("bell rope hanging like a dark river") is coherent and purposeful. One paraphrase slip: "after the glue dries" appears in both the opening setup and later beats without added detail.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual breathing. Information density is high: most lines advance character, setting, or thematic charge. Minor overwriting: "spiritually curious enough to bow before meteor charts the way others bowed before saints" and "flourishing stillness, the kind that grew when nothing insisted on being loud" carry slight metaphoric density in the opening third without pattern-teaching. A few near-loops: "not because the world was fixed, but because they had found a way to stand within its breaking" echoes prior vulnerability-as-strength phrasing. Clarity remains high; no major scaffolding or template cadence. Figurative language (light needing a vessel, tide of grief) is coherent and grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance setting, character, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally—"Then the fires came, Mara died without a goodbye, and the covenant knotted itself" accelerates, while the final reading sequence breathes. Minor deduction: a few near-adjacent phrasings echo without adding pressure ("kept the bees and kept the stories," "keep the bees and keep the stories" in quick succession; "tended the bees and tend each other" / "tended again"). These loops are brief and do not obscure causality or dull the closure beat, so the penalty remains modest within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies, paragraphs breathe, no hard scaffold loops. Information density is high (silo function, capsule history, tag mechanics layered across beats). Minor overwriting in the exchange beat: "the air went utterly still" and "unable to sense his pulse as a countdown" stack abstract emotion without concrete anchor, applying −0.3. One paraphrase near the opening ("clocks…ornaments / calendars…blank art") restates the same premise across two clauses, applying −0.2 for synonym churn. Figurative language ("green light folded inward like a closing eyelid") is coherent and purposeful. Clarity remains high; no coherence breaks touch closure. Cumulative deduction −0.5 within band.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high with multi-tasking lines (e.g., feather + string interaction advances both theme and object collection). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the kite rescue and breathing in the final drake scene. Two notable artifacts lower the score: the opening 63-word sentence front-loads orientation but tangles syntax with "after the last shower, the cobalt lagoon after rain," creating echo within the clause. Template stems recur in the middle ("he listened," "he asked," "he showed") across the net and kite sequences, flattening momentum during key teaching beats. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors, and the final lines achieve clarity with "imperfect and shining in the burnished hush" reprising the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high—most lines do double work (e.g., "veined with lichen and warm to the touch" gives texture and foreshadows the final image). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops appear. Minor template cadence in the gathering sequence: "a monk promised... a fisherman promised... a child promised" uses parallel stems without variation. The phrase "as if she were daring her own cells to quit" borders on overwriting for this POV's established register, though it doesn't obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift ("At the tower gate," "On the plaza," "When the pilgrims," "I realized"). Information density is high: most lines advance discovery, character stance, or atmosphere. Figurative language ("cooled bronze," "like tiny ladders," "deep" flash) remains controlled and coherent. Minor template cadence in the middle third ("I followed," "I scraped," "I held," "I realized," "I took") clusters first-person stems but does not obscure causality or dull the closure beat. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; clarity and propulsion are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances ritual, stakes, or thematic resonance. Syntax varies purposefully—short commands ("I answer aloud"), long accumulative spirals ("from the water rises a chill, not a ghost with a face, but a pressure of memory")—creating natural rhythm without template cadence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful: "narrow as a spine," "rattling like small bones," "throat of a sleeping beast." One minor clarity slip: "the submerged concord is still holding somewhere under the dead reef" could be more concrete about what "holding" means physically. The final lines propel cleanly: "Keep it" commands without explanation, trusting the image to land.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance image, motive, or causality. Rhythm varies purposefully (longer syntactic braids in setup, shorter cuts during the cylinder read). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. The figurative language ("split like pottery," "sound turned sideways") is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor: "watching the mirror catch minute shadows as the cylinder turned" and "Letters rose out of those shadows, tinted revelations that looked stained by smoke" compress two slightly redundant descriptions of the same visual mechanism within three lines, creating a micro-loop that slightly dulls momentum before the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the sketch discovery and breathing at the final walk. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and the navigation problem simultaneously. Minor deduction for occasional overwriting: "temporally stretched feeling loosened into ordinary time" could compress, and "a direction earned rather than assigned" slightly telegraphs theme. No loops or major artifacts. The opening and closing lines frame voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings shift, and information density is high: most lines advance setting, character choice, or pressure. "The wrong sky churned, as if someone were repainting it with a wet brush" is vivid without muddle. However, minor loops appear: "chivalrous thief" and "sacredly playful" recur as labels rather than evolving; "cautious abandon" is named twice without dramatic variation. The chess-swap sequence is clear, but the final leap into "the map's first corridor" relies on abstract diction that slightly dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, action, or motif. Opening sentence anchors voice and stakes in one move. Rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Two minor loops: "the method my mother taught for secret markets, a pattern of walking that spells words, each turn and pause forming a letter" slightly restates itself; "I listened to courtiers trade rumors… then marked each speaker not by names but by gestures" could be tighter. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("absence can glow," "nomadic penumbra," "whispering gallery answered") though "loyal to no crown, casting shifting shadows across the mosaics" stacks metaphors without sharp image. No major scaffold or filter-verb stacks. Final line recharges the chessboard and "luminous absence" motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with longer exploratory sentences early ("shelves rose like cliff faces, and every corridor bent back on itself, as if the building listened for footsteps the way a storm listens for trees") and tighter, more urgent beats as pressure mounts ("We walked fast, naming each turn aloud"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or stakes. Figurative language (hidden thunder, scales on sleeping fish, compass needle made of breath) is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor paraphrase appears in adjacent phrases ("not a polished story" / "the raw moment," "nightly shuffle" / "kinder lies"), and a few template stems recur ("the seer…" as sentence opener across multiple beats), but these do not measurably dull the closure image. Clarity and propulsion hold throughout; no major loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies well across the piece; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density is high—most lines advance multiple jobs. Clarity holds throughout spatial and causal sequences. However, figurative language clusters densely in several high-pressure beats: "sky had pinched the hour," "snowflakes hovered like pinned notes," "village's trapped heartbeat," "水releases a stone dropped too long in a fist." The phrase "fidgets productively" recurs exactly twice, borderline scaffold. The opening sentence runs long with multiple nested clauses that slightly slow entry momentum. "Fierce repose" (a required element) appears only as a standalone phrase mid-paragraph without integration into action, reading ornamental in that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("listening metal," "reeds," "bread") is vivid and mostly coherent. However, the piece carries moderate scaffold: "forged hush" and "pale spire in mist" recur as labels without evolving meaning, and the final third summarizes three major beats (lunge, capture, judgment, blinding) in rapid succession, reducing information density. The phrase "dragging the canyon into their shame" elevates diction beyond Mara's established voice. Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines: "passed poems hand to hand like bread" near "the crowd took up the lines," both describing the same crowd action without added detail. No severe loops, but momentum softens in the closure rush.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense; sentences often do double work (e.g., the key ring charm introduction gives object history, emotional anchor, and symbolic weight in one beat). Opening and closing lines are strong. Deductions: occasional figurative density without breathing room ("memory quilt," "seam," "golden repairs flare like small suns" cluster tightly in the final third) and minor template cadence in the dive-match-surface sequence. The "quilts memories together" phrase and "kintsugi intentions" edge toward poetic scaffold. No major loops or clarity breaks, but the piece hovers at the high end of acceptable ornament for peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly purposeful—"fork like veins," "twine around his ribs," "minutes can pretend to last"—but the concentration risks overwriting in high-pressure beats. The cave description is vivid yet the monologue paragraph ("All his life he had painted harbors as if they were departures…") stacks clauses in a way that slows momentum when the scene should crystallize. Minor paraphrase loop: "temporary eternity" is coined, then explained, then reprised without added pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "When Lio finds…he returns…while the hidden oasis keeps…" reads as scaffolded summary rather than propulsive closure. No severe artifacts, but density and rhythm slip under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance ritual, relationship, or thematic layer. Rhythm modulates from the opening's short declaratives to the longer suspended syntax during the vibration sequence. Minor paraphrase loop: "made me hold the cork to my lips as if it were a whistle, then told me to say one sentence I meant" followed immediately by the whisper—efficient, but the "as if it were a whistle" simile adds little. Stock metaphor "like a blue bone under new light" in the opening and "like a hand raised from sleep" for the blink are functional but not fresh. No template cadence or major loops; clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance character, plot, or atmosphere without padding. Sentence rhythm varies effectively between long accumulative clauses ("families streaming to the coast when the inland wells turned brackish, but now the tide has eaten the ports and the people are coming back") and shorter declarative beats ("I stay anyway"). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Minor deduction for two instances of participle-led long sentences that slightly compress causality without obscuring it: "With the hydraulics dead I cannot raise the roof lens…" and "When the migrants reach the station…" both stack multiple clauses that could breathe more. The closure line—"what I have built is not a machine but a promise"—lands cleanly with propulsion intact. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentences tighten under pressure ("I lifted the glass eye and occluded my good eye, focusing on the captain's boots"). Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Two friction points lower the score: "searching through rumored cures in discredited textbooks" repeats "discredited textbooks" within one sentence (paraphrase loop), and "psychological safety" appears four times, creating mild scaffold echo. The closing abstraction "fractured grace" twice in the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than earned image, slightly dulling propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, setting, or mystery. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight prior images effectively. Minor scaffold appears in mid-story phrasal repetition ("Eamon asked," "Eamon told," "Eamon understood") that could tighten, but no loops touch the closure beat. Figurative language ("opal dock," "borrowed memories," "far star") is purposeful and does not muddle. Syntax varies; no template cadence mars peak moments. One paraphrase near midpoint ("worked the problem the way he tended the lens, not forcing it, just noticing") slightly restates an earlier observation, warranting a small deduction within the non-closure cap.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; no scaffold loops. Information density is high (chip glimmers→coordinates→cavern in compressed sequence). Minor figurative density: "like continents," "like lilies," "like paper" cluster without becoming muddy. The phrase "as if listening" (blooms folding) and "unafraid" (ants) trend slightly generic, but clarity and propulsion hold through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; figurative language is purposeful ("lace around a throat," "crown-shaped ring"). Clarity holds through complex actions (rope, descent, cauterization). Minor density issue: "bleeding starlight dripping into her hands" in setup, then "bleeding starlight, Maelin said, and the words tasted like copper" mid-scene is a near-loop that slightly flattens momentum. No filter stacks or template cadence. A few elevated constructions ("velvet dragged over glass," "liquid dawn") compress meaning but verge on purple in peak beats. Proofreading is clean; no loops or scaffold otherwise.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and paragraph structure supports scene pressure. Information density is high in the closure sequence (shell mechanics, sun release, Academy watchers). However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "directed spontaneity, the habit of planning a risk and then taking it as if surprised" restates itself; "mixing equations with longing, scientifically romantic to the core" is redundant within three lines. Stock metaphors cluster in early exposition ("copper smoke," "warm light folded in his coat pockets"). The phrase "the word sell fell like ash" and "emotionally romantic to the core" lean toward generic lyricism. Template cadence appears in the shell-filling sequence ("He poured…Toma steadied…Lio spoke…When the last stripe filled"). Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and stock phrasing; these do not touch closure directly but dull mid-scene propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (scroll, dreams, swap, gratitude, writing all advance). Sentence openings vary. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("nostalgia… hunts it, teeth out," "soar… like a page torn free"). Minor slips: "the kind that does not miss a place but hunts it, teeth out, in the dark" and "the kind who sells other peoples nocturnal revelations to daytime magazines" use appositive-gloss structures twice in the opening, creating a faint pattern of explanatory scaffolding. "I realized my method for escaping panic was getting jealous of past selves, counting their unspent chances like coins" summarizes the insight rather than fully dramatizing discovery, though the prior swap beat does show it in action. These touches slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong sensory anchors ("dripping water clock," "reddish tarnish only on one side"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "reading between lines of polite ink and the shaky spaces where a hand had paused" → "peering at messages through the shop's wet glass, through the loupe" recycles the occlusion method without added pressure. Template-cadence check: several sentences open with participial phrases or "When Iris" constructions, creating mild syntactic monotony. The final paragraph summarizes the realization rather than trusting the dramatized walk and clock-drop image to carry it, adding scaffold where elision would serve. No major artifacts touch closure, so Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: one distinct issue (loops + template stems) = −0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Deductions: "the same scent Ila remembered from the day lightning shattered their roof" is a paraphrase loop (scent already identified as mineral/lightning). "Crystallizes when stressed" appears twice in adjacent concepts (ink formula, ink flashes crystal facets). Template cadence in the opening: "She had come…because…," "In that childhood storm she had hidden…," "Now, years later, she was told…" stacks similar stems across three sentences. Figurative density ("bowl turned upside down," "breath like hot tea," "story told at the right volume") is high but mostly coherent; "glitter softened into a dark line" strains physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled, information-dense, and propulsive. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. The long opening sentence and the final compound sentence both modulate breath purposefully. Minor density issue: the phrase "half columnist, half exorcist" and "shopwork miracles, imperfect by design" border on decorative but are integrated enough to serve character. One paraphrase loop: "imperfect miracle" is used twice in close succession (once as concept label, once as June's answer); the second feels slightly redundant. Overall clarity and momentum are strong, but the figurative load is high in the first third without full payoff until the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, but multiple lines loop conceptually: "spiral arbitration" is explained twice in adjacent passages, and "cosmic illusions" recurs without deepening. Filter verbs ("I felt," "I realized," "I heard") stack in the final third. Figurative language is dense and sometimes mixed: "threads rose like threads" is circular, and "memory refusing to fade" + "rose from sand and shadow" competes for vehicle. Template cadence appears in the mirror sequence ("each mirror I saw," "each term," "at every loop," "at every narrowing"). Apply −0.8 for loops and filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; information density is high (most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes). One minor paraphrase: "the click of a moment being severed" and "marked the time" cover similar conceptual ground in adjacent beats, but the phrasing differs enough to avoid true loop. Template cadence appears briefly in the first paragraph with multiple "he" + verb stems, though the variety of verbs and clause types keeps it from flattening momentum. No stock metaphors or therapy-speak; figurative language ("ice blooming…like white moss," "two blades crossing") is fresh and coherent. The final sentence runs long but remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.3)
    High information density: most lines advance character, stakes, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (mica pane, clover, "tree of forks and odds") is concrete. Minor issues: "made my grief feel both lucky and bruised" and "clover melancholy" restate similar ground without added pressure; "Lucid Contradictions" as exhibit title is on-the-nose; "theoretically rebellious, the kind who argued about ethics in seminars yet obeyed speed limits" is scaffolding that could compress to action. No major loops or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high—nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully: short beats during the woman's call ("She had dialed the wrong number on purpose") accelerate pressure; longer sentences in reflection ("Mara had believed estrangement was a wall, but her wrong-number friendships had shown it was also a bridge") allow breath. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Mild overwriting in two spots: "like a door that will not open twice" strains the metaphor (doors do open twice), and "the haunted melody folded around the words, turning them into something survivable" edges toward purple without quite crossing. Figurative density is high but mostly earns its keep; the glass disc and loop imagery cohere. Grammar and punctuation are clean. Strong propulsion; the piece never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled, information-dense, and propulsive. Sentence variety supports the accumulative design: "Euphoria surged through her like warm wine, and then the haunt followed it" compresses contradictory affect without therapy-speak. Figurative language (reeds hiss like paper, lilies open as if the jetty were flowering inland) is purposeful and sensory. Two frictions: the clause "because she had written the official record that named Jun an accident" slightly over-explains what the next sentence will dramatize; and the phrase "proximate causes" recurs four times across the story, twice within two paragraphs, edging toward template cadence. No major loops or scaffold, but the repetition of "proximate causes" as both method and mantra could tighten. Overall clarity and momentum remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Opening and closing images are strong. However, mid-passage phrasing shows template cadence: "In flood seasons she moved… in drought she traded… in every crisis she kept" stacks three parallel clauses without variation. The phrase "crooked channels" appears twice in close proximity (paragraph 1 and mid-text), a minor loop. No paraphrase cycles touch the closure beat, so non-closure accumulation cap applies. Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed vehicle: the moon rock as both "catalyst" and "cure" blurs its function slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence stacks figurative language ("quiet blaze of heated needles," "grief was a continent," "messages like glass," "melody-in-progress," "grammar of heartbeats," "snow," "quiet blaze" reprised). In the climactic pool scene, clarity holds, but mid-journey beats blur under metaphor density without pattern-taught payoff. Paraphrase loop: "dowse for the stillpoint" / "dowsing again" / "she dowsed" repeats without added pressure. Template cadence: "she touched," "she let," "she followed," "she traveled," "she found" creates a repetitive stem pattern across the journey. Some filter-verb stacks ("felt it as," "understood it was") dull immediacy. Information density is high, but momentum occasionally stalls under ornament. No single artifact touches the closure beat directly, so the 9+ disqualifier does not apply, but cumulative line debt is significant.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or conflict. The phrase "the contradiction was the point" and "drafts could be made kinder without erasing the pain" approach thematic summary but remain anchored in Mara's work. Minor paraphrase loop: "the signals were not warnings but invitations to thresh meaning from experience" closely echoes prior thematic material without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the final paragraph: "she understood that comfort could be strange and still true, a warmth that comes from admitting..." stacks abstract claims (−0.3). No loops or scaffolding touch the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance image, character knowledge, or symbolic charge. The piece deploys extended single-sentence paragraphs and comma-spliced constructions for lyric accumulation without teaching the pattern explicitly, which slows momentum in mid-passage. Minor paraphrase loop: "taught me sign language years ago" is immediately followed by a second clause restating the same backstory beat. Figurative density is high (lanterns as commas, "cavern of sudden quiet," "stitching brief recognitions") but metaphors remain coherent and voice-motivated, not template artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line-level craft is competent with selective sensory detail and varied syntax. Information density is high; most sentences advance situation or atmosphere. However, declarative summary recurs in emotional beats ("the thought cracked her throat with shame," "tenderness surged like magma") where embodied action would sharpen pressure. Figurative language is frequent and occasionally mixed ("love felt like a volcano turned outward"). Template stems appear in the trail sequence ("Then came the third sign," "Behind the canvas a narrow drawer"). No loops or major clarity issues. Proofreading is clean. The final line's metaphor ("light the way home for everyone still reading in the dark") is evocative but slightly over-explained by context.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, but several patterns recur: repeated participial openers ("using taps and hums to steer," "leaving us shaking"), stacked modifiers in peak beats ("cold fire spread…the lagoon answered, brightening in rings"), and paraphrase loops ("the drug would let memories be stored like harmonics" / "our memories were now tied"). The metaphor density in the trance sequence (chords, constellation, auroral curtain) occasionally muddles rather than clarifies. Clarity holds at closure, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 for template cadence and figurative excess in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance situation or character. Rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the challenge and rescue beats. Minor loop: "whispers travel farther than shouts" is stated twice in nearly identical phrasing (once as Mara's argument, once as enacted proof). The phrase "the storm was not done" is a stock transition. A few elevated constructions ("aurora writhed," "taut thread") elevate diction slightly above the established working-voice in peak moments but remain legible. No major scaffold or paraphrase loops; action sequence is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "bruised coin," "ribs were a staircase," "silt" on tongue, "star-net." However, some vehicles stretch plausibility: ribs as staircase winding *down to the water* is anatomically muddled, and "spiralingly calm" risks overwriting. Information density is strong; no loops or scaffolding. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the mirror descent. The final image lands cleanly without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several patterns recur: "Eli heard the unspoken..." appears three times in similar constructions, creating a template cadence. "Cradled" (magnets, tin) repeats twice in identical syntax. Mixed metaphor: mist that "swallow[s] sound and return[s] it as an amplified quiet" contradicts itself (swallowing precludes return). Figurative language clusters in the opening and grotto beats without always clarifying ("mist outside into watery stars," "hush where past meets prophecy"). No paraphrase loops, and sequence clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: most lines do double duty (e.g., "Nobody could blame a knife, because no blade could draw blood anymore, only shame" establishes Accord rules and tonal irony). Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives at high pressure, longer cadences in reflective beats. Two minor loops: "guarded heart/guarded hearts" recurs without added pressure, and "detach" appears four times with slight synonym variation. The final image—"stepped into the sublittoral green and let the sea claim my truest shape"—propels without scaffold, though "truest shape" edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: the long opening sentence establishes weight, shorter beats at the goat scene accelerate. "His confession landed without drama, like a stone into snow" is vivid and apt. However, mild scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "For the first time in months a short sound escaped me that might have been laughter" followed immediately by "Orin bowed as if the spill were the climax of a tragedy that ended in forgiveness"—the second restates the first beat's emotional resolution without advancing pressure. The phrase "remade hush" recurs five times but with purposeful reweighting, so no loop penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is image-rich and rhythmically controlled, with strong figurative language ("air holds a lantern-moth hush," "letters on the quartz loosen, sliding like frost melting"). However, density occasionally tips into overwriting: metaphors stack without always advancing causality ("cloth has become weather," "shadow made of shadowed cloud"). A paraphrase-loop appears: "repeating his sentence but changing a single noun" is immediately followed by the demonstration, which could be tighter. Minor template cadence in exposition ("She was raised on," "She circles the colonnade, reading"). No major artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping penalties modest.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; each sentence advances negotiation or world detail. Rhythm varies (short tactical beats, longer lyric passages). However, paraphrase loops appear: "the phoenix's return changed more than the skyline; it left behind bartered awakenings" is immediately glossed in the next sentence. Template cadence in the middle third: "Joren pauses, tempted… / Joren finally speaks aloud… / Joren walks the spiral…" stacks "Joren [verb]" openings across four consecutive beats. The final image—reed tongue vibrating, chimes trembling, "every tremor shows her a new shade of wrong"—is vivid, but "shade of wrong that feels strangely right" is a told epiphany rather than shown sensation. Minor filter-verb stack ("eyes shine with the shock") dulls one peak beat. Applying Template-cadence check (−0.5) and Paraphrase-loop (−0.2) in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high: most sentences advance character, setting, or theme without padding. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language (prism bell breaking silence into colors, lens as small sun, sounds with weight and temperature) is vivid and coherent, though "golden shadows" recurs as a motif without always doing new work. Slight scaffold: "We began feeding the lens fragments…" and "We redesigned the loop…" compress significant design work into summary transitions rather than scene beats, but this serves momentum at this length. Grammar and punctuation are clean; no pronoun ambiguity. The phrase "the more we questioned assumptions, the more the artificial pilgrimage shifted" uses a parallel construction that borders on template cadence but remains functional. No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "She was a mourning jewelry maker, and every pendant she had ever soldered now felt like a small coffin, each clasp a promise she had failed to keep" front-loads metaphor before spatial anchor. "Subdued ardor, the steady heat of a forge kept low" stacks near-synonyms. Figurative density in most sentences of the opening and Lysa's arrival beats (curtains "woven to respond," "folds were set with purpose," "bend starlight into an answer, or into a wound") without crisp payoff. Paraphrase loop: "teach…that even at the end of oneself there remained a direction" recaps prior "paper birds that would guide the desperate" without added pressure. Template cadence: "From a box…shaped…set it…used the stencil…stepped between…whispered…pulled…aligning" chains actions in identical stems. Clarity survives but momentum drags. No pronoun confusion; tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and key images (tape, skylight, ink-dark thumb) recur with purpose. However, several lines loop conceptually: "multiplying paths" appears three times without evolving meaning; "steadily curious" bookends but doesn't shift. The single-sentence paragraph structure, while intentional, creates visual monotony across 800 words. Minor clarity slip: "slid one card toward the spot where my tape marked twelve feet"—spatial choreography (is the tape already laid out?) is momentarily unclear. No major figurative muddle, but the density of elevated constructions ("a patient reverse engineering of why a city repeats its songs") occasionally slows momentum in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("bronze prism pagoda," "light corridors thickened," "flower of metal"). Clarity holds in most beats. Yet paraphrase loops appear: "my curiosity was steadily unpredictable" / "the sort that either finds truth or burns a library down" restates risk without added detail. Template cadence: "I knew from fragments... But the instructions were missing, and my teachers had warned..." stacks clausal stems. Filter verbs ("I understood," "I felt," "I saw") cluster in the climax, dulling immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure third, preventing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high across the piece ("garden turned inside out," "sunlight thinned to amber," "hope torn into ribbons") without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure, triggering the overwriting density penalty (−0.5). Some phrases loop conceptually: "softly deliberate" appears twice in identical construction (lines 3 and 12), and "the shadow unbound" recurs as a label without evolving. Sentence openings vary and syntax is controlled, but information density suffers when metaphor stacks (e.g., "luminous regret for what the light could not keep" conveys mood more than plot). No grammar errors; momentum is steady but not propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character or situation. Rhythm varies (short action beats, longer reflective passages). Two small issues: "she let the shame rinse away without excusing it" is slightly abstract at a pivotal moment, and the phrase "fragile conviction she had clung to: that saving animals meant you could trust the people" uses a colon where internal punctuation would be smoother. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The final paragraph's sequence (drove animals, signed forms, returned, pinned tail tip) propels cleanly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory specificity is strong ("brown rings on the saucer," "roots that pulse like veins," "dust orbit slowly"). However, figurative density in high-pressure beats occasionally muddles: "trauma always settles in circles" and "the ivy shows her a memory of something bright being dragged underground" rely on abstraction. Minor loops: "the sight makes her swallow hard with satisfaction and dread" / "the neighborhood has been growing sicker, and Mara's own wound refuses to close" rephrase causality without advancing it. The closure image ("raised script she can finally read without tearing it wider") is clean and propulsive, mitigating line-level debt.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the booth made her feel like a burglar of light, stealing frames from dust" establishes voice, setting, and metaphor). Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual texture. Minor figurative density in the opening third ("crystal gazer," "burglar of light," "shame itself") risks overwriting but coheres under the lyric lens. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One template risk: "she saw," "she imagined," "she understood" recur but stay within psychometry frame. Propulsion is strong through the vision and projection beats; the final paragraph breathes appropriately after peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance image or action. Rhythm varies, though certain stems ("Sel could hear," "Sel believed," "Sel heard") repeat across adjacent paragraphs, creating template cadence that dulls propulsion. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but stock metaphors ("bruise of green fire," "moths") and elevated diction ("shadowed rapture," "murmured names") cluster in peak beats without fresh payoff. Clarity is maintained; no causality breaks. Filter-verb stacks ("Sel could hear," "Sel heard") appear in high-pressure moments, reducing immediacy. Figurative language is dense but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Overall, solid line-level craft with noticeable artifacts that prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"dawn trapped under skin," "bloom dune itself," "coal alive in a tin"—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff at closure, approaching −0.5 for overwriting. Runs of "I [verb]" and "the [noun] [verb]" create template cadence: "I did not sleep… I had learned… I tried… I walked… I understood… I let… I offered…" across six beats triggers −0.5. Paraphrase loop: "everything occasionally everywhere" / "archive made everything occasionally everywhere" is restated without pressure gain (−0.2). Cumulative artifact penalty −1.2 in Q7. Propulsion is steady but density occasionally obscures causality; the final third remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high (most sentences advance atmosphere, insight-mechanism, or translocation pattern), and figurative language is mostly coherent (wind through trees = instruction types, gear = confirmation token). However, paraphrase loops appear: "I woke elsewhere" / "Each morning I found myself" / "I woke once on a bridge" / "Another morning I found myself" recycles the same stem across four beats without meaningful variation, triggering a −0.4 template-cadence penalty. Additionally, "probable miracle" appears twice in identical phrasing (opening and close), which reads as anchoring rather than churn but adds minor redundancy. Line-level clarity remains strong, but the loops and repeated construct ("I woke/found") dull propulsion in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies across beats (short breaths during the chase, longer braided sentences during the vigil) and sensory detail is textured ("heather and cloud braid together," "scree," "bracken"). However, multiple sentences open with similar stems ("The guides…," "Mara…") creating template cadence in the middle third, and synonym loops appear: "gently persistent" is stated then echoed with "gently persistent even in silence" two paragraphs later without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("fog rolling," "eyes hold maps that do not look like maps") and one mixed vehicle ("star on the punch flashes once, like a small promise"—stars flash, promises don't) blur specificity. The vigil section compresses transit efficiently, and the final line lands with clean propulsion. No severe opacity, but the piece would gain density by trimming paraphrase and tightening figurative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances discovery, choice, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary, rhythm modulates with pressure. The discovery sequence (thumbprint → hidden door → bin of hardware → surveillance chamber) is propulsive and clear. Strong specific images: "bolt glinting like a tiny star," "hymn that had no voices, only humming pipes," "frost in her breath looked like a small flag of surrender." Two issues prevent higher score: (1) Minor paraphrase loop in the therapy-hall paragraph: "the therapist signed in frustration that no repair request ever reached the maintenance office" followed shortly by exposition about the spiral staircase feels like backfill rather than forward momentum. (2) "Silent choir" metaphor is used three times with slight variations (opening, underground revelation, protagonist's role) without sufficient reweighting each time—reads slightly scaffolded. No major loops or artifacts touch the closure beat, so impact is contained. Proofreading is clean, syntax varies purposefully, and peak moments (the whisper, the director's entrance) are tight.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives during action, longer lyric arcs in atmospheric moments), and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("vines hung like loosened braids," "dust descending in veils"). However, several beats suffer from paraphrase loops: "messages left in library books for eyes patient enough to read margins" restates the cryptic-message premise without new detail, and "the library began a graceful collapse: shelves leaning like courtiers bowing out, ladders folding, dust descending in veils" lists parallel images without causal linkage or embodied urgency. The clause "and he meant to unmask the pretender to the throne who now signed decrees with a stolen name" front-loads exposition that could be dramatized through action. These artifacts appear in non-closure beats, but their accumulation (paraphrase loop, exposition stack, decorative list) triggers a −0.8 deduction and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance character, situation, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, with longer contemplative beats in the opening balanced by shorter tactical sentences during the skiff sequence. The palimpsest image and tapping motif recur with reweighted meaning rather than mere decoration. Clarity remains strong throughout. However, a paraphrase loop appears in the opening: "the loss had made her choose work that measured change instead of mourning it" closely restates the prior "coral bleaching witness" concept without adding new pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the middle: three consecutive sentences beginning with "She [verb]" or noun-then-verb in the chart-assembly passage create slight rhythmic drag (−0.3). The phrase "feeling moored to the station by duty and drifting toward a question" stacks two metaphors that nearly contradict (moored vs. drifting), though the tension reads semi-intentional given the "drifting moored" motif (−0.2). No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and textured with strong imagery ("oily gusts," "seams between stones," "thin carrier wave"), and most sentences advance action or atmosphere. Information density is high in the middle section where opera glasses, hum, and coordinates converge. However, several passages loop or over-elaborate: "the bay held only the thunder outside and the serenity of empty metal" paraphrases the earlier mood without added pressure; "awkwardly confident" is restated in varied phrasing across beats; and metaphoric density occasionally muddles clarity ("the bay breathed in slow, oily gusts" anthropomorphizes without clear POV anchor). Template cadence appears in chains like "She sat… lifted… watched… realized." A few figurative choices strain coherence (thunder as drummer, bay breathing), and the final third's sensory catalog (thunder, skylight, console, stones) risks saturation. No severe artifacts touch closure, but mid-section loops and filter-verb stacks reduce propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance world, character, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully with longer lyric sentences at setup, tighter syntax at the unsealing. Minor loop: "The crystal did not guide her; it commanded her" and later "a life with a future written inside it" restate the implanted-control premise without added pressure—one paraphrase instance, −0.2. Template cadence appears in the opening third: repeated "Nara [past action]" stems across three lines, −0.4. Figurative language (steam as curtains, ground hums like drum, moss remembers) is consistent and voice-motivated. No major clarity breaks. Propulsion is strong through the decode and unsealing; the final two paragraphs summarize months but fit the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the panic beat and windbreak sequence. Two minor artifacts: "bodily signals so she could pause before panic grew teeth" stacks metaphor, and "a sound like tearing metal" borders on stock trauma descriptor. The phrase "her body kept a catalog of danger that words could not file away" shows purposeful compression. No paraphrase loops detected. The final paragraph's list ("to translate, to breathe, and to keep growing") risks slight template cadence but remains voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("the sea below flashed like a cracked mirror," "shelves rose like ribs"), but several metaphors stack without clear payoff: "bleed light into uncertainty" and "dust…mourned [the sun]" edge into overwriting. Sentence openings vary and paragraphs create visual rhythm. Minor loops: "luminescent ache" appears twice, and "the lighthouse turned/turning" recurs without added meaning. The closing line—"asked, without needing answers, who she would paint next"—lands cleanly, but the penultimate paragraph's "accepting fracture" nearly summarizes the theme rather than trusting the image alone. No major artifacts touch closure, so non-closure deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the piece carries notable overwriting in figurative clusters: "the world thickened and seconds stretched," "sky had become syrup," "someone else's fingers on his pulse," "shining black," "corridor of slow-moving dust" all appear within the first half without pattern-teaching or payoff. Mixed metaphor: ink as "shining black" (visual) vs. "pool accepted him without splash, folding him away" (tactile/spatial) strain coherence. Template cadence appears in the opening: "came back," "sat cross-legged," "had trained himself," "kept a bottle"—multiple past-tense anchor verbs in quick succession. Paraphrase loop: "the archivists swore would fade only on command, yet in Keir's hands it vanished whenever truth approached" restates the same paradox without added pressure. These artifacts cluster in the first third, reducing propulsion, but the closure beat is cleaner. Applying −0.8 for multiple distinct line-level issues (density, coherence, template stems) that do not touch closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.0)
    Information density is high and the prose advances character and atmosphere effectively, but several paraphrase loops and adjacent restatements dull momentum: "the letter was bait, I realized, written to be found" echoes the prior insight without added pressure, and "dizzying quiet" recurs as a stock phrase. Template cadence appears in mid-paragraph runs ("I should have… yet the first line… My hands shook because…"). These artifacts do not obscure causality but lower propulsion and trigger the loop penalty. Figurative language is vivid but occasionally stacks without respite in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    The single-sentence paragraph structure creates both visual rhythm and comprehension drag: multiple 150+ word sentences stack clauses with semicolons and commas, forcing re-reads. "She is the bounty hunter's pacifist daughter, raised on campfire tales of captures and gun smoke, yet she practices a quieter craft: inculcating plants with values, whispering patience into seedlings, coaxing mercy into thorns, so their blooms can tutor anyone who enters" exemplifies overwriting—figurative density without clear propulsion. Template cadence appears in the opening's list structures and in "came...meant to drag...did not argue...led...watched" chains. The phrase "senselessly perceptive" is striking but never unpacked. Stock metaphors: "dark snow," "hunger for order," "distant drums." Information density is high but clarity suffers; the piece would gain momentum from breaking the longest sentences and pruning modifiers like "tranquil blaze" that work against each other.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high with purposeful compression ("reeds of glass hummed," "ponds rose in ripples shaped like staff lines"). Rhythm varies naturally and propels through the final beat. Minor template-cadence pattern: "He did not hum; he opened his mouth... The pool answered... and in the sky one constellation stumbled" uses balanced clause structure across three beats. No loops or paraphrase; figurative language (sleepwalking constellations, feral lullaby) remains coherent and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (each beat advances character and plot). Clarity holds throughout. Two line-level debts lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop: "His new planet was an orbit of regret: he kept it spinning so he would not have to face the still center of that death" restates the metaphor without added pressure. (2) Template cadence: several sentences open with "She [verb]" or "He [verb]" in rapid succession mid-story ("She laughed softly...she grew quiet...She traced...She asked...He obliged"). These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy in peak beats. No mixed metaphors or register drift; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are purposefully mixed. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, several phrases loop: "meteor hush" recurs four times, "guilt" five times, and "lost sounds" three times without incremental pressure. The phrase "the laboratory of lost sounds" appears identically twice in close succession (letters mention it, then the door opens onto it), creating paraphrase drag. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt the tether slacken") in the closure beat dulls immediacy slightly. No major artifacts or clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "mist pooled," "whispering grotto," "lilac unease," "emergent hush," "spirals…tightened," "residue lingered," "room inside sound." Many sentences carry metaphoric freight without clear payoff, creating a textural wash that occasionally obscures causality—how exactly does the tile flake "teach the echoes a new trick"? Template cadence appears in the opening: "Mist pooled…turning…making…" stacks participles. Paraphrase loop: "the grotto repeated what you said until it lost its sense" is restated as "echoes…bounce." Information density is moderate; some beats advance atmosphere more than plot. No scaffold loops, but the prose leans purple in high-pressure moments without sharpening clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or stakes. The opening "stones rinsed white by ash and rain" and "chewing was the first quiet truce" demonstrate strong concreteness. Several figurative phrases cluster in non-peak beats without obscuring clarity: "jointed like a cradle," "through ice," "blue as river depth." Minor artifacts: "the boy trembled as Samir buckled the Grasp" tells rather than showing specific tremor; "despair hardened into law" is abstract. "Loosed by heat" and "pried it free" work cleanly. Paraphrase check: "the council had called the survivors...Cinders, a name meant to keep them small" and the immediate follow "Samir believed names were scaffolds" stay distinct. No major loops, but cumulative elevated diction ("dissident's patience," "aberrant mercy," "retrocognitively trapped") applies a mild density load in the opening third that slightly slows momentum before the vision beat.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and sentences vary in length, supporting the accumulative design. Information density is high in the opening third. However, the piece contains multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "brink of despair" appears twice (opening and closing) without reweighting between; "applause" recurs four times in similar syntactic slots; "echoes/echoing" appears three times in adjacent beats without pattern payoff. The phrase "lure possibility from the brink of despair" is repeated verbatim at open and close, reading as thematic bookend rather than charged reprise. These loops dull momentum in the middle third and touch the closure sentence, triggering cumulative penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences multi-task (e.g., the muscovite gift anchors father, tool function, and thematic image in one paragraph). Syntax varies purposefully, and the opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, the prose carries mild overwriting: "fractally precise," "willowglass hope," "tiny repeating forks," and stacked metaphors ("map under his skin," "lattice of light," "nest of melted cables") in quick succession elevate register without clear POV motivation. Paraphrase appears: "hidden pathways" recurs across four beats without functional shift. The penultimate sentence's "willowglass hope, delicate but unbroken" adds figurative density at closure without necessity, slightly dulling propulsion. No major loops, but cumulative decorative weight −0.6 to −0.8 within band.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("mouth that might open," "enormous sleeping body") serves thematic weight without overwriting. Minor issues: "Now the fossil sat warm against her palm, factually mystical" and "The longing did not feel like hers, and that frightened her more than the tide" are clean but edge toward summary-assertion where embodied perception would sharpen. "She set down her lantern, pressed the fossil to her chest, and watched it float" sequences cleanly. No loops or scaffold. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm and clarity are generally strong, but the piece suffers from recurring scaffold patterns: "She was quietly inspired," "To unscramble it, she began," "As the truth unravels, she realized," "When their words came back," "On the seventh night she found"—template openings that stack across beats. Mixed metaphors ("fear that wrapped the warehouse like resin" after "silence lay unearthed") and elevated register ("braid of voices," "unearthed silence") occasionally obscure rather than sharpen. Information density is high, but paraphrase loops (buttons described twice, prophecy mechanism explained in overlapping clauses) reduce propulsion. The final paragraph over-explains the closure instead of trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and most sentences advance. However, several lines carry faint scaffold or paraphrase loops: "betrayal and mending can be neighbors" / "broken things ever return to use" restates the core metaphor with minimal added pressure. "Silver hush" recurs four times, teaching a pattern but risking decorative saturation in middle beats. Figurative language in high-pressure beats (cave, radio tuning) remains concrete and legible, avoiding mixed metaphors. Propulsion is strong overall, with minor template cadence in the backstory paragraph ("She had come back… The Director had offered… Her motive was…").

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.0)
    Density is high; most lines advance image, character, or stakes. Figurative language clusters in the opening ("lamp halos," "spindrift serenity," "scabbed and scraped") without overwriting peak beats. Minor loop: "closely attentive" and "ambient awareness" recur as labels rather than varied embodiment. The final sentence runs long with stacked clauses ("keep driving, closely attentive, until dawn rinsed...") that slightly dull propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: "the thrum steadied, answering his touch like a creature phototropic to kindness" does triple work (lantern behavior, character trait, thematic seed). Minor figurative density in the opening third ("chimney smoke flattens against a low sky...pressed-gray lid") borders on overwriting but remains legible and voice-motivated. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence; propulsion is strong through the closure beat. One small register note: "phototropic" is precise but slightly technical for the established idiom; it works because it's a concept-element, not a casual diction choice.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines advance action or charge imagery. Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm breathes with the turns. The rosebush/mirror/gauge motifs recur with evolving meaning, no loops detected. Minor figurative muddle: "thin green ladder" and "bones in moonlight" cluster without clear causal work, and "quivering hush" repeats as texture rather than constraint. Some filter verbs ("feeling every step," "understands her garden") dull immediacy in mid-beats. The closure beat is clean, limiting penalty reach.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance image, choice, or world logic. Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines charge the frame. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language ("brittle awakenings," "cloud forests") is consistent and clear. Minor penalty: the phrase "atomically reflective, as if each groove held its own mirror" leans slightly explanatory in a peak beat, and two adjacent lines in the stone-circle sequence use "I realized" then "I understood" in close succession, creating mild template cadence. Overall propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines carry image, action, or interiority. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the read-aloud ear test passes in peak beats. Minor deductions: "I set up a small desk… and waited. People came in a prismatic quiet" compresses efficiently, but two adjacent phrases ("tugging gently through my wrist" / "tugging through") echo without added pressure. One brief run of parallel "for X to Y" constructions (widower, girl, soldier) feels template-like but does not obscure causality. No loops touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high; nearly every clause advances plot or atmosphere. However, the piece suffers from moderate overwriting: figurative language appears in most sentences of the climax ("grit under her nails," "something vast had leaned closer," "spectrum analyzer blossomed," "pressure change") without pattern-teaching, creating tonal saturation. The opening sentence runs to 46 words with nested clauses, slowing initial propulsion. Minor template cadence: "the manager… the physics chair… the Quiet… the Votaries" list structure recurs. No loops or scaffold, but density occasionally tips into ornament. Deduction: −0.6 for figurative saturation in peak beats, −0.2 for opening sentence drag.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout, especially in crisis beats ("corridors declared spatial mutiny," "cathedral turned inside out," "clenched like ribs"), risking ornament over propulsion. Several lines paraphrase the same spatial-rebellion concept without adding pressure. Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports the exploratory tone. No outright loops or scaffolding artifacts, but the accumulation of metaphor in peak moments (wall hinging, lock spinning) slightly obscures immediate causality. Information density is strong when grounded in organ-pulse mechanics and compass strikes; softer when abstract ("space gave way with a grudging sigh").

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.6)
    Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances investigation or character—but three artifacts dull momentum. Template cadence: "I accept because...and because I suspect" followed by "Sato says...and the judge wants" stacks parallel clauses across adjacent lines. The climax compresses Maren's confession into summary ("she confesses that during the Masque she lured the dancers...panic did the rest") rather than dramatizing the pivot beat. A paraphrase loop: "by unifying opposites, we can unite guilt" repeats the core metaphor within two lines without added pressure. The opening anchor and caliper imagery are vivid, but the final third loses propulsion to exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong imagery ("the ground were spitting it back after a century of holding its breath"). However, the piece suffers from overwriting in several high-pressure beats: "the metal made a small ringing sound as if it recognized the room" stacks metaphor; "the whole building exhale as the lock yielded and a drawer of vellum maps and letters slid forward under its own weight" mixes literal and figurative action awkwardly. Some filter verbs and synonym churn appear ("asked to see them," "watched her," "held her hands steady"). Sentence stems vary adequately, but a few scaffolding phrases ("she told herself," "when she touched it") dull immediacy. No loops or major clarity breaks, but density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high ("wet-plate collodion glass flake into my palm, cold as creek ice"). Clarity holds across most beats. However, several sentences loop conceptually: "pixelated portrait" and "broken into pixels" restate without adding pressure; "luminous disbelief" appears three times with identical phrasing (baseline −0.2 paraphrase-loop, −0.3 for stock metaphor repetition in peak beat). The final paragraph stacks elevated diction ("kindly pixelation," "legal future loosening") that drifts slightly from the established register under peak stress. No scaffold or template cadence, but the figurative density in the pullout sequence approaches overwriting without pattern-teaching. Cumulative artifacts: −0.6 in Q7; caps remain below 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high: most sentences layer character history, world detail, and thematic motif (e.g., "After he vanished into a prison transport that overturned in fog, I inherited his stash"). Rhythm varies purposefully with longer reflective passages and shorter action beats. Minor loop: "territorial markers" appears in adjacent paragraphs (train perimeter, rival encounter) with near-identical descriptive function, creating redundancy. Template cadence in the middle third: several paragraphs open with time/transition anchors ("When a rival crew," "Across LoopLine's rise," "When the startup began") that flatten propulsion. No figurative muddle or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; no major loops or scaffold. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. However, a few stock metaphors appear: "ship stalled in black water," "quiet weight settling into the ribs," "pain from the living and store it in ritual." The phrase "midnight solace that lets pain be spoken" reads slightly generic. The dream sequence employs purposeful compression ("each pulse struck the carvings, turning them from silent grooves into a sequence of lit syllables"), and the final image is concrete. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the elevated register occasionally drifts toward abstraction without POV-specific grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance image, conflict, or world logic. Rhythm varies appropriately, and the opening/closing lines anchor voice and closure. However, several paraphrase loops and template stems appear: "the curse on Lake Kestrel tightened" → "the curse's machinery"; "lost things drifted toward my steps" → "the lake was stealing them"; "mirrors were innocent tools" → "the real enemy was the wish to be seen without being known." The phrase "widening rings" recurs decoratively (twice in narration, once in the ending) without evolving pressure. Minor synonym churn ("swirling orchard vortex" → "spinning orchard" → "orchard branches circling") and a few abstract phrases ("warlike serenity," "the dark water behind it, honest at last") reduce immediacy in peak beats. No artifact touches the closure sentence itself, so caps do not apply, but cumulative drag lowers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.9)
    Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Sentence rhythm varies, and figurative language ("roots sunk deep," "linking through scars") serves world-building without overwhelming. Information density is high in the first two-thirds. However, several artifacts cluster in the final third: "the overlapping dreams began to tear at one another like dogs" uses a simile that feels generic under peak pressure; "stitching the crack with a living thread of shared pain" stacks metaphors (thread, stitching, shared pain) without clarifying mechanics; "when dusk lifted" is vague sequencing. Two minor loops: "the covenant carried them back to a present that could wait for its future" and earlier "the dead future from owning the living present" recycle the future/present frame without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., "Tree roots snaked between bones, lifting skulls like pale apples" establishes setting and introduces the orchard's eerie biology). Rhythm modulates well between lyric description and scene pressure. Two patterns reduce momentum: minor paraphrase loop in paragraphs 7–8 ("holes in his soul" / "whatever was missing" / "patch, a stitch") and template cadence in the Vey exchange ("Vey traced... then tapped... and the clearing seemed"). "Trammel" used in different senses (line 4 vs. line 24) risks lexical confusion. No filter-verb stacks or major loops in closure beats. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "dark pollen" effectively recharges the organic imagery at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most lines advance multiple dimensions (e.g., "manufacturer marks, corrosion patterns, probable dates" shows both method and emotional defense). Rhythm varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops or template cadence appear. Some minor overwriting in figurative clusters: "ears filled with silence," "facts felt like earplugs," "the valley holding our voices in its stone throat" stack metaphoric vehicles within short spans without full integration. The closure beat itself remains clear. One scaffold phrase: "confidently uncertain nods, the kind I once gave sound engineers" over-explains the gesture. Overall propulsion is strong, with strategic compression of the appraisal work allowing focus on the emotional investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; figurative language is purposeful (script/clay, stylus, parchment dipped in ink). Rhythm varies and paragraph cuts are clean. Two issues cap the score: (a) minor paraphrase loop—"he cannot bear for it to remain only grief; he needs it to become comprehension" restates the same motive within adjacent clauses without added pressure (−0.3); (b) elevated diction ("conjugation into another state," "the two no longer fight for the same room") occasionally drifts from the tactile translator voice toward abstract philosophizing in a high-pressure beat (−0.4). No artifacts touch the closure image itself, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: two distinct issues → −0.7 total.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance world logic, ritual, or stance. Rhythm varies naturally with longer accumulative passages breathing into shorter beats ("They only nodded"). Opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes. However, several template cadences appear: "Some mornings the baker... and by dusk the diver... and the ledger accepts"; "a pressed kelp star, a hymn written on onion skin, and a fisherman's bamboo creel"; the triplet structure recurs in at least three passages, creating mild rhythmic predictability. Additionally, "He asked me to preserve wonder in routine, to make sure the city did not turn its shifting selves into mere paperwork" edges toward thesis articulation rather than trusting the image. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains high. Deduction totals roughly −0.6 for template cadence and one instance of slightly elevated telling in a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, with longer constructions in the opening ("She learned that every bunker carried two inventories: canned beans and battery stacks, and the unspoken fears that clung to the concrete like damp") giving way to shorter beats during the cave descent. Information density is high; most sentences advance story or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the widower said the pearl awakened via confessions etched inside a seashell's spiral, and that if you traced the lines and spoke them aloud, it would drink what was left unfinished" restates mechanics already implied by prior action. Template cadence in the final third: "the pearl warmed," "the pearl flared," "the pearl's latent radiance spilled" stacks similar constructions. The phrase "abandoned hope" recurs four times without clear evolution. Stock metaphor: "broken into silent rainbows." These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum slightly in the closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high throughout. Minor deductions for a few paraphrase loops ("record birdcalls in time stamps, and crosscheck every detail" followed closely by similar measurement clauses) and one instance of over-patterned lyricism in the final paragraph ("allude in the melody to my brother's laugh, my father's hands, and the pills I chose to leave behind"). The accordion's patched bellows appears in three distinct beats without feeling forced. Clarity and concision are strong; no major loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance discovery or reweight prior material. Rhythm varies without template cadence, and metaphors ("bottled dawn," "time to show its seams") are coherent and voice-motivated. However, paraphrase loops appear: "cautious exuberance" is repeated verbatim in the opening and near the end without transformation; "fateful letter" recurs four times as a stock phrase; "the watch ticked forward, then backward" echoes "reversed every thirteen minutes" without added pressure. The phrase "he understood then that the library did not store other people's secrets; it stored the words people refused to release" is explanatory summary where scene pressure could show the realization. These loops and a tendency toward expository interiority reduce propulsion in mid-beats, though the closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic: "the cloth made every footstep sound like an apology," "sung into shape by wind," "bright as sap." Information density is high; most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. Minor scaffold appears in the opening clause chains ("My job was to trace...which wars...which signatures") and the explanatory aside "because everyone knew researchers read lies in documents" interrupts momentum slightly. The final paragraph's "before the promise loses its glow" recurrence is purposeful. No loops or filter-verb stacks, but the expository backstory about the pollen spill and the invented lineage edges toward summary rather than dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high, and most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "Those shifting specks formed a map toward what she called the threshold of stillness" establishes method, stakes, and voice simultaneously). However, the prose carries noticeable overwriting in the first half: stacked metaphors ("pearl caught in a net of light"), elevated register ("lucidly watchful" repeated as both attribute and description), and paraphrase loops (the static becomes "clear enough to follow" after already being described as forming "a map"). The closure paragraph is cleaner, but the density artifacts in setup beats justify the deduction here.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and figurative language (fermenting foam, scalloped curves, loam-threaded vines) enriches without overwhelming. Sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and auditory variety. Deductions: the single-sentence structure runs long in places, occasionally obscuring the beat's propulsion (the 95-word opening sentence carries multiple embedded clauses that slow entry); and minor filter-verb stacks ("she noticed," "she understood") appear near peak moments without being voice-motivated. The closing beat is clean and propulsive, capping non-closure losses.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is generally clean. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. Minor scaffold appears in phrases like "as if conscience could be packaged like lamp wicks" and "as though the empty glass carried an absence," where the simile/metaphor work is slightly over-explained. One paraphrase loop: "the cloak of doubt did not simply cover shoulders, it covered motives" restates the idea without new pressure. No template cadence or heavy loops; clarity is maintained under pressure. Final image is purposeful and concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is high; many lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "stars spilled in a thin ribbon" anchors locale, tone, and the grotto's visual signature). Opening and closing lines charge each other well. Two line-level issues lower the score: a paraphrase loop occurs in the grotto sequence ("he had first entered here as an old man and walked out a boy" / "The grotto did not reverse time... it reversed attention" restates the same conceptual ground), and elevated diction occasionally drifts from the narrator's established register ("forwards aging researcher... backwards aging researcher" reads more like dossier-speak than lived perception). The figurative density (sycamore hush, floating platform, ripple geometry) remains coherent and does not muddle peak beats, but the metaphor load is high throughout without a taught pattern to justify saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "weathered resolve he sifted them" conveys both time and character). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity is strong in the ritual sequence. Two craft notes lower the score slightly: elevated figurative density in nearly every sentence ("bleached organs of old giants," "wings wrote a moving script," "echoes stitched a path") creates a steady lyricism that, while legible, trends toward overwriting in a high-pressure beat where plainer syntax might propel more. Second, "dusted centuries" in the final line is a minor stock phrase. Proofreading is clean; no grammar or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully: "Below, the automaton reached the terrace door and began calculating angles to pry the stone free, but the folly answered with silence" balances clauses for emphasis. Zero paraphrase loops. One cluster of figurative overwriting in the opening third—"silver dark," "halos," "impossibilities," "accommodated impossibilities," "brilliant dimness"—packs four metaphoric constructs within ~150 words without full payoff until the terrace, creating minor density drag. The closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is mostly concrete ("curtains that waved like tired flags," "silt," "split ring"). However, multiple passages exhibit mild overwriting and register drift: "by wandering purposefully toward what the tag seemed to signify" is syntactically opaque, and the phrase "insisting that every sound has a color and every color can be kept if you bind it to truth" reads expository rather than enacted. A paraphrase loop appears in the vow passage: "promising to hear without wanting, to see without grasping, to let sound paint me and then pass" restates the same commitment three ways without adding pressure. The closure beat ("not as proof for anyone else, but as a covenant to keep walking my pier") remains clear, so deductions are capped at −0.4 under the non-closure adjustment, but density and propulsion slip in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; figurative density ("bruise lit from within," "footprints that form behind a walker," "sacrament made of chemistry and fear") stays controlled and advances image or stakes without muddle. Information density is high: most sentences multi-task (e.g., "Tonight the receiver spits short static bursts..." anchors time, action, and problem). Minor loop: "quiet enthusiasm" recurs three times with near-identical phrasing; "distill/distilled" appears four times across key beats, risking synonym churn. The final paragraph's "edgewise one has begun to roll, slowly, as though time is finally choosing a side" lands cleanly, but the preceding "decides purpose is not a monument but a loop" edges toward thematic summary. Overall propulsion strong; line-level clarity high.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing action, building atmosphere, layering motif). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: light as "thin bridges," syllables "crystallized into tiny salt bright shards." Minor overwriting in the middle third where metaphoric vehicles crowd consecutive sentences without breathing room: "vibrating against the lens," "sound gained edges," "syllables began to crystallize" stack in quick succession. No loops or scaffold present. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. The closure beat is clean and propulsive: "tucked the crystal under the atlas page where the ocean was blank."

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density and varied syntax; the opening anchors setting and stakes efficiently. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated ("nets hang like empty ribs," "a door in a far house"). Minor pattern: "The bell, he believes" and "The steward, no longer laughing" use similar appositive structures, but variety elsewhere offsets. One near-loop: "brittle devotion, strong when untouched, but splintering when pressed" is immediately followed by a rephrasing of that fragility—acceptable because it establishes a motif rather than churn. No simultaneity errors, no scaffolding. The final image—"devotion can bend without breaking if it keeps time"—reprises the brittle motif with earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance discovery or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the photograph-matching sequence is clear and propulsive. Two notable artifacts: "I followed the clue the way my predecessor taught me, by a trail of photographs leading to a forgotten memory" is scaffolding that could be tightened, and "each shingle reflecting the same pale, judgmental sky" stacks metaphor without grounding. The opening and closing lines anchor well. Minor template cadence in the middle third ("One image showed… then in… then in…") but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high: most sentences advance setting, character state, or alchemical action without padding. Minor issues: the phrase "the touch of wonder" appears twice within close proximity, creating conceptual redundancy; "kaleidoscopic" is used identically in two beats without reweighting; and a few lines skew toward lyric decoration without added pressure ("its cold light caught the waterfall's colors, scattering them over her palms" is vivid but static). No loops or template cadence runs, and figurative language remains coherent. Propulsion is steady but not urgent, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and closure, but the middle beat includes a long compound sentence ("I revised the landing coordinates with a calm that felt false, sending him toward the southern crown...") that cycles through multiple actions without pause, creating mild momentum drag. "Soundless echo" appears three times, twice in abstract phrasing ("leaving a soundless echo inside my skull," "repeated every choice as a soundless echo"), which borders on synonym loop and slightly dulls the closure charge. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs, and clarity remains intact. Minor overwriting in figurative density does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases repeat structure: "letting grief and gratitude balance, letting stillness and strike share one breath" and "as if to an opponent and as if to a sibling" use parallelism purposefully, yet other moments cycle near-synonyms ("rewrites had dulled," "rewrite aligned," "rewrites, and the only custody"). The longest sentence (Custodians paragraph) packs cause and backstory efficiently but risks density overload. No major loops or filter stacks, and the opening/closing images anchor well. A few abstract nouns ("clarity," "pretense," "numbness") recur without fresh embodiment, applying modest line-level drag.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse; information density is high (most lines do multiple jobs). The opening sentence ("After the final grain slips through the hourglass, the town goes quiet enough to hear its own breath") is vivid and voice-specific. Minor overwriting in the tunnel sequence: "the lullaby comes back wrong, smeared and hollow, yet inside the wrongness he hears the small giggle" could be tighter, and "trapped in the grime of years" is slightly generic. One template-cadence run: "he kneels and starts to macerate…He grinds them into pulp…he realizes it is trapped…the musician said laughter binds…" (four consecutive "he [verb]" or parallel stems within two sentences) triggers a −0.4 deduction. No loops or paraphrase; clarity is high except for the slight ambiguity around the mist-shapes. The final image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings show variety; information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, and pressure). The opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor artifacts: "he did not speak so much as sniff the air, listening for theft the way wolves listen for blood" stacks two comparisons in one clause, risking slight muddle. "Stepped from between biographies and frost coated roses" juxtaposes incongruous details (books and flowers) without clear spatial logic, though the surreal setting may intend this. One paraphrase near the end: "my homesickness was the same kind of misread map" echoes the guardian's confession without adding new pressure. No loops or scaffold elsewhere; clarity remains strong through peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and density is high, yet several lines loop conceptually: "creative destruction, the kind that tears down a form so something truer can be built from the shards" glosses the concept already dramatized. "Stoically sensitive" recurs as label without embodied cost in peak beats. Mixed metaphors appear: "frozen bloom that held heat and grief" and "soot masked in gray" (soot as person?) blur clarity. Filter-verb reliance ("felt," "seemed," "thought") and elevated diction ("vivify," "tinctures") in high-pressure moments slightly dull immediacy. No scaffold loops, but cumulative drift lowers propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high; sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot without padding. Rhythm varies naturally (compare the compressed mast-drop to the slower tuning sequence). Minor loop: "the towers were chained together like a dead instrument" and "the city...rang with a gentler signal" echo instrument/sound imagery without adding pressure. One instance of slight overwriting: "drove to find the beginning in every ending" and later "beginnings...are built with sore hands" repeat the motif without evolved meaning. Clarity and propulsion are strong; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language (hush "like sand drinks water," mast "like a surrendered spear") is coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies (short pulses: "She traced those lines with her thumb"; longer accretions: "Inside the grotto the air shimmered…"), and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Two paraphrase loops appear: "vanishing midroute…leaving only wake rings" is restated as "the ferry was not sinking but sliding," and the hourglass engraving/route lattice is explained twice in adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence surfaces in the middle third with repeated "she + verb" stems across three consecutive sentences. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats, but the phrase "permanent transient" recurs without functional pressure in one mid-beat. These artifacts do not touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: two distinct issues (paraphrase loop, template cadence) → −1.5 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Since the pneumonia, my thoughts built rooms faster than my hands" = backstory + current state + metaphor). Rhythm varies without template cadence. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor deduction: a few near-echoes in sentence openings ("I did not trust," "I did not say," "I tried to step out," "I understood then") create subtle repetition in the second half, and "rational enchantment" as a coined phrase risks elevated register at the opening, though it's quickly grounded. Closure image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance setting, stakes, or method. Minor template cadence appears in the opening third: "was the year," "was balancedly curious," "was humble and fierce" cluster filter constructions without clear voice motivation. The phrase "hunting for matching radii" and "stitched into arcs that unfolded and overlapped like petals" show strong figurative control. One paraphrase loop: "expand a plain circle into a coordinate net" closely echoes "cartographer might expand a globe into a flat chart without tearing it" within two sentences. Propulsion is steady, though the summary of Jae's role and the council's decision compresses pivotal negotiation into transit.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is mostly sustained. However, multiple sentences open with "Mara" or "She," creating mild template cadence in the middle third. "The hearing aid ticked once in her pocket, a tiny pulse that meant the call was not for comfort but for contact, a chain that needed tracing before it tightened around someone else" stacks clauses that could be tightened. "Persistently curious, the kind who listened past words" leans on appositive summary. No major loops or scaffold, but density dips in expository beats. Information load is high without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density is high: nearly every line advances situation, character texture, or world logic. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, tightening during the gap passage ("Terror crowded her ribs" / "the world itself had loosened"). Figurative language is sparse and functional: "throat of stone," "tired animals," "stranded fish." The codex-page mechanism and phase-transition process are clear without scaffold. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the title phrase with cost. Minor note: "as if it wanted to keep its own secrets" leans slightly decorative but does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Information density is high: most lines advance ritual, memory metaphor, or Mara's internal shift. "After the radio static clears" and "the night returns to the opal observatory under snow" anchor immediately. The ink-spiral and shard-through-ink beats are concretely rendered. Minor scaffold: "Its dome is a pale gem in the drifts, and the telescope points like a sleeping spear" stacks two metaphors in quick succession without added pressure (−0.3). "She keeps the shard in her pocket, its white curve warm from her palm, as if it remembers the hot coffee" is purposeful. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the figurative load is mostly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift between subject-verb, prepositional phrases, and subordinate clauses. Information density is high: "He had not taken it for wealth, but because its imperfections caught vibrations the way clean gems could not" does three jobs (motive, object property, thematic link). Figurative language is selective and integrated: "the canyon returned every shout as a thousand mangled copies," "their throats failed, the canyon kept their meanings, layered in the rock as harmonics." Minor loop: "the diamond vibrated in his hand like an eager mouth" (once) versus "the diamond flashed once, then went still, its curse sated" uses similar vehicle (animate hunger) but transforms it, acceptable as bracket. No paraphrase cycles or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high across most beats: "Edda said Jonas came to her at night, asking for valerian and silence" does character, setting, and plot work simultaneously. However, a paraphrase loop appears mid-story: "notes that refused to settle into any key" and "a harmony untamed" restate the same concept without added pressure. The phrase "as if gravity had learned to smile" and "gravitationally playful" risk register drift into whimsy that tensions the frostbitten tone. Minor scaffold phrasing ("some evenings," "that night") and one template cadence run ("He told," "He spoke," "He asked") across adjacent beats reduce propulsion slightly. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; no major muddle at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates with scene needs. High information density: "sap overlaid by coal," "eroded into polite expressions," "roots chained like a prisoner." No paraphrase loops. The opening anchors voice and stakes; the final line recharges motifs (violin, tree, statues). Minor artifacts: "the city listened best when it could not quite reach him" and "breaking free was not a leap away from the world, but a reshaping of it" edge toward scaffold-phrasing—neat epigrams that slightly externalize the POV. Filter-verb count is low. Propulsion is strong, but two moments of near-summary ("he understood what he had only known") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies well and information density is high in mid-section beats (linking absences, drone timing). Opening and closing paragraphs stack figurative language heavily ("brittle hush," "thin as a folded envelope," "fragile parcel," "whatever absences and weather he had to link") without always grounding them in action. Two minor paraphrase loops: "broken promises heal" echoed without added nuance, and "absences" recurs formulaically. No major causality breaks, but the metaphoric overlay in peak beats (thunderstorm release, final gate step) risks slight opacity. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances the journey, discovery, or repair. Rhythm modulates well from the opening's lyric cadence to the tighter repair sequence. Two frictions: "quietly persistent about interpreting it as possibility" in the opening edges toward abstract summary, and the phrase "every rivet and rope suggest a secret route" stacks metaphor without adding clarity. The final beat ("the abandoned circus train stirred as if ready to carry new possibilities") recycles "possibilities" from the opening, creating a purposeful echo but risking redundancy. No loops or scaffold elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift from participial ("At three," "Between questions") to prepositional to declarative without template cadence. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "She had found it in the returns bin years ago, knotted around a microfilm reel" anchors backstory, object, and time). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Clarity is strong except for one moment: "shifted under her skin like a living proof" leans toward mixed metaphor (grain as proof blurs vehicle). Minor overwriting in cumulative beats: "river water and coal smoke, the way analog memories arrive without asking" stacks metaphor without pattern-teaching, though it remains legible. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Proofreading is clean; no tense slips or pronoun ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm is purposeful and varied, with long accumulative sentences mirroring Mina's obsessive process. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or method. Figurative language—"luminous absence," "cipher of longing," light "throbbing like a heartbeat"—is consistent and voice-motivated. Minor overwriting in the opening: "the docks of the whispering archipelago were still dark" and "paid in shells and silence" stack lyric description before grounding action. Paraphrase loop: "She called those sheets the cipher of longing, because the light arranged itself into loops and cuts like letters, and because anyone who stared long enough began to remember something they had lost" restates the cipher's effect across two clauses without added pressure. No template cadence or pronoun drift; clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is lyric and controlled; sentence openings vary. Line-level clarity is high, though figurative density pervades without significant modulation: "night pooled like ink," "sense of direction slid sideways," "room turned," "old laughter rose like steam." In the climax (Altair naming, silver comma click, idea burst), metaphor stacks without a prose-break to anchor the bodily moment, reducing immediacy. Paraphrase check: "The steps turned into a spiral, then a straight hall, then a staircase again" and the next line "as if the place wanted to disorient me" restate disorientation without added pressure (−0.2). No template cadence or loops beyond that instance. Information density is moderate; many lines prioritize atmosphere over dual-function advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong images (rust and old apples, silted branches, swollen notebook). However, several long sentences pack multiple clauses without relief, and some phrasing loops conceptually: "she learned to dive, traded lecture halls for wetsuit seams, and descended with a lantern to touch the silted branches of trees that once bore pears, each touch an attempt to recover stolen memories by feeling the world remember her back" restates the recovery motive twice. The phrase "feeling the world remember her back" is poetic but slightly precious. Minor template cadence appears in the succession of "she + verb" constructions across beats. No major artifacts touch the closure, so deductions are modest.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    Syntax varies purposefully and rhythm supports the quiet intensity of the scene. Information density is high in most beats (the glass pane traps the afternoon shadow; leaf geometry aligns with door-shaped shadow). Opening and closing lines frame voice and stakes effectively. However, the piece carries noticeable scaffold: paraphrase loops appear ("he agreed to mentor resilience quietly" is restated conceptually when Mara asks "how a library can fight a tribunal"), template cadence runs in exposition blocks ("He has annotated thousands... the margins never tell him..."), and the long opening sentence chains modifiers without clear propulsion. The phrase "combative tenderness" is repeated verbatim three times, reading as thematic label rather than fresh perception. Figurative density in the first third (lung holding breath, shard-mirror, spell behind exile) risks overwriting without pattern payoff. Apply −0.9 for combined loop, template, and metaphor-string issues across the first and middle thirds.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but controlled in most beats. However, overwriting accumulates: nearly every sentence in the opening third carries layered metaphor ("orchard's first buds held their breath," "air itself sounded like a hymn sung under one's tongue," "color of wonder before it leaked from our world"), reducing clarity and momentum in the setup. Template cadence appears in the crossing sequence: "when the parrots…went quiet, he placed…and arranged…and…braided…Then he asked." Paraphrase loop: "the seed swelled, throwing off threads of light" is immediately restated as "a seam only pruners could see." These artifacts cluster but do not obscure the closure beat. Information density is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft shows vivid imagery ("heart of stormlight," "figure of rain and lantern-glow") and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high; most sentences advance setting, action, or stakes. Three distinct issues lower the score: (1) "across sharing a secret" is used identically in paragraphs 6 and 15, creating a template-cadence artifact that reads as unrevised scaffold; (2) several figurative constructions in rapid succession ("interlaced hush," "prismatic threads," "heart of stormlight," "lantern-glow") approach density overload in the closure sequence without clear pattern-teaching; (3) minor clarity slip in "spirits dropped softly to the floor" when the spatial relationship between slab, chamber, and floor is not fully established. Propulsion is strong; paragraph cut test passes. Accumulation cap applies: three issues = −2.0 from a baseline ~8.9, yielding 6.9.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances discovery or reweights prior material. Sentence openings vary, and spatial choreography remains clear across the full sequence. However, several template-cadence and paraphrase artifacts dull momentum: "She carried the reels… compared them… noticed something" and "She set her camera… then where the newer reel had stood, and by comparing" share identical syntactic stems across adjacent clauses. The phrase "silence that felt like permission" echoes "quiet that felt like [X]" stock constructions. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to thicken," "felt her guarded kindness shift") appear in mid-pressure beats without voice motivation. These patterns accumulate to −0.6 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack. Clarity and momentum remain intact, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance discovery or theme. Rhythm varies effectively ("We are circling, and I am done with circles" contrasts with longer descriptive passages). One paraphrase loop: the opening graphs repeat "letting go" and "physics" across multiple lines without added pressure (−0.3). Minor filter-verb cluster in the descent sequence ("I felt Dee hovering," "I sensed his attention sharpen") but does not stack heavily enough to trigger the harsher penalty. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("shelves now pitched like ribs," "ink becomes a bruise"). Clarity and propulsion are strong; no major scaffold or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and stakes simultaneously. Sentence rhythm varies (short spark-strike, longer encoding description) and propels through the tightening window. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor figurative density: three similes in the opening third (sundials like islands, ghost like moth, drum like being carried) without full payoff, approaching but not crossing the −0.3 threshold. Clarity and momentum remain strong through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Strong images like "frozen candle" and "ladder built out of light" carry thematic weight, but the latter borders on purple during a high-pressure beat. Paraphrase loop at "secrets travelled upward only when servants carried them, and she was tired of being merely a carrier" restates the same idea without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the diary-reading sequence: multiple sentences begin with "The [noun]" or "At [floor]." Clarity and propulsion remain strong overall, with strategic telling compressing transit efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies; information density is high ("the envelope of the airship still floated, but without the ground line the gondola drifted sideways into uncharted airspace"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense but controlled: "loose tooth in dusty starlight," "crushed mica in moonlight," "breath fills lungs." Mixed-metaphor check: "quiet explosion of a valve failing" juxtaposes quiet/explosion but reads as intentional oxymoron tied to Mara's "quietly explosive" trait. Small deduction: the phrase "spooled wholeness, a way to wind scattered sky into something you could hold" in the first third stacks three metaphoric vehicles (spool, wind, hold) in quick succession without clear disambiguation, briefly muddling the tenor. This does not touch closure but reduces clarity mid-scene. One filter-verb stack: "she named it Fury because its edges sparkled" could cut "because."

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Figurative language—"shelves spiraled upward like ribs," "smooth as a closed eyelid," "night vault, dot by dot"—is vivid and purpose-driven. Sentence rhythm modulates with urgency. Minor artifacts: "the familiar limit of her mind, the blankness where a face should have anchored a memory" edges into paraphrase redundancy, and "She carried the book to her ladder, opened her tin of pigments, and began to craft the ceiling" lists actions rather than integrating them through embodied perception. The phrase "felt less alone in her defect" risks soft therapeutic phrasing. No loops or scaffold touch the closure beat; clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, though some loops appear: "stranded luminance" recurs without added pressure, and "the light" / "the glow" cycle as synonyms. The phrase "because paper remembered better than people" is polished but feels imported rather than character-particular. Figurative language is dense ("unseen snow," "moving ceiling," "water choosing a channel") and mostly coherent, but "unseen snow" in corners reads strained. The final paragraph's "the starlings wheeled alongside like guides" and "a whole atlas of living radiance" layer metaphor without clear propulsion, risking overwriting at closure. No major clarity breaks, but the texture occasionally prioritizes ornament over momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; many lines advance multiple jobs (sensory detail, world rule, motive). Two micro-loops: "she wanted to understand, and understanding required parts" restates the want without added pressure; "she carried driftwood nostalgia and a new timing" in the final line re-uses "driftwood" from paragraph one without clear reweighting. Figurative density is heavy throughout (frost-lace, sunlight ground into powder, cliffs of shelves) and some metaphors border on mixed (driftwood as patience, then as nostalgia). Template cadence in one passage: "She could pick any lock, but she could not pick time." These artifacts prevent 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully ("the air cooled and a pale figure unfolded"), and information density is high in the opening and grave-reveal beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Serren was altruistic in the plainest way, asking nothing, tending our wounds" repeats the altruism already shown in the prior line. Template cadence runs through the work montage ("Mara… became our foreman; Jai kept the fuel cells alive; I learned…"), and the phrase "brambled hope, scratched and snagging" is poetic but functionally redundant. The closing paragraph stacks summary ("as our patched ship rose… Serren saluted… fading into the milkweed") rather than landing on a concrete final image, dulling propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high, and the prose propels through linked images (pane, puppet, gears, lullaby). However, patterned elevation—"bruised awe," "nested patterns," "vouchsafe," "depthless window"—saturates nearly every paragraph without respite, creating a drumbeat of lyricism that flattens urgency in peak beats. Metaphor density in the transformation passage ("no longer a woman but a quiet correction, a fraction of time stored in brass") borders on opacity. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the register remains uniformly elevated rather than modulating with scene pressure. Figurative saturation in high-pressure moments (the gears demanding payment, the puppet taking her breath) triggers a deduction for overwriting without coherence harm.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with strong figurative control: "stitched-on shadow," "frostless air to bruise bark," "breath stains the stone," "tears steam in the cold air." Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Two minor artifacts lower the score: "offhandedly exact" appears three times without evolving use (paraphrase loop), and "the orchard will look the same, but the path through the labyrinth will not" is serviceable but less charged than prior images. The closing's abstraction ("each impression I leave will be a sign") dilutes momentum slightly. No clarity breaks; grammar and tense are clean. The opening and key beats shine; the final paragraph loses a fraction of propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the foam-insight and bridge-crossing beats. Sentence variety supports momentum, and figurative language (braiding, duet/dirge, stitching) is coherent and load-bearing. Weaknesses: several paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs appear—"she had come to translate... for rivers but for people, for ethics, for the way blame fractures" chains prepositional phrases mechanically; "not to argue but to admit... offer what she could repair" repeats structure without added pressure. The phrase "as proof that change was not betrayal" and "leaving and joining were the same motion" edge toward abstraction rather than concrete image. The final paragraph's "quiet finale" risks stock phrasing. Proofreading is clean; no major artifacts touch the closure beat, but mid-passage scaffold and synonym churn ("distinct until they chose to mingle" echoes prior "split and rejoined") lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative density is high but occasionally borders on opacity: "speech broken into photons," "incise along the doorway's edge, carving a clean curve through pure lack until it shone" stacks metaphor without grounding in physical sensation. One paraphrase loop appears: "the hole where the title should be matched the hollow in me" is echoed by "I wondered if this was my own beginning under a different cover" within two sentences. Information density is strong, and no scaffold or template cadence is evident, but the final third leans heavily on abstraction ("pure lack," "doorway forming") that slightly dulls the closure image's concreteness.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with most sentences doing double duty (e.g., "tasting the air the way other people listened" establishes both ability and habit). Minor template cadence in the pavilion sequence: three consecutive sentences beginning with "The pavilion had / At the center sat / The pavilion had" creates brief monotony. Figurative language is dense but coherent: rain "worrying" the desert, stone that "remembered how to sweat," remorse "sturdy yet brittle as coral." One paraphrase slip: "accepting the contagion" and "let it scrape you raw" restate the same concept across adjacent beats.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose demonstrates purposeful rhythm and selective detail (brass planets, cuckoo weight wrapped in cloth, grain dust rising like incense). However, several passages loop conceptually: "construct bridges from silos" is restated multiple times, and the ending recapitulates theme ("counterweights could move whole structures") that the prior action has already shown. Elevated diction ("empathetically decisive," "tender, vigorous decision," "harmonious choral librarian") in peak beats inflates register without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in the climactic sequence ("some laughed…some softened, and then…") which compresses complex group dynamics into a summary list. The multilingual repetitions serve voice but border on ornamental when unvaried. Propulsion is present but momentum sags under thematic scaffolding in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled ("breath pooling in ledges like quiet water," "memories snagged on hers like burrs on cloth"). However, repeated metaphor stems and elevated constructions cluster without pattern-teaching: "tremor in her ribs," "cracked open and spilled strangers," "fear quake through her reverie," "moon fractured into a dozen pale eyes." The backstory block mid-story paraphrases the miner subplot rather than dramatizing it in a prior beat, creating mild loop effect. Sentence openings vary, but figurative density in high-pressure beats (mirror warming, images spilling) approaches overwriting without the payoff of concrete physical cost. Clarity holds; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance multiple jobs (e.g., "He scattered three vigilance seeds at the crossing, and watched them float, then settle into a crack that was suddenly a stair"). Rhythm varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops appear. Minor overwriting clusters in the opening third: "prism-minded" + "cipher manuals, funeral songs, and the blank spaces between them" + "quiet summons" stacks elevated register without immediate pressure justification. Template cadence appears twice in mid-section ("He stepped forward…" / "He followed the spiral…"), but remains legible. The closure beat is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high—most lines advance tactile discovery or wire mechanics. Two frictions: (1) the opening sentence runs long with nested clauses ("symphonically minded since childhood, yet she has never heard an orchestra, only the hush…"), slightly dulling momentum, and (2) "intensely quiet" in the penultimate paragraph repeats the tone descriptor from midpoint without added pressure. No paraphrase loops, no template cadence. Figurative language ("like a pale moon," "like a held breath") remains coherent and sparse. Overall clarity and propulsion are strong; the line-level slips do not touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines doing double work (the worry stone both embodies and symbolizes his stance). However, several passages edge into overwriting: "the posture of a man still teaching invisible students," "measuring breath in a sickroom," and the extended book-pages simile for Mera's face feel decorative rather than propulsive. Template cadence appears in the middle section with repeated "He [verb]" constructions. The loops don't obscure causality but they slow momentum in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Several passages exhibit overwriting and synonym churn: "pre-ignition silence, communal, held in the throat like a shared secret" and "tuning frequencies on his homemade resonator, searching for the one note" pile figurative density without advancing the beat. Template cadence appears in adjacent clauses ("he set," "then began," "and he felt"). Stock metaphors (clasp as "solidified silence") and elevated diction ("theatrical sincerity," "with hairline turns") in peak beats reduce immediacy. Information density is uneven; some sentences loop concepts ("the path to empathy began by refusing to break what another heart had tried to close" restates the premise without new pressure). Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high and most lines advance character, setting, or stakes. The opening sentence ("At the turning of the tide's thought, when the sea wind paused as if listening to itself") is lyrical but does not clarify time or urgency, creating minor orientation friction. A few phrases edge toward overwriting: "olfactorily sensitive" is clinical, "corpse flower seed… to make a medicine that could teach the body serenity within motion" is abstract. The bloom scene is vivid and propulsive. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and syntax varies purposefully across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings and lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: gravity inversion mechanics, water navigation, arrow-tip discovery, seedling test, and echo origin compressed without redundancy. Minor template cadence in early exposition ("she had learned," "she had dismissed," "she decided") and one paraphrase loop ("the arrow tip grew warm…tugging her") slightly flatten momentum. The final image—pressing the arrow into the stone tree—propels cleanly. No metaphor muddle or scaffold in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propels; information density is high. Minor loop artifacts: "the patch warmed in my hand" echoes prior tactile cues without advancing new pressure; "the patch, now tied to a pole, fluttered hard enough to cut my fingers" partially revisits the injury motif. Figurative density ("air behaved like a liquid," "sound returned in a rush") appears frequently but remains legible and voice-consistent. A handful of near-synonyms ("muted rhythm," "muting people") and one template stem run ("I came to the container yard... I set my... I began documenting...") in early exposition. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase and stem repetition, preventing 8.5+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance image, causality, or thematic charge. Figurative language is purposeful and internally coherent ("aurora thread," "resin swallowing fireflies," "ice over deep water"). Syntactic variety supports rhythm, and the opening grounds voice and stakes cleanly. However, the piece carries scaffold artifacts: "I realize the silence is a prison that will unfetter nothing unless I do the opposite and unfetter her voice" loops "unfetter" and explicates the solution mid-crisis rather than letting action speak; "oscillating repose in frozen walls" drops the prompt phrase into narration as a theme label; and the Council paragraph compresses multiple causal steps ("I play… until even the rationers weep. Afterward they stamp a charter") into summary when dramatization would sharpen closure cost. Filter-verb density ("I feel it settle," "I watch a pale aurora," "I realize") is moderate but present in key beats, slightly dulling immediacy. Paraphrase-loop check: "the hush clenches, sculpted too well" and "the silence is a prison" restate the same condition within two lines. Apply −0.8 in Q7 for scaffold + loop + late summary that touches closure terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: most lines advance situation, image, or choice. Rhythm varies purposefully (long meditative beats at setup, compressed action during the crossing). Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled: "avalanchingly quiet," "surfaces of listening," "corridor made of echo and cold light" are vivid without muddle. Minor proximity concern: "the canyon had swallowed him as neatly as fog" and "water into sand" within close range, but both serve clarity and momentum. Sentence openings vary; no scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high, with most sentences doing double work (the equation wrapper both describes and prefigures mechanism). Rhythm modulates effectively from compressed opening ("between the vanishing stars") to the slowed final ledger image. Two frictions lower the score: near-synonym loops appear in the middle section ("disorient...disoriented...disorienting" across three sentences; "borrowed personalities" recurs without reweighting), and the phrase "transposed empathy" itself feels like a prompt-label rather than discovered language. The closure beat remains clean, so the accumulation cap holds deductions to −0.8 total.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most sentences layer action, memory, and thematic resonance. Rhythm varies appropriately—longer accumulative sentences in reflective beats, shorter when the pendant stirs or Mara speaks. The phrase "by vibrating sympathetically" appears twice in close succession with nearly identical syntax, creating a minor template-cadence slip (−0.4). "The vibration did not shake stones loose; instead it extended brief encounters that had never met, stitching Rook's memories…" is a strong, propulsive line. Opening and closing images are charged. No major loops or scaffold, but the repeated construction around "vibrating sympathetically" and the recurrence of "brief encounters" in multiple forms slightly dulls momentum in the climax third.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening anchors voice ("In the quartz arbor in mist behind the salvage yard, I met Lio") and final line charges closure ("it had absorbed her emotions until someone attentive came to hear them, and in hearing, I finally let her go"). Information density is high—most lines do double work (prism as witness, frost as map). Two frictions: a cluster of synonym loops mid-story ("drank it...drank it...drank it" reads as patterned emphasis but borders on churn) and one template-cadence run ("The mirror flared, and...I heard...yet the car held...and I was"). Modest figurative density ("like water in stone," "like a curtain being drawn") supports rather than overwhelms, though "eyes stayed soft and exact" is generic. No major opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the weaving sequence. Deduction: paraphrase loop in opening two sentences (silence as thread / years as strand sliding away). Repeated phrase "raveling silence" appears five times, twice in identical constructions ("through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry"), creating template cadence. The phrase "stoically sparkling" (bead trait) recurs verbatim without variation. Figurative density in early paragraphs (silence as thread, years as strand, seasons as cards) slightly slows momentum before the market-day beat.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high, compressing weeks of work into efficient beats. Two friction points lower the score: (1) paraphrase loop in the opening—"orchard planet riddled with floating rock arches" and "the arches began shedding rubble into the orchards" restate the setup without added pressure; (2) "timeframe, between understanding and confusion, where he knew he had lost something but could not name it, like a fruit you taste only after it is gone" is evocative but slows momentum at a pivotal beat with metaphor that explains rather than propels. Minimal scaffold elsewhere; no major template cadence runs.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high, with most sentences advancing setting, character, or pressure ("Its green edge caught the bay lights and redirected them into a thin line across the far wall, and in that line I heard, faintly, my mother's voice saying, You promised"). Several long sentences risk opacity ("Every cycle of my life had been like this, calm days punctured by leaps that were cyclically spontaneous, arriving on a rhythm I could sense but never schedule") but remain syntactically clear. Minor paraphrase loop: "the withheld truth" appears three times in similar framing without added pressure. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, and the final beat lands cleanly with concise action.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density: "the island exhaled," "a throat refusing to sing," "the wind pushed at the panes." Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language coheres (bottle, breath, light as eye). Two minor artifacts lower the score: the phrase "after the lamp flickers out" appears twice with tense inconsistency, and "the haunted lantern room" is named identically in two separate paragraphs, reading as a minor loop. No paraphrase cycles or template cadence runs; the closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (glass wick "drank flame," beam as "green spear") is vivid and mostly coherent. Information density is high in the climax (lantern housing opened, wick half-withdrawn, shadows cast). Template-cadence artifacts appear: "I + [past verb]" stems recur across adjacent lines in the storm sequence ("I opened," "I had preserved," "I tore," "I admitted"), creating mild scaffold. Minor synonym churn ("turned," "shifted," "redirected") and one paraphrase loop ("trying to deny what it had summoned, broke into a brighter peal, shadowed elation") slightly dull momentum. No loops touch the closure beat directly, limiting deduction, but cumulative line-level drag prevents entry to high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "a blue morpho wing pressed flat in paper, shimmering even in shadow" anchors object, stakes, and tone). However, several figurative constructions cluster densely in the opening third ("shawl of mist," "patient lantern," "bloom into a different person") without pattern-teaching, edging toward purple. Minor paraphrase loop: "the donor had not given me a plot, but a practice" restates the magnetism lesson already visible in prior beats. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; prose is clean but occasionally weighted with metaphor during setup rather than peak action.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies (short declaratives, longer accumulative clauses) and information density is high. Several beats show paraphrase loops: "The maze was not for tourists; it was a municipal instrument" is immediately restated conceptually, and the sapling's grief-weight is described twice in adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the final third: "I followed… I felt… I set… I waited… I realized… I worked." Filter-verb stacks ("I heard," "I felt," "I wanted," "I realized," "I understood") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy by −0.5. The closure beat ("I filed no report; I simply reset") is clean and propulsive. Total artifact penalty: −0.8 for loops and cadence; −0.5 for filter stacks = −1.3, landing the score at 6.4.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and opening/closing images frame effectively. Information density is high in many beats (mica window introduction, loom description, swaddling sequence). Critical weakness: pervasive template cadence and figurative density in peak beats. The weaving sequence stacks abstract metaphors ("glimmers from the mica window and from the chemists tired eyes, turning those glimmers into thread that warmed her fingers like breath held too long") without clear physical grounding, and the climax deploys mixed registers ("opening a seam where dawn could spill") that blur tactile logic. Minor paraphrase loop: "bound release" and "binding the darkness...promising to release the light" restate without adding pressure. Filter-verb stacks and elevated diction in high-pressure beats dull immediacy and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high, and the piece moves without stalling. However, paraphrase loops appear: "he found a crumpled invitation shoved under his door, the paper creased as if someone had tried to hide it" repeats the idea of concealment, and "the Index of Unfinished Things, yet the address was simply 'Gallery Three, open hours,' a mistake so obvious" restates the error without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs through several paragraphs: "He had chosen… The invitation's wrong… Marin hid… A young docent… His empathy…" with identical [Subject] [past verb] openings. Figurative language clusters in the opening ("empathy… like a confession," "lamplight pooled like honey") without clear payoff at closure. The final note avoids these patterns and lands cleanly, but earlier beats accumulate −0.8 in non-closure artifact debt.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully ("She was a creeping normality noticer" vs. the shorter beats during planting). Opening and closing images charge each other (bricked bakery / sprout through mortar). Minor deductions: "heuristically gentle, always testing what kindness might work" is a scaffold phrase that tells rather than shows; "small green arguments against forgetting" borders on purple without undermining clarity. One paraphrase loop ("the ordinary was edited away" / "one more erasure") in early paragraphs. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Information density is high ("each jar, once opened, shed its illusion into air and then into memory"). Minor repetitive stems appear: "He [verb]" construction recurs across five sentences in the Lumen Room sequence, though not clustered enough to trigger the −0.4 template penalty. One paraphrase loop: "to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" / "the act of keeping had changed him" restates the same insight. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "slow ink" for auroras is fresh. No clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and syntactic variety. Information density is high (most lines advance character, goal, or atmosphere). Minor template cadence in the false-starts section: "Her first false start… Second false start… Near midnight she found…" reads slightly mechanical. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. The figurative language ("lanterns rocked like tired fireflies," "thunder through a bedpost") is coherent and voice-consistent. Closure image is clear. Deduction for the template cadence in the middle third prevents 8+ reach.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere or plot (e.g., "the ring translated them into a subtle pull"). However, several runs show template cadence: "I came there because... I needed to know... I followed that hum... I raised my glowing hands..." anchors many beats with first-person stem repetition. The phrase "terrestrially cosmic gravity" and "futurist ritual wearing an antique tenderness" risk ornamental abstraction without grounding in concrete action. No paraphrase loops, but the opening sentence's clause stack ("When the forests held elections, the sky above New Cascadia flickered with polling drones and old northern lights, like history trying to remember itself") front-loads figurative weight. Clarity remains intact; momentum drags slightly in the middle exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the descent sequence, but overwriting clusters in metaphoric runs: "frozen music," "auroral sorrow," "crystallized as if the cave has been waiting." The lock-picking beat includes both a canvas decoy and a crystal wedge with remembered diagrams—mechanically dense yet the double-layered solution obscures causality slightly. A paraphrase loop appears: "the lock is not merely closed but ruined" echoes "another small betrayal," restating without added pressure. Template stems recur ("she touches," "she realizes," "she decides"), applying −0.5 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact policy.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, world, or pressure. Minor template cadence appears in the conduit sequence: "She reread... asked... understood... wrote" stacks protagonist-verb stems without variation, and "by dawn she had..." plus "When she reached..." are slight scaffold openers. No paraphrase loops or metaphor muddles touch the closure beat. Figurative language ("paper scraps floated like jellyfish," "words that had never been said aloud") remains legible and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive with varied sentence rhythms, but accumulates minor artifacts: "seasonally mute" appears three times in identical phrasing, "the fragment" is repeated as a stem across multiple paragraphs, and "truth" appears eight times, creating semantic saturation. The opening ("After words became unnecessary, the last conversations lived in vibration") is striking, but the final stretch summarizes rather than dramatizes: "By the time the trader returned for payment, the fragment was gone" compresses what could have been charged into retrospective telling. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems across non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "He reduced the drawings and relics to a single black bead, fear made portable"). Minor template-cadence slip: "He searched…he chose…He set…He carried…He buried…He walked" runs parallel stems across the second half, but each advances action rather than paraphrasing. "Fragmented wholeness" as a phrase borders stock philosophical, yet it's anchored in the bead's compression/cooling cycle. No loops or synonym churn. Slight penalty for "strangely organic grain" appearing only as description in the opening without tactile consequence until the ribs flex later—mild scaffold lag, not a break.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and clarity is high throughout. Minor scaffold appears: "I realize the mailbox was locked not to hide the letters, but to delay them…" explains what the scene has already shown. A few stock metaphors ("voices braid together like windblown sand," "dry leaves") lack specificity. No loops or grammatical errors; information density is solid. The explain-everything moment in the penultimate paragraph costs a half-point.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is ambitious and often striking ("door scabbed with coral," "water surged in a thin sheet, cold as diagnosis"), but several lines overreach into mixed metaphor or opacity: "calm defiance was the only dry thing she could breathe" conflates tactile and respiratory metaphors awkwardly. Template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "she opened her waterproof journal and began writing entries... Each entry looked like a poem... but the true instructions were in the rhythm..." (paraphrase loop). Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching, and some constructions blur rather than sharpen: "time as a spider spins its web" is poetic but functionally vague as a timeframe anchor. Information density is strong in the middle beats, but the opening paragraph front-loads metaphor that could be tightened. No grave artifacts touch the closure image itself.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; vivid images ("crystals rose like glass cities," "silence shone so hard it felt like a blade") carry density. Two artifact clusters lower the score: synonym loops ("deleted," "release," "exhume" cycle without adding pressure), and the phrase "the pull fluctuates mysteriously" repeats verbatim from Maru's teaching into narration without fresh context. The closure beat remains clean. Proofreading is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop or paraphrase: "smoothed hush" appears three times, "terrestrially cosmic" twice; "code" and "prophecy" cycle through adjacent lines without added pressure. The metaphor "a silence polished until it could slide between syllables" is vivid, but "tranquil blaze, like a hearth seen through gauze" mixes warm and obscuring registers without clear physical logic. Template cadence appears in the backstory block ("Her teacher had called it…" / "To make it, she worked by…"). The crane-wing mechanics (missing half, second wing made of quiet, joining) are poetic but not entirely legible as action. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.3)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "steam were a script," "meteors stitched white seams," "faded into the mortar like a word finally understood." One mixed metaphor: "I came up there whenever the masonry below began whispering" pairs oddly with "roof made me listen"—does masonry whisper or must the narrator listen harder? A minor paraphrase loop: "agreed the Dovetail was beyond saving" / "tenants had agreed to different lies" / "agreed upon lies bought time"—three "agreed" stems in quick succession. Information density is strong overall; most lines advance plot or world. No scaffold or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("quarantined from the day and released only under supervision"). However, minor loops appear: "tragically radiant" recurs three times across the text without clear reweighting, and the penultimate beat paraphrases the workshop plan twice ("translate… locked days into skills, maps, and plans" then "survival became a kind of independence"). The closure sentence ("memory safe enough to carry forward") is clean, but overwriting in the Memory Ward passage—stacked metaphors of jars, humming, frequencies, leaking—slightly blurs immediacy without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance situation or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the stalactite refrain teaches a pattern that brackets the action. Opening and closing images (pearl twilight, aurora) bookend effectively. However, line-level artifacts cluster: "wisely enduring" appears twice as label-only descriptor without embodied cost in adjacent context; "calibrated treason" is defined in exposition rather than shown; minor synonym churn ("forger/forgery," "unfinished/unfinish"). Template cadence in backstory exposition ("Years ago...thinking she was saving lives, but Senn showed..."). Figurative language occasionally stacks without payoff ("green veils reflected," "ink basin rotated without a click" is precise, but "as if the cave remembered summer" is decorative). No loops touch the closure beat directly, so deductions remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language ("moon bone," "reed-blown melancholy," "star-silver rocks") creates texture without overwhelming clarity. Minor loops: "echo" recurs heavily in exposition; "threads" and "voice" are leaned on throughout. The middle journey section lists three shell disclosures in sequence without varied syntax, creating a summary feel. No major artifacts or grammatical errors, but density dips in the travel montage where episodic beats are paraphrased rather than dramatized. The closure image is clean, but the reunion sentence ("walked out with Jaro") is generic and undercuts the line-level charge.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: most sentences do two jobs (e.g., "candles borrowed starlight through the ice, tinting every flame with a cold blue" establishes atmosphere and primes the closure image). Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths modulate with pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Mild overwriting in the opening: "a snow globe, or what remained of it, its glass collapsed and melted into a lopsided teardrop that still held a blur of water and silver grit" stacks modifiers without functional differentiation between "collapsed" and "melted." The phrase "borrowed starlight" appears three times, twice in nearly identical context, risking decorative repetition. The long sentence describing Fen's brazier method compresses action that might warrant a beat; clarity holds but momentum drags slightly. Grammar and usage are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high: each beat advances teaching, relationship, or the smuggler plot. Rhythm varies with purpose, accelerating during the investigation sequence. Opening and closing images anchor voice and reweights stakes. Minor scaffold: "See, he said softly, hidden patterns are not secrets kept from us; they are the paths our eyes refuse because they are made of small repetitions" and "Jiro explained that every repair was a philosophy" edge toward exposition rather than dramatization. Paraphrase micro-loop in "honoring the hidden effort that kept every net, wall, and heart from tearing" (final line) recaps theme without fresh pressure. No template cadence or filter stacks; metaphors remain coherent. Deduction totals −0.6 for expository moments and minor loop at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance investigation or world logic. Sentence variety is present but several adjacent beats use similar "I [verb]" stems, creating mild template cadence in the journey and orchard-entry sequence. One paraphrase loop: "debunker reads a hoax, for what it tries to hide" echoes the earlier "sharply observant… survival habit" without added pressure. Clarity is strong; causality and spatial choreography remain legible throughout. The "comfort line" / "comfortable lies" phrase recurs purposefully to charge theme, so pattern-teaching holds. Overwriting is minimal—figurative language ("bones under sand," "walls" of storms) is precise and spaced. Proofreading is clean. The final beat's syntax ("betting that in the cracks…") is dense but legible, fitting the investigative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high, and many lines do double work (setting + character + theme). Rhythm varies, though some passages lean into lyric density at the expense of propulsion ("the stormlit observatory…shuddered like a tin lantern, its dome ringing with rain that never touched the world below"). No major loops or scaffolding. A few constructions feel slightly overwrought ("the rise of a prophet" is vague; "variant allegiance" and "lyrically prophetic" are label-heavy). The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Minor clarity issue: "across the rise of a prophet" is temporally imprecise, and some metaphors (cobalt glass as "blue bruise") strain coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and conflict. Rhythm varies naturally with longer opening and closing paragraphs framing shorter action beats. Two minor loops: "positively wistful" appears twice as label without fresh embodiment; "dawn's earliest whistle" bookends the piece as frame but the second use adds no new pressure. Template cadence in one run: "He carried...set...opened...fed" stacks without variation, though the sequence is clear. Stock metaphors: "snag on broken teeth," "bridges on a trembling span," "inhaled" (for a spring) blur precision. The final image—"redemption gathered from scraps settle at last in his chest"—is evocative but edges toward abstraction. Proofreading is clean; no grammar or tense errors.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; figurative language is dense ("old ribcage," "teeth caught the last gold light like a tiny crown," "blood into bandage") but mostly coherent. Two issues lower the score: **paraphrase loops** ("he wanted their craving to loosen, the way salt loosens a knot" restates the sonic-absolution effect already shown) and **overwriting in the climax**—"adjusted his strike, nudging the pitch until the dock's groan and the fork's ring aligned. The aligned tone made the planks shiver" recycles the alignment concept across adjacent sentences. Register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("fleshly ethereal," "vibrational matching") that feels imported rather than embodied. No major artifacts touch closure directly, so the penalty remains moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, setting, or pressure. Rhythm varies naturally, with longer accumulative sentences ("The monastery kept charts...by the black marks they left on the snowbound horizon") alternating with shorter tactical beats ("At dawn the empire found the viaduct intact but useless"). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the horizon motif. Minor weaknesses: a few phrases approach template cadence ("not by battle but by refusing to hurry, refusing to break") and the sentence "she promised them that patience was not surrender but a shape they could carve together" edges toward thematic statement within a high-pressure beat. "Restrained wildness...like a wolf behind a half opened door" is vivid but slightly strained. No paraphrase loops or major scaffolding; clarity and propulsion are intact.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high—most sentences advance evidence, memory, or decision. Syntax varies purposefully, and the rhythm supports pressure (short beats during evidence collection, longer flows for entangled memories). Template-cadence penalty: multiple "the [noun] + past-tense-verb" constructions across adjacent lines ("the object made no sense," "the entangled memories tightened," "the lantern's flame chamber smelled") create a subtle drumbeat that flattens propulsion in the middle third. Figurative language is mostly controlled, though "his voice sliding through her earpiece like oil" and "reverberate into silence" edge toward stock metaphor without fresh vehicle. No loops or paraphrase; clarity remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, conflict, or atmosphere. The phrase "aptly deliberate" appears twice in identical construction (Elias, then Darren), creating a template echo that slightly dulls momentum. A few figurative choices border on precious ("vibrant hush," "storm clouds") but remain legible. Minor paraphrase loop: "second opinion" is restated conceptually in adjacent beats without added pressure. No major clarity issues; the final image propels cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and syntactic variety. Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or plot without padding. Opening "The workshop floated on an acid sea like a stubborn coin" anchors voice and stakes immediately. Minor loop: "the etched marks" appears three times in close proximity (central bench paragraph, loupe paragraph, glider installation) without functional variation; "marks" could vary to "spiral" or "pattern" once. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful—"as if it missed its own childhood," "hot wind that smelled like pennies"—but "gears-and-cogs" as compound descriptor feels slightly stock. One paraphrase slip: "the yearning algorithm" is named identically four times; synonym variation (e.g., "the pattern," "the recursive rule") would tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally; the opening establishes voice and stakes with "I am Mara Sato, the corporate memory keeper for Lattice, hired to sit in the social network archive where every post is preserved, and to listen for what the database refuses to say." Information density is high in the investigation beats: "They show up as comment counts, as time stamps on old videos, as checksum fragments on backups, and even as the track numbers of forgotten songs that users streamed in 2009 before the playlists were wiped." Minor loop issue: "I report the anomaly to my manager, then lie again, claiming it is a harmless indexing glitch" and later "In the morning I walk into Legal...and I lie one last time" create a paraphrase cycle around the lying action without adding pressure. Template-cadence check: several sentences in the middle third follow identical stems ("The trail repeats...I have always wanted...At midnight..."). Figurative language is controlled and purposeful ("threads look like roads," "choir muffled by dust"), but the phrase "singing its thin electrical lullaby" edges toward purple without earning the elevation. No major artifacts obscure causality or closure, but the accumulation of minor loops and template stems prevents entry into higher bands. Deduction range: −0.6 for loops and stems, totaling within the non-closure cap.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; nearly every line advances character, world, or pressure. However, several lines loop conceptually: "watched them in the weighted breath before reply" recurs identically, "the fragment" and "the shard" are used interchangeably without added nuance, and "courageous anomaly" appears twice in close succession. The phrase "shadow-laced peacekeeper" and "reconstitute the old crystal ball by aligning the shard with the mirror-glimpses it awakened" carry slight overwriting that slows momentum in peak beats (−0.6 for loops and register drift).

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template runs except one brief cluster ("The tip was..."; "Each tap taught..."). Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure—but two minor paraphrase moments ("endings announce themselves softly" near "rehearsing its last note") and one filter-verb stack ("heard under their voices the same tremor I heard") slightly dull immediacy. The metaphor "lungs were closing like wet paper" is vivid; "trawl for signs" pays off the debris-trawling action. No loops touch the closure beat. Figurative language is dense but coherent; the final image ("endings approach like weather") lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (the opening bus sigh, clipped exchanges, the longer pavilion meditation), and imagery is specific ("burned edge…curled and crisp," "wires hummed faintly"). However, several beats loop or paraphrase adjacent content: "honored each other best by meeting in the same present" echoes "shared field where her fear and my regret could be seen," and the closing sentence rehearses the intersubjective-understanding claim already staged. Metaphor density is high but coherent (amber = warmth = preservation; vines = graft = relationship logic). The "passionate subtlety" formulation in the climax reads slightly thesis-like, breaking immediacy. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and minor template cadence in reflective stretches, with an additional −0.2 for the abstraction slip at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening anchors voice and tone. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "a murmuring pavilion of stitched linen breathed with low voices and kettle steam"). Clarity holds through complex action (the dawn rite sequence). Minor overwriting: "the kinetic parapet, a buried ringwall that shifted when footsteps approached" stacks descriptors, and "Each confessed doubt was a stone set true" risks metaphor clarity. Paraphrase micro-loop: paragraphs 12–13 restate the elders' fear and Iri's prior rite without added pressure. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies across the piece; opening and storm beats propel while reflective passages breathe. Information density is high in the acetate-placement beats, but paraphrase loops appear: "let the scent soften" echoes "lingered among the purple rows," and "arcs were the town's real map" is restated as "she believed those arcs." Template cadence surfaces in the storm paragraph: "nobody ran; they held… and laughed… as if rescuing…" chains actions without varied stems. Stock metaphor "the factory stood like a bad riddle" and elevated diction "transmute pain into a masterpiece" drift from Mara's established voice during peak beats. Opening and final lines anchor effectively (vines climbing, masterpiece finished), and the acetate-fence image recurs with reweighted meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clean and legible with strong imagery (chandelier as nest, vines shaped like letters, paper skins shedding). However, several phrases loop or paraphrase: "suspended hush" recurs without evolving function, and "the suspended hush was not a curse but a cradle" in the final paragraph restates theme rather than trusting the image. Template stems appear: "Sequence one," "Sequence two," "Sequence three" are functional but scaffold-like. Minor filter-verb stacks ("I showed," "I saw," "I heard") in the sequences dull immediacy. Information density is high, but the closure beat leans on summary ("So I testified that...") rather than concrete action, reducing propulsion at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("cases furred with salt and dust," "pale branch like an arrow that pointed not north but toward a feeling"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or stakes. However, several paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "hush of the unwatched videotapes seemed to leak into the air" recurs in varied forms; "echo" and "hush" and "fog" are invoked repeatedly without always adding new pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("After every marker he paused, frowned, and asked…") and stacked filter verbs ("she imagined," "she would answer," "she heard") reduce propulsion. The closure image is clean and evocative, but mid-passage scaffold costs ~0.8. No single artifact obscures causality, so penalty remains in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high ("the hand fed the drive motors, and the drive motors fed the hand"), and the prose propels without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes. Minor overwriting in the phrase "the luminous ache of the shaking night" and "thin cloud seas rolled far below like silent surf"—two consecutive figurative turns in a high-pressure beat—slightly blur focus. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well—long sentences for Mara's calm, shorter beats at the reunion—and most lines carry double duty. Clean grammar and pronoun clarity throughout. Overwriting clusters in figurative density: "jagged as a shard of night," "hope, clean and possible," "clouds parting" in close succession without pattern-teaching or payoff beyond atmosphere. Template cadence appears in the hymning catalog ("water cup, call button, window latch, worn socks") and again in "footsteps and door hinges," which reads mechanically parallel. The phrase "reunify before his breath runs out" and "reunify would not mean surrender" repeat "reunify" (the prompt action verb) in a way that feels scaffolded rather than character-particular. Minor paraphrase loop: "the old hymn rises with scratches like tender confessions" and "Mara keeps singing softly over the vinyl, hymning the mundane" restate the same image within two sentences. High information density in the setup and reunion; momentum sags slightly in the middle exposition about the phone call and dock meeting. Artifacts touch but do not obscure closure, so deductions remain within-band.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most sentences advancing knowledge or image. Two paraphrase loops stand out: the automaton's "sealed awakenings" purpose is restated twice in adjacent lines, and the "loops not lines" rule recurs without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the mirror-corridor beat ("showed...missing") and the final paragraph ("folded and stacked like letters," "drawn through those circles"). No figurative muddle or metaphor clash. Minor scaffolding in the exposition of the mentor's rule and the automaton's function slightly dulls momentum before the door-opening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or causality. Rhythm varies appropriately (shorter sentences during the jaw examination, longer accumulative ones in the garden). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting in the opening: "a forgiving skeptic who never mocked grief but distrusted legends" front-loads exposition that could unfold through action. "Shrewdly innocent" appears three times, risking motif over-emphasis. Figurative language ("constellations," "polished seeds," "living branches") remains coherent and voice-matched. The final line's compression—"determined to chart whatever came next"—delivers propulsion without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.0)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or causality. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, minor scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "with each circle he worked, more of his buried recollections loosened" immediately followed by a colon-list that re-states "recollections"; "weighed that guilt the way he weighed his brass star charts" loops the weighing metaphor within one sentence. The phrase "reflectively vibrant" appears twice in identical form (sea glass, then pearl glow). Template cadence in the teaching epilogue: "to gather… to weigh… to polish" reads mechanical. Apply −0.6 for loops and template phrasing touching multiple beats but not closure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "cracked beehive," "servers lay like tombstones under green quilts," "honeyed hush," "confession could be compost." Two slips lower the band: "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is near-cliché therapy-speak, and "leak shaped code into medicine" mixes vehicle (leak/medicine) without clear tenor. Rhythm varies, sentence openings differ, and no paraphrase loops appear. Information density is strong—most lines do double work (e.g., pendant description anchors both relic and encryption signature). Propulsion is solid through the archive-building sequence and Jun's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes ("Inside the whisper of closing pages" → "quiet, multiple shapes of hope"). Information density is high in most beats; many lines do double work (the shell both warms and seeps letters; the baker glances back and the glance "turned into a small, warm loaf"). Clarity is generally strong, though a few beats approach density overload ("drawing a map toward a feral nexus in mist" and "the wind had teeth, and yet every sound was wrapped in the same hush" layer metaphor on metaphor without pause). Minor loop: "whisper" and "hush" recur across four beats without added pressure in the middle; "closing pages" appears three times. The phrase "shapes of different hopes" and "gathered shapes" repeat across adjacent paragraphs without variation. Template-cadence run: "She tucked… She understood… She wrote…" in close succession. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems, −0.3 for filter-verb stack ("She understood then," "She wrote," "She laid"). No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so cap non-closure deductions at −0.4 per the priority check, yielding net −0.7 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several paraphrase loops and template constructions appear: "not to entertain, but to remember" / "not with words at first, but with..."; "stories they sang" / "the restored rite"; "listening to wood" / "listen for the moment." The final third carries mild register drift ("sacred practices are not machines that work without people" reads thesis-like). These artifacts dull momentum in mid-beats but do not obscure the closure image, so penalties remain within the non-closure cap.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (orchard as metronome, stars biting like teeth) is vivid. However, scaffold phrases recur: "she came here because," "she meant to," "she understood that" cluster in exposition. The opening sentence runs long with nested clauses, and a paraphrase loop appears ("safekept starlight" recurs four times without variation). Template cadence in the sealing sequence ("she knelt until," "she traced," "she pressed") flattens momentum. Clarity remains high, but density suffers from these loops, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q7 for pattern artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is ambitious and often vivid ("quick silver lines," "sharp tap and then a softer copy"), but several lines accumulate figurative density without clear pattern-teaching: "metal remembered when it cooled," "harvest of echoes," "surfaces were not only metal; they were sound, light, and the uneasy gap between them." This clusters metaphorical weight in the opening third without on-page payoff until the end. Sentence openings vary well; no template cadence or loops. The figurative muddle in early beats applies a −0.6 deduction within Q7 for density without coherence, but the closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    High information density and purposeful figurative work ("silence layered on silence," "drowned constellations"). Rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Two minor deductions: "cupped like a whale's rib" and later "whalebone" risk redundancy, and "shingled hush: silence layered on silence, each panel overlapping" paraphrases itself within one sentence (−0.2 paraphrase loop). Figurative density is high but coherent; no muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong rhythm and varied sentence structure; opening "Rain stitched the skylight" and closing "ember refusing to die" frame effectively. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme). Minor artifacts: "here and gone" recurs three times in similar phrasing without taught pattern payoff at closure, trending toward loop (−0.3). "Rust hued" appears twice in close proximity. A few filter verbs ("she told herself," "she understood") dull immediacy in mid-beats. Figurative language (steam/crystals, ember/circle) is coherent and supports closure, avoiding muddle. No major scaffold or template cadence, but the recurrence and filters prevent highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is vivid and imagistic but heavily figurative throughout, with metaphor density high even in expository beats: "clouds rub their bellies against the struts," "developed later on the undersides of her eyelids," "where the cloudlight is thin." Several lines loop or restate: "she is tired of running in circles that never move" echoes "keep the horses circling forever and prove she could outrun loss." The phrase "the ghost rises as a wavering outline…and it speaks first with the bride's laugh" is then immediately paraphrased: "The ghost demands payment for peace." Template cadence appears in the middle third: "Once, before her ambitions…" / "Now she wants only…" / "The ghost lives…" / "Regret has taught her…" Clarity is serviceable but the figurative density and some paraphrase loops apply −0.6 to −0.8 in Q7. Strong imagery but not zero-artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, information density high in technical sequences. Some figurative overlap in mid-passage: "intentions had outlived their makers" followed closely by "held them like stale air" risks overwriting but remains legible. "She did not call it repair; she called it resurrect" reads slightly scaffolded. One paraphrase near the architect's office (maze personal/not bureaucratic; broken on purpose/missing piece) approaches loop but advances understanding. Propulsion solid, no major artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully; the final paragraph's shorter beats ("I knew I would never hang bells again... but I could bear the longing honestly, and that honesty was music") accelerate into closure. Minor loop: "silence" appears frequently across the piece without always adding new pressure—e.g., "glacial hush" and "soundless sanctuary" overlap semantically in early paragraphs. One paraphrase near the opening: "the silence was not empty; it smelled of stone and old cedar" restates the already-established sanctuary atmosphere without advancing it. No figurative muddle; metaphors are coherent. Overall propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, with most lines advancing investigation or stakes. However, several constructions loop conceptually: "architecture of lies" / "beams and bolts of the deception" / "scaffolding behind their own prayers" recycle the structural metaphor without added pressure. Template cadence appears in paired noun phrases: "serene in posture yet carrying upheaval," "objects pulled from muck…fingerprints of the stories." The final third avoids these patterns and propels cleanly to closure. Minor filter-verb stacking in reflective beats ("began to understand," "began to salvage") slightly dulls immediacy but remains voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high across most beats. The opening ("Snow sifted over the golden dock while fog rolled…") anchors voice and atmosphere efficiently. Minor scaffold appears: "infinitely patient" is repeated verbatim twice, and "oceanic hush" recurs without added pressure. The phrase "coaxing meaning from each hitch and loop by tracing shadows that the knots threw onto snow" is vivid but slightly overwritten for a mid-pressure beat. The final third compresses the clerk's reversal and the weavers' admission into summary-adjacent phrasing ("the clerk, shaken by recognition, watched…") that loses scene texture. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs, and no filter-verb stacks; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high—nearly every sentence in the garden scene carries metaphor ("shadows swallowing," "palace itself tighten," "ribs were a railing")—without pattern-teaching or payoff that differentiates peak beats from setup. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "I opened my notebook and described… Then I asked her to speak… She said he used to kneel… I tied the carpet thread…" creates a rhythmic flatness. Two instances of paraphrase loop: the notion of "explained absence" recurs in minor variations without added pressure, and "lonesome splendor" is declared then illustrated redundantly. Information density is strong in the opening, but the projection beat summarizes ("I let her borrowed breath cross it until the air beside us took on his height") rather than showing the mechanics in action.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lyric and richly textured, with strong figurative density ("chandelier," "uncalibrated spring," "stutter in the song"). However, overwriting accumulates: nearly every sentence in the opening and climax carries metaphor, creating a decorative wash that occasionally obscures propulsion. Paraphrase loop example: "trembled in him like an uncalibrated spring" followed by "quaking reverie" restates emotional state without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" structures. Clarity at closure remains intact—the pigment release and palace creak are legible—so deductions stay moderate. No filter-verb stacks or major artifacts in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and most lines advance story or character, but several artifacts lower the score. Paraphrase loop: "I dragged the boy out, then went back, because compassion is not a feeling that waits for permission" → "In the back room I found the sister…and as flames chewed the doorway I braced the beam" restates the rescue stakes without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "I [verb]" in the rescue sequence without purposeful effect. Stock metaphor: "flames chewed the doorway" and "kelp drifted in lazy ribbons" are serviceable but not fresh. The final paragraph's "we answer burning with saving" and "even the worst family fire can be grafted into light" edge toward thematic summary rather than image. Information density is generally high, and spatial choreography tracks, but scaffold phrases ("Later at the burn unit," "The next morning") compress key transitions flatly. These issues cluster but do not obscure closure; capping at mid-6s per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and often dense ("where dry basins held only chalky moons"), but several beats exhibit template cadence and figurative stacking without earned payoff: "an illness that blurred everything," "water remembered, not flowing but rehearsing," and the extended opening sentence runs through multiple clauses in a single breath. The constellation-match beat ("her realistically imaginative mind saw how a mechanic might have used sky patterns") tells rather than shows the causal insight. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the overwriting in high-pressure moments (latch scene, final light-carrying image) lowers information density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose carries high information density and vivid sensory specificity: "gliding moth," "grooves that glimmered without heat," "moonlit water." Sentence rhythm modulates effectively, and no major grammar or continuity breaks appear. However, three distinct artifact types lower the score: (a) mild paraphrase loop—"generational patterns were stitched into the place: starvines coiled as their ancestors had, and even the drifting spores pulsed in cycles" restates the concept across adjacent clauses; (b) the timeframe phrase "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" appears three times, the final use reading template-like rather than organically repurposed; (c) filter-verb stack in one passage ("believed," "felt," "recognized") dulls immediacy. Artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce propulsion in non-closure beats. Apply cumulative artifact penalty ~−0.8 and disallow 9+ globally per the filter-verb-stack rule.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short beats at the spirit encounter, longer reflection on family dinners), and imagery is often precise ("orange wings drifted over the glass like embers"). Information density is high in middle beats—ribbons, rubbings, poem fragments layer quickly. However, several lines loop conceptually: "fiercely meditative" appears three times, "thundering calm" twice, both as decorative markers rather than evolving constructs. "The spirit taught him to read the cemetery like a field" and "guiding his hand to tie the matching ribbon" edge toward summary where dramatization would tighten. Pronoun clarity and spatial choreography hold; no grammar breaks. Metaphor ("butterflies...like embers," "weight made the fabric tremble") stays coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing images anchor and recharge. Information density is high: most sentences do multi-job work (bob's history + storm damage + jury chain in one move). Minor loop artifacts: "she heard more than silence; she heard the widow's words, the surf gnawing the ridge, and her own shame" reprises structure within a single beat; "The widow did not smile, yet she nodded once, and Mara accepted that absolution would remain incremental" stacks clauses that could tighten. No figurative muddle in peak beats. One small template-cadence run in the middle third (repeated "she" + past-tense verb openers across three consecutive sentences) slightly dulls momentum but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the cipher-decoding beat. Clear propulsion in the silo investigation. However, paraphrase loops appear: "tenderly organized" recurs three times without reweighting, and "uncharted echoes" is restated as "faint click…intake of breath" without added pressure. Template cadence in the opening third: "They call me…Tonight my tools…The widow Alvera…" runs four consecutive subject-verb stems. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully across the piece, with longer expository sentences in setup and compressed action at the writing moment. Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances character, world, or stakes. Minor scaffold appears: "turning absences into variables and feeding them into a slate of equations" slightly paraphrases "run predictive modeling on her own maps of ignorance." The phrase "she answered with grounded imagination, explaining" uses a near-abstraction where dramatized dialogue would sharpen the beat. Figurative language ("ink had not yet met paper," "bones warmed in her pocket," "small machine of meaning") is purposeful but occasionally stacks without payoff. No loops or text artifacts touch the closure beat. Sentence openings vary adequately, and paragraph structure creates visual rhythm. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("dust drifted like snow," "dial glow warmed the fog," "fish under ice"), yet several beats loop or paraphrase: "secretly luminous" appears three times across the story, and the "dust" motif is restated in adjacent sentences without added pressure ("dust on the stands wanted to listen" / "dust to speak" / "dust at their boots shimmered"). Template cadence runs appear: "Mara opened…began to copy," "She noticed…she understood," "Mara decided…and she sewed." The final third stacks passive constructions ("was on the air again," "were directions") that dull immediacy. Information density is high, but scaffold remains visible in transitions like "At home, Mara stitched" and "To test her trick, she returned."

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high, and figurative language (night sky of charcoal, mask chime, mirage) is purposeful. However, several sentences loop or restate: "safety was always a mirage, shimmering until you stepped on it" is then echoed by "safety was still a mirage" at the end without added pressure. The phrase "weaves truth carefully by drawing what grief allowed and leaving the rest in deliberate blur" uses present tense amid past-tense narration without clear effect. Template stems appear in the middle third ("She [verb]… She [verb]…"). The closure sentence is dense but syntactically tangled, slowing propulsion at a key moment. Clarity holds, but momentum dips in the reflective middle passages.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance setting, character, or theme (e.g., "fish swam through windows" anchors the drowned library and primes the excavation). Rhythm varies purposefully, and the auger sequence builds propulsion through physical detail. Two line-level issues: minor paraphrase loop in the opening ("plague had ended…sea finally stopped coughing bodies" restates cessation without added pressure), and the phrase "rationally rebellious" appears as a label without immediate embodied consequence in that beat. Overall clarity and concision are strong, with no major scaffolding or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (most lines do double work: world-building + character or theme + image). However, several long sentences—especially the opening and Mara's reflection on her father—approach syntactic overload, stacking clauses without clear propulsion and risking reader fatigue. The phrase "the vanishing arts were quieter casualties, erased not by flames but by memos that arrived like dust on shelves" is vivid but stretches the metaphor chain (flames/memos/dust) without anchoring in concrete action. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt expectantly resigned," "seemed to sing along") dulls immediacy in high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffold detected, and the final image (silence as verdict) propels cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and the prose advances story and atmosphere efficiently. Sentence variety supports rhythm and several vivid anchors land ("three moons lined up like coins on black velvet," "the taste of regret and diagrams"). However, runs of identical syntactic stems appear: "Each morning she pruned… each cut felt," "she cut away… she kept," "a woman remembered… a boy remembered… a clerk remembered." Template cadence across three consecutive lines in the final third triggers −0.5. Minor scaffold ("the botanist's stew had tasted of regret and diagrams, and in the aftertaste Mira understood") pads causality. Stock metaphor "small, luminous garden" at closure dulls precision. Proofreading is clean; no loops or pronoun drift. The accumulation of patterns across peak beats caps high-band entry at 8.7 per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., "thunder nets hung like veils" conveys both setting and tone). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The metaphor "eyes flat as coins" is vivid; "brittle code" is apt. Minor: "wonder is a hungry thing" and "truth…can make honey of thunder" edge toward elevated diction in final beats but remain voice-consistent. The lacquer-box sequence is clear and propulsive. Grammar and tense are clean. Zero scaffolding or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; imagery is dense and purposeful ("faint drag of meaning," "wall-scar that fit its frame"). Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor issues: a few near-paraphrases ("aliveness was not magic but attention, and attention could be stolen by careless hands" restates the theme slightly) and the phrase "she finally understood" slightly scaffolds the realization. The orris-shard beats are vivid and propulsive. No loops that obscure causality; clarity remains high. The prose sustains the hushed-blaze tone without overwriting, though figurative density is consistently high—acceptable here because the pattern is taught and supports the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance discovery, setting, or internal recalibration. The opening anchors voice and stakes; the final line ("Tell them the whole seam") recharges the threading motif. However, a few phrases edge toward overwriting: "dripping weeds like hair," "algae fronds holding still like curtains," and "violet liquid spiraled out...arranging itself into letters" stack figurative language in adjacent lines without escalating pressure. The cascade structure risks template cadence ("A fourth revelation followed, cascading without pause"), though it remains legible. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high: most lines advance character, image, or concept. No paraphrase loops detected, though a few phrases approach scaffolding ("I told myself," "I realized"). Figurative language is controlled—"the texture of the missed opportunity softened into something I could carry"—and suits the philosophical tone. One minor overwrite: "boundless confinement made architecture" is vivid but slightly showy. Clarity and propulsion are strong; the final paragraph breathes without losing momentum. Grammar and tense are consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high in most beats (moon-tipped brush carries backstory and present function, greenhouse setting supplies multiple pressures), but the piece suffers from template cadence ("she was," "he was," "they would") and synonym loops ("methodically hopeful" appears twice without reweighting, "rouse/roused" recurs three times in close proximity). The phrase "as if" appears four times in under 800 words, flattening immediacy. The closure paragraph lists consequences ("passersby paused," "some returned," "gifts land") in summary fashion rather than dramatizing one beat with specificity. No paraphrase loops touch the final image directly, so artifact penalties remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and many lines do double work, but several paraphrase loops appear: "the arts were dying here, not with applause but with mold" restates what the mildew and dread already showed; "rosewater from the crust rose with the cold mist" is near-synonym churn. Template cadence runs in the thaw sequence ("Maris mixed…shaped…baked…stacked"). The opening sentence is dense and atmospheric, but mid-story beats accumulate figurative language without clear payoff ("light meant discovery" is abstract, not embodied). No severe artifacts touch the closure image, but cumulative minor loops and scaffold reduce propulsion. Deduction: −0.6 for paraphrase and template stems, −0.3 for register drift in non-closure beats = total −0.9.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (most lines do multiple jobs). Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Final line recharges "initiate" and "design" motifs with new weight. Figurative language is vivid and coherent ("teeth of stone," "appetite," "breathing" seam of light). Minor deductions: "counter clockwise clock maker, neatly inventive with brass and grief" is slightly ornamental in the opening and "bleak exhilaration" is repeated verbatim from the first paragraph. Template cadence risk: "He placed... threaded... and waited" in one long sentence could tighten. Overall propulsion is strong, no major loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, creating atmospheric texture but occasionally blurring propulsion: "footsteps pulled squeals," "mirrors…breathed," "luminance…gathered into a bead," "fear pry at my ribs." In the climactic booth sequence, metaphor stacks without clear causal linkage—"be unseen by being perfectly seen" and "swan's twisted neck…bit skin" occur in rapid succession with minimal concrete grounding. Minor loops: "lingering luminance" appears four times in similar phrasing. Sentence openings vary well, and no major grammatical errors. The overwriting does not fully obscure closure but dulls immediacy at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance action or setting. Several template-cadence runs appear: "From a cracked storage chest he drew... he held it up... With the mallet he tapped... then sketched..." and "He let the danger join... shouting... and the crew caught it... then used it..." (−0.5 for template runs across multiple beats). Stock metaphor: "the sea still held the day in its throat" is evocative but not character-particular. Register drift: "fractal generating a score" and "restless euphony" import technical/academic diction without clear POV grounding (−0.3). Paraphrase loop: the final paragraph summarizes the closure insight ("his calling was not to predict disaster but to translate it into music") immediately after dramatizing it through action (−0.2). Total artifact deductions: −1.0. Propulsion is strong in the storm sequence; clarity is mostly maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense; most sentences advance setting, character, or discovery. Minor pattern issues: "quietly driven" repeats verbatim across two paragraphs without transformation (opening and late middle), and "the watchers" recurs frequently in similar syntactic slots. Figurative language (gate as mouth, rust as reef) is coherent and purposeful. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and reconfigure the horizon image effectively. Clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clean with strong images ("ivy overgrown...like graves with green hair," "weeds rose...like slow smoke"). Minor scaffold: "She was a historian...fictional on paper yet stubbornly real in her own routines and debts" reads as exposition mid-opening; the "fictional" claim is never paid off and distracts. "Emotionally rational even when anger tightened her throat" tells rather than showing contradictory impulses in action. Sentence rhythm varies well. No loops or template cadence. Information density is high; most lines advance character or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and the prose carries high information density with strong verbs ("wrests," "threads," "wedges"). However, several lines exhibit template cadence and elevated register that flatten momentum: "stoically sensitive to every creak," "the missing is threaded with what remains and cannot be pulled free," and "a hushed blaze across silted tiles" stack figurative language without on-page payoff in choices. Paraphrase loop appears when "interlaced absence" is defined in one sentence, then restated in the next. Minor spatial clarity issue: "threading the skiff through the opening into the submerged pavilion" then "below the surface" creates slight redundancy. The opening and closing lines are strong, and no grammatical errors appear, but the cumulative register drift and phrase density in mid-passage reduce propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clarity and propulsion are strong; information density is high ("Each drawer was numbered, yet the order made no sense, as if someone had panicked and rearranged history"). Sentence variety supports rhythm. Minor template cadence in paired moves: "I readjusted my gloves, steadied my breathing" and "I sat...and let the darkness settle" recur as parallel constructions. A few filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") in mid-pressure beats slightly dull immediacy. No loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances setting, craft detail, or plot (gem polishing, lantern mechanics, basilica architecture). However, several lines loop conceptually: "dead on the shelf, because her hands cannot remember the weight of his laughter" and "empty wings" both gesture at the same lack without added pressure. The phrase "luminous torment" appears twice (once in recorded whispers, once in the final lanterns), which is intentional recurrence but edges toward stock metaphor. Minor filter-verb stack in the opening third: "she tries," "she has spent," "she chooses," "she sets," "she transforms"—five proximate stems that flatten propulsion. The climax compresses action economically ("she steps into the projection, letting the dream record her back") but "takes the paper part, folds it quickly" elides the mechanics of how flame and paper separate, requiring inference. Clarity holds, momentum is sound, but the piece would benefit from cutting one or two synonym gestures (e.g., "empty wings" after "dead on the shelf") and varying the subject-verb openings in the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances the technical hunt or deepens the backstory's pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives during thruster burns, longer spirals during reflection). Yet the prose carries minor overwriting: "graduate ruins" is a strained metaphor, and some phrasing loops conceptually ("unused potential… the pauses between triggers… the same slack in reality") without adding new detail. The closure sentence is clear but slightly abstract ("forcing every future drone to feel that pause as mercy"), missing the concrete image that would crystallize cost. No major artifacts, but figurative density occasionally blurs immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose carries momentum through the search sequence. Information density is high: most lines advance plot (drone launch, star trails, notch discovery) or atmosphere (stones drinking light, dust exhaling). Two minor loops: "perpetually surprised" appears twice; "missing pieces" recurs in adjacent beats without reweighting. Template cadence appears in paired participial openers and repeated "she [verb]" stems across the middle third. A handful of stock metaphors ("ink poured onto paper," "shy comet") and elevated diction ("brilliant dimness," "exhaling dust") in high-pressure beats nudge toward overwriting. Overall clarity and propulsion remain strong; no major scaffold or syntax errors.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("guilt-ridden," "sieved hush," "shake truth through a mesh"). Information density is high; sentences layer backstory, motive, and world. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "the weight of a withheld truth" / "the weight of unspoken words" / "the weight of the withheld truth lifting"; "promised herself she would quell" echoes the prompt's "Action: quell" too closely. Template stems recur: "She realized…" / "She explained…" / "Mara watched…" The final paragraph summarizes the shift ("quiet that was no longer sieved but shared") rather than dramatizing it through gesture or image.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies well ("Boots scraped behind her" / "Across the mist, Ridge soldiers emerged"), and information density is high—most lines advance character, image, or pressure. Figurative language is controlled: "stones narrowed to a knife edge," "lanterns smudged halos," brass "complaining in a tiny squeal." Minor deductions: slight template cadence in the reflection block ("Living in that gap… was what had taught her to listen…" followed by "She told herself she worked exchanges to recycle…"), and one near-paraphrase loop (wire "pretended to be efficient" / "not by his order, but the prisoner flinched"). Artifacts do not touch closure; apply −0.6 for two distinct loops in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character or stake. However, a paraphrase loop appears: "backlash of regrets" is restated across paragraphs four and fourteen without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence: "He [verb]" stems recur in four consecutive sentences mid-story (−0.4). Stock metaphor "salt in a cut" and "thin strand of faith" slightly soften precision (−0.3 cumulative). The opening and closing images (cracked smile / wet pencils gleaming) are vivid and propulsive. Syntax varies; no major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.6)
    Information density is high ("clinic room with my file wiped clean and my heart wiped cleaner"), and rhythm varies purposefully across beats. However, synonym churn and paraphrase loops appear: "clean slate seeker with a dirty past" echoes "wiped clean/cleaner," and "delicately robust...thin as old skin yet refusing to crack" restates fragility twice. Template stems recur ("I realized," "I wanted to believe," "I tossed") without taught pattern. Figurative density peaks in the lake scene ("water itself was thinking," "lake shimmered like a jury") without muddling clarity, but the final line's "word by word" moralizes rather than charging the image. Apply paraphrase-loop and stem penalties: −0.6 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (each line advances character state or plot). However, several paraphrase loops and figurative stacks blunt momentum: "paradoxically steady" appears twice (opening and final beat), "the way the moon looks calm while it tugs oceans" and "her pulse remains paradoxically steady, keeping time for Sable as if it were a leash" restate the same metaphor, and "reluctantly, toward the moon" / "reluctant metamorphosis finishes" recycles the reluctance label. Stock phrases ("phoenix bonfire," "oldest tree," "permanent moonlight") repeat without reweighting. The closure image is vivid ("two hounds circle once, then run among the blossoms") and free of artifact, limiting deduction per the closure-priority rule.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative density is high but mostly controlled: "fist clenched like a seed," "crack that split like a river delta," "vapor braided into bark," "pouches that pulsed like lungs." The final third maintains clarity. One deduction for mild overwriting in the glade passage where "the beauty choked me the way milk chokes a tired throat, sweet and urgent and impossible to spit out" stacks modifiers without added pressure. A few lines approach paraphrase ("I understood that to reclaim the lost hours I had to relive them without trying to escape, so I asked the tree to return them slowly, and I stayed willingly perplexed") but the reprise of "willingly perplexed" is purposeful. Information density is strong; no scaffold or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do double duty (e.g., "the ship grows still, as if all recycled metal is holding its breath" conveys atmosphere and marks the beat). Opening and closing images are strong. However, patterned artifacts accumulate: repeated "and" constructions in the first half, filter-verb stacks in reflective passages, and minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "the dimension's lock slides open" after "the hatch vibrates…from recognition"). The climax beats are clean, so non-closure accumulation caps the deduction at −0.8. The phrase "ghostly resolve in her posture" in paragraph 7 reads as mild overwriting for internal narration.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the figurative language (e.g., "fine ash sifted from the ceiling like gray pollen") remains legible. Two artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops in paragraphs 5–6 ("She left each of them something she could not afford" immediately followed by "each time her empty pockets grew lighter, fate grew heavier") and template-cadence runs in the prophecy paragraph ("had read," "had meant," "had not come," "had brought"). The final beat summary ("they began gathering stranded villagers") replaces scene with scaffold, dulling closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentence openings repeat stems excessively: "The coded angles," "The holder was," "The shadow," "I carried," "I set," "I rotated," "I tipped," "I returned"—template cadence across the terrace sequence (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear: "the Cradle of Sparks" is named, then "that secret cache the Cradle of Sparks," restating within two lines (−0.2). Filter-verb stacks ("I listened," "I took," "I carried," "I set," "I rotated," "I tipped") in the high-pressure middle third dull immediacy (−0.5). Information density is high in world-building but lower in action beats, where intricate setup yields mechanical payoff. Clarity is solid; no grammar breaks, but propulsion sags under declarative scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Clarity is strong, with clean grammar and no pronoun confusion. Two significant issues lower the score: (1) repetitive syntax in the middle third—multiple sentences open with "The" or "When" followed by noun-clause constructions—and (2) a few stretched metaphors ("borrowed dawn that never quite became day" recurs but its vehicle remains vague). The final image is vivid and propulsive, but the prior beats carry mild scaffold phrasing ("weeks of borrowed dawn passed like one long inhale").

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; high-density lines often do multiple jobs ("She led me past the telescope to the darkroom where plates were developed, and set the timer on the counter like a small altar"). Figurative language is coherent and voice-driven (storm as weather the mountain floats above, star as "wound that refused to close"). Minor overwriting in mid-section: "rarefying the hours into clean slices" and "scrubbed raw" sky cluster metaphors without fresh pressure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one template-cadence risk in parallel explanatory clauses. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the final image ("carried the plates like fragile oaths") recharges prior material without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is dense and syntactically ambitious, with high information load per sentence. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("brass ribs," "marrow of an argument," "baton signaling the overture"). However, the piece suffers from template cadence: multiple sentences open with participial phrases or subordinate clauses in similar rhythm, creating a drumbeat effect. The opening paragraph is a single 60+ word sentence that buries the lead, and "dignified chaos filled the atrium" is a stock construction. Paraphrase loops appear: "kept his eyes on the sundial" and "letting Veller drive him in arcs that mirrored the coded angles" restate the same tactic without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("pockets full of ash," "sirens braid with birdsong"), but multiple metaphors in high-pressure beats (riots, near-burning) create rhythmic drag rather than propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "forge beauty from anarchy" is restated as "fracture could shine, if you let it bloom." Template cadence in the middle section ("He broke into… he set… he imagined… he began") stacks identical stems without taught pattern. Information density is high, but the piece reads as lyrically overwritten for the modest on-page stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and carries atmospheric charge; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high in the hidden-room sequence and closure beats. Some scaffold and near-paraphrase appear: "the trap and the gift at once" restates what the prior sentence implied; "understood the compasses better than the engineers did, not by equations but by rhythm" and "his mind was strategically creative in the way it searched for patterns" are adjacent synonym loops. Figurative density is high in the opening third ("creaked like a ship," "root-bridges rising and sinking," "violet") without always advancing pressure. No major clarity breaks, but pervasive lyricism in early beats slows propulsion slightly. Proofreading is clean; no tense or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically rich, but density issues emerge. The opening sentence runs long with stacked subordinate clauses ("Before the monsoon arrived, the ancient ridge in bloom glowed above Lanu Island like a spilled lantern, and the air tasted of salt and unspoken names"), and several beats paraphrase the same idea: the Council's fear of memory loss is stated, then restated via "stories slid away each season," then again as "the coming rains would wash the rest clean." The line "when many people dreamed the same image, the next day the ridge bloomed in the same colors" is followed by a near-duplicate move in the next paragraph. These loops dull momentum in the middle third, triggering a −0.6 deduction for paraphrase and synonym churn (Q7 patterned-artifact penalty). The closure image is clear, so the impact is confined to the mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high in the sensory passages (kelp, wet basalt, rain pearls). However, multiple beats carry figurative density that slows momentum: "the sky was washed into cerulean regret," "the sea rocked in and out like a lullaby," "older than wood, like a story retold until only the regret remained." These metaphors are vivid but cluster without pattern-teaching, creating textural drag (−0.5). Minor paraphrase loop: "the compass was hungry for memory" and "the tides of remembrance would keep lifting what I had buried" restate the same idea across adjacent lines (−0.2). The final paragraph's "deepening cerulean that was not forgiveness yet, but was the beginning" lands cleanly, but the preceding beats' ornamental quality lowers propulsion.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence does multiple jobs (character, setting, theme) with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and grounded (“humidity curled the torn leaves as if each plant was exhaling a small apology”; “storm had not smashed everything at once but had worried it down”). There are no evident loops, mixed metaphors, or register slips; technical terms are sparse and precise. The final sentences land cleanly, recharging earlier motifs without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but precise, with most sentences doing double duty for image and theme without lapsing into muddled or mixed metaphors. There’s no evident scaffold, repetition loop, or filter-verb stacking; each paragraph advances either the investigation, emotional stakes, or atmospheric patterning. Figurative language stays coherent with the established lexicon of glass, light, sound, and frost, and the final lines efficiently echo prior motifs. Any risk of overwriting is mitigated by consistent control and clarity at the key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense with information and image but remain clear, and most do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, emotion, and motion together). Figurative language is original and coherent (“frost flowers,” “winterglass,” “the bench under him trembled like thunder once did”) without stacking into purple excess. There’s little evident scaffolding or repetition; momentum is well-maintained despite the meditative tone. A handful of lines verge on abstraction, but they don’t obscure cause/effect or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and nearly every image does multiple jobs for mood, worldbuilding, and theme. Figurative language is rich but largely coherent and legible; phrases like “chased stillness” and “shelves drift in slow spirals” accumulate into a unified texture rather than purple fog. There is some risk of saturation—most sentences carry a metaphor—which occasionally edges toward overrichness but never fully obscures causality or closure. Syntax varies enough to maintain momentum, and the final cadence is clear and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is economical yet rich, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (“sanctions had made dignity another rationed item” is a good example of compressed insight). Rhythm varies naturally, and there is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; almost every line advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and the recurring bell motif is handled cleanly. There are no noticeable grammatical slips or clarity issues, and the final image lands with clean, charged simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is lush, musical, and information-dense; most sentences do double or triple duty for setting, emotion, and theme (“her chest had felt like an unopened letter” is emblematic). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and non-redundant, with no major loops or scaffold phrases dragging momentum. There is a mild risk of over-saturation—nearly every line carries an image—but clarity and propulsion to closure remain intact. The final images (tear as lantern, fog clearing with each exhale) land cleanly without metaphor muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but purposeful: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Metaphors are striking and, crucially, coherent with the story’s logic (time as texture, bark, growth rings; the river as pages turning). There is a sustained high level of figurative language that occasionally risks saturation, yet clarity of action and causality remains intact. Line-by-line, this is polished enough for top-tier venues, needing at most micro-trims for breath and contrast rather than structural repair.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is high: there are no visible loops, scaffolding, or muddled metaphors, and almost every sentence does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, and motion). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, and syntax varies enough to sustain momentum. A few lines (“her staggering grace becomes a plan for everyone”) brush the edge of abstraction, but they are grounded by the concrete image of seeds spilling into hands. Overall clarity, rhythm, and density are publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, theme) and maintain clarity despite dense imagery. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern-consistent (memory, absences, sound/color), avoiding mixed metaphors or muddle. There’s very little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each paragraph tends to add new pressure or nuance. Minor abstract phrases exist, but they’re firmly grounded in preceding concrete images, so momentum and readability hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are mostly efficient even when ornate, and many carry layered work (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). Metaphors (“dipped in green fire,” “bottled sea”) are vivid and rarely strain, with no serious muddle around the climax. There is a mild tendency toward density—nearly every sentence is figurative—which occasionally flirts with purple prose and could be dialed back for contrast and punch. Nonetheless, clarity holds throughout, and the final image is clean rather than overworked.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is precise, vivid, and economical; most sentences perform multiple functions (image, character, and theme) without redundancy. Metaphors (ribs around an empty heart, thawing heart, pages of glass) are coherent and sustained rather than piled on. Rhythm varies nicely between long, flowing sentences and shorter, weighted lines, supporting the emotional curve. A few formulations edge toward thematic statement, but they remain grounded enough not to feel like scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and information; figurative language is vivid and rarely redundant. Images are coherent and thematically apt, tying film, props, and bodies into one visual vocabulary. Syntax varies enough to keep rhythm lively, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding phrases. A few abstractions (“transformative,” “products”) skim close to thematic label, but they don’t materially blunt the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: images are striking yet controlled (“stillness that sealed sound like resin seals a dead insect”), and most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). Figurative density is high but pattern-driven (coast, silence, mapping, memory) rather than scattershot, so momentum rarely stalls. There are no notable loops, scaffolding phrases, or mixed metaphors, and the final paragraph lands cleanly without purple excess. The lushness edges toward saturation in spots, which might test some editors’ tolerance but doesn’t significantly obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is tight, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty with image and concept, and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (“dust motes in sunlight,” “thin line of light, ordinary to the ear yet sharp enough to cut time”) without tipping into purple excess. The only slight ding is the near-aphoristic clarity of the maintenance message, which risks feeling a bit “explained” compared to the otherwise implicit texture, though it remains in-world. Line-level craft comfortably supports publication-level momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty (atmosphere plus character or plot) and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; images like the “reflection broke into two ghostly images that could not hide from each other” are both clear and thematically pointed. Rhythm varies well at paragraph and sentence level, maintaining momentum despite a reflective tilt. I see no significant loops, muddled metaphors, or copy errors that would dull the closure image or confuse causality.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is notably strong: dense yet precise sentences, no evident scaffolding or synonym loops, and figurative language that stays coherent and purposeful. Many lines multitask—advancing setting, character, and theme simultaneously (e.g., the marbles polished until “their fractures caught the sun like spider silk”). Syntax varies enough to keep momentum, and the paragraphing supports conceptual turns. I see no grammatical slips or muddled images that obscure the closure beat or its emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but purposeful, often doing double duty for atmosphere and concept, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors are generally clean and thematically apt, and the prose avoids both syntactic monotony and over-cluttered ornament. Information order is clear, with cause-and-effect and spatial relations consistently legible even in concept-heavy passages. A few figurative flourishes brush against purple but do not impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, plot) with minimal scaffolding, and there is little to no synonym churn or paraphrase looping. Figurative language—“false applause,” “taking the river into its ribs,” stains as “tiny maps”—is inventive and generally coherent with the world’s logic. The rhythm varies effectively, using long sinuous sentences to build atmosphere and shorter clauses to punctuate key actions (taps, drips, the door easing inward). Occasionally the density of metaphor edges toward purple, but it doesn’t materially slow momentum or blur causality.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense yet precise, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and information—images like “letting errors pass through her like wind through spruce” and “the graphite became fog” are fresh and legible. Figurative language is thematically coherent (weather, measurement, light) rather than scattershot, and syntax varies to manage rhythm without resorting to drumbeat patterns. There’s little scaffolding or repetition; paragraphs move the emotional and conceptual line forward. Despite the high lyricism, cause and effect remain clear at closure, and no metaphors collapse into muddle or self-contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is highly polished: sentences pull multiple weights at once (setting, character, theme) with minimal redundancy, and line-level rhythm is varied and intentional. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and precise, and there are no paraphrase loops or structural scaffolds dulling momentum. Syntax remains clear even through longer, clause-rich constructions, so causality and spatial relations are never obscured. The only restraint on a higher score is a mild tendency toward unrelenting metaphorical density, which occasionally edges toward ornament rather than pure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but generally do double or triple duty in advancing atmosphere, character, and theme. Figurative language is rich yet controlled; images like “paper softened into loam” and “the chamber absorbed them like ash” are clear and apt rather than purple or muddled. There’s little to no scaffolding, synonym loops, or mechanical cadence, and the prose flows with good rhythm, especially in transitions between library and refuge. Occasionally, abstraction stacks (“regenerative silence,” “flood of history”) come close to conceptual heaviness, but they remain grounded enough in the surrounding specifics to preserve momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; many sentences pull double duty on character, theme, and atmosphere. Figurative language is generally fresh and controlled (“pines whispered like low strings”), and momentum rarely stalls. There is some mild tendency toward thematic restatement in the last lines and a high density of metaphor in places, but it stops short of purple prose. No significant loops, scaffolding, or clarity issues interfere with closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level work is elegant and dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and thematic cueing) without feeling crowded. Imagery is fresh and coherent—"bronze dust," "cedar and panic," "scaled shadows"—and metaphors stay within the established sensory and conceptual palette. There’s no noticeable scaffolding, synonym churn, or mixed metaphor; rhythm feels crafted rather than templated. The prose is rich, but because pressure is contemplative rather than kinetic, the density enhances rather than slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, character, and pressure) with minimal scaffolding, and metaphors are fresh and coherent. There’s very little redundancy or looped phrasing; the prose maintains forward motion even in denser expository patches. Figurative density is high but not purple, and it doesn’t obscure clarity in peak beats. Minor risk lies in occasional quasi-mottos (final sentence especially), yet they don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is dense but controlled: almost every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme without redundancy. Metaphors are fresh and internally consistent, and figurative density under pressure feels like purposeful pattern, not purple drift. There are no noticeable scaffold sentences or synonym loops, and the final lines land cleanly without overexplaining. Rhythm on the page supports the idea of loops and pauses, giving the prose a distinct musicality without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density—most lines do double duty for setting, theme, and character—and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“as if music had been stored in the curl and forgotten”; “the ice was a single sheet of dim glass”) is fresh and consistent with the world’s logic, and the rhythm of sentences reads well aloud. Momentum holds despite reflection because each reflective move feeds directly into the ritual and its stakes. The only caution is that nearly every sentence carries imagery, which may feel dense to some readers but does not obscure clarity here.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus psychology, or rule plus image) and little to no paraphrase looping. Figurative language is generally clean and non-redundant, and the recurring motifs (labyrinth, light, gravity, branching) are handled with variation rather than repetition. Syntax and paragraphing create a smooth flow through a conceptually complex premise. There are no noticeable artifacts or clotted metaphors that obscure causality or dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences pull multiple weights (worldbuilding, mood, and action), and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is rich but generally coherent (“vibrations skitter like startled mice”; “filament of hush”) and supports rather than obscures events. The prose occasionally edges toward density, with several metaphor-laden clauses in sequence, which risks slowing momentum in a high-pressure beat. Still, clarity holds throughout, and the final image lands cleanly without textual clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, information density is high, and images typically do more than one job (setting, mood, and character all at once). Figurative language is purposeful and seldom muddled; there are no obvious loops, scaffold phrases, or cadence templates that stall motion. The occasional stacked modifiers or slightly ornate turns (“a layered tranquility that tried to pass as safety”) flirt with purple but retain clarity and do not blur causality or the closure image. Overall momentum is well maintained for a lyric-leaning piece.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense and often do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and interiority in one), and there’s good rhythmic variation. The lushness occasionally skirts purple, but metaphors remain coherent and thematically aligned (crystal, light, ash, humidity) rather than mixed at random. There is minimal scaffolding or redundant explanation, and action and reflection are well-interleaved so momentum rarely stalls. The main constraint keeping this just below the very top band is a slight over-explicitness in a few thematic sentences where a more purely imagistic close might have been even sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are dense but purposeful, with minimal scaffolding or repetition, and metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (rope, layers, braiding, currents). The prose balances lyricism with clarity; despite frequent figurative language, cause-and-effect and spatial relations remain legible. Paragraphing marks conceptual shifts cleanly, and there are no notable cadence templates or synonym loops. This is publishable without substantive line edits.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double or triple duty (worldbuilding, mood, and character in “waves slap the shipwrecks, and gulls remember how to argue”), and figurative language is vivid without sliding into purple. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors; images like wrecks “as if they tried to flee together and sank holding hands” are precise and emotionally targeted. The prose sustains a high descriptive density yet maintains clarity and forward motion through the scene. A few lines verge on ornate, but the pattern is clearly intentional and supports the tone rather than bogging it down.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“paid to feel on behalf of others,” “coins slick with resin” as both world and boundary). Rhythm varies effectively between long, baroque lines and tighter, declarative beats at key turns (“I could have sold him a bright counterfeit absolution, but the grotto demanded honesty”). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned; mixed metaphors are avoided and key actions remain clear. The only constraint on an even higher score is that the metaphor density occasionally verges on ornate, which might distract some readers at a prestigious line-focused venue.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and images that usually pull double duty for setting and theme (“as if the sea had learned to whisper words”). Information density is high without confusion, and there are few to no paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences. A handful of metaphors could verge on prettiness in less skilled hands, but here they remain coherent and purposeful. Line-level control is strong and publication-ready, though not formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and musical, with high information density: most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and emotional tone. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically unified (crystal, wounds, webs, water/light), rarely tipping into muddle or redundancy. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and there are no obvious scaffold sentences, paraphrase loops, or technical errors that drag momentum. The main limitation is a near-uniform lyric register that very slightly blunts dynamic contrast in higher-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense and efficient: most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and character, and images like “a silver ribbon laid on stone” or “a flock of birds turning at once” are vivid without stacking into muddle. Rhythm varies well between long, image-rich sentences and tighter action lines in the descent. There are no obvious paraphrase loops or mechanical cadence patterns; figurative language remains coherent and thematically linked to sound and motion. A slight tendency toward consistent lyric richness in high-pressure beats keeps this a hair under the 9+ range but does not impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, dense, and purposeful; most sentences pull double duty for image and character, and there is very little scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are coherent within an established matrix (math, seeds, patterns, light) and rarely clash or over-accumulate enough to blur sense. Pacing stays nimble despite lyricism, and the closure image (“buried optimism like a lantern under her coat”) is both clear and charged. A few moments flirt with ornamental richness—where nearly every clause carries a metaphor—but they do not obscure causality or the emotional throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense yet efficient, and figurative language is consistently apt and concrete (“the sound had run up the walls like a scent”). There are no noticeable scaffold sentences or paraphrase loops; almost every line either advances the situation or deepens atmosphere and character. The imagery flirts with lushness but stops short of purple prose, remaining legible even in peak moments. Minor trims could further heighten propulsion, but nothing here obscures cause/effect or dulls the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and free of scaffold or synonym loops. Metaphors (“bark taking rain,” the trellis groaning like a ship) are vivid yet controlled, with no mixed or strained imagery. Nearly every line does at least two jobs—advancing plot, deepening character, and thickening atmosphere simultaneously. The final paragraphs in particular have excellent rhythmic control, allowing a quiet yet charged landing.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and rarely redundant, and images are precise rather than generic. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled (“sky looked like a bruise that would not heal,” “salt in my lungs”) and tied to character perception. The prose carries momentum despite its richness; nearly every sentence does double duty for mood and story. A few moments edge toward purple, but they don’t blur logic or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, dense with information, and often do double duty for atmosphere and concept without lapsing into muddled metaphor. Images like “a map that redrew itself whenever he trusted it” or “laughter swallowed in midnight” feel precise rather than generic, and there’s little to no visible scaffolding or synonym churn. Despite sustained figurative language, clarity of action and causality remains intact, including at the possession and release beats. A few abstractions (“unseen forces,” “everyday magic”) are repeated more as thematic tags than as freshly embodied moments, just keeping it shy of the topmost band.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, theme, and motion) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy, and the piece passes a read-aloud rhythm test. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and coherent, with no mixed metaphors that blur sense. There are no noticeable template cadences, filter-verb piles, or momentum-stalling loops; the prose remains clear despite its density. The only limit to pushing into the very highest band is that a few abstractions (“meaning assembled slowly”) carry weight that might land even harder if more tightly tied to situated bodily or sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information, e.g., “the moment when smokers crushed their last cigarette and insomniacs tried prayer.” Syntax is mostly clean and propulsive; there are no significant loops or scaffold phrases, and causality remains clear despite the lyricism. At times metaphor density (constellations as route markers, cracks as arrows, star-dust on shoes) approaches saturation and risks feeling slightly over-designed. A small pruning of the most decorative comparisons would tighten momentum without harming atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and images that usually do more than one job (e.g., music as both metaphor for memory and structural motif). The prose leans lyrical but stops short of purple; metaphors like “as if turning pages” and “music stores breath” are coherent and thematically aligned. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the final lines land cleanly without over-explaining. A few sentences pack multiple figurative layers where a slight simplification might sharpen impact, but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: most metaphors (“doors opened onto rooms that did not exist a breath before,” “mutiny gathered like a council”) align cleanly with the story’s conceptual frame and avoid mixed or strained imagery. Sentences tend to multitask—advancing plot while nuancing atmosphere or character—without evident padding or synonym loops. Rhythm modulates well from broader atmospheric openings to tighter, sharper lines around the final decision. A very slight risk of “purple” remains, but it never obscures sense or dulls the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is excellent: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (setting, character, theme) without bloat, and metaphors (“drain gurgle like a throat clearing itself”) are fresh and coherent. There are no visible loops, scaffold sentences, or clotted figurative runs that slow momentum, and syntax varies smoothly. The final image with Mercy beside the woman’s folded hands is clean, charged, and un-muddied by overwriting. Minor phrases edge toward thematic explicitness rather than pure image, which is the only thing holding this under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is excellent: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and sentences that usually do at least two jobs (image plus theme, or action plus interiority). Figurative language is frequent but disciplined, with very few mixed or strained metaphors; repetitions (the lamp method phrasing) are purposeful and pattern-building, not accidental. There’s essentially no synonym churn or paraphrase loops, and the final sentence neatly recharges earlier motifs without over-explanation. It just avoids the sense of absolute inevitability and surprise in rhythm that would push this into the very topmost band.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, character) with few redundancies, and metaphor choices (salt air, tides, fabric-textured names) stay coherent to the port/memory palette. Rhythm varies well between longer reflective lines and tighter, action-oriented moments around the label and 9H container. A few abstractions (“my appetite,” “a kind of invisibility that pays in cash”) are handled efficiently enough not to slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, interiority, and theme) without feeling bloated, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is vivid and generally coherent—e.g., “its belly open like a held breath,” “cheerful as a lantern in drizzle”—and not over-stacked to the point of obscuring sense. Rhythm varies enough to keep momentum in a reflective, low-action piece, and grammar/usage are clean. A mild uniformity of lyric density is the only check, as a few lines could afford plainer syntax to set off the most potent images.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-by-line, the prose is dense yet efficient: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, characterization, thematic charge) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Metaphors and images are striking but controlled, and the few heightened phrases remain coherent (“engines like teeth,” “stone heart cracking into many boats”). Information flow is clear despite compression, and paragraphing supports momentum through the setup–plan–execution–aftermath arc. A touch of description-summary in the middle slightly distances us from peak moments, but does not materially harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense without bloat: nearly every line does double duty for character, setting, and theme (“wore curiosity like a tool, sharpened on purpose” is exemplary). Figurative language is apt and sparingly used, with no mixed metaphors or scaffolding loops that slow momentum. Sentence structures and paragraph lengths vary, creating a natural rhythm that supports the accumulating hush and final stillness. The closing sentences land cleanly, with a precise, concrete image rather than any explanatory gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, and theme) with minimal redundancy, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language (“its guidance bird failed… like a trapped insect trying to remember the sky”) is vivid yet controlled, rarely tipping into purple or mixed-metaphor territory. Rhythm varies well between longer, sensuous lines and tighter action beats during the repair and test flight. A few descriptions are lush enough to brush up against over-ornamentation, but they do not impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but disciplined, with many sentences doing triple duty (worldbuilding, mood, and character) and very little scaffold or redundancy. Figurative language—“as if the air itself had been edited into a margin note,” “a quiet verdict”—is vivid and coherent with the cartographic/intellectual lens. Momentum holds despite reflection; transitions between description, thought, and action are smooth and causally clear. A few lines approach the ornate, but they remain legible and motivated by voice rather than sliding into purple.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images often do double duty (worldbuilding plus theme), and there’s little to no scaffolding or explanatory filler. Figurative language is frequent but thematically unified around sound, balance, and bodies as instruments, which prevents it from feeling like random flourish. The prose moves forward with good momentum despite its lyricism, and syntax remains clear. A handful of metaphors (“black as drowned wood,” “houses would quit sounding like coffins”) are vivid but cluster toward the ornate, nudging against but not crossing into overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-by-line, the prose is dense yet efficient: almost every sentence carries multiple loads (world-building, mood, interior state) with minimal scaffolding or synonym loops, and the rhythm alternates long, sinuous constructions with tighter, urgent beats as air runs out. Metaphors are coherent and thematically unified around breath, water, scent, silence, memory; none clash or overreach to the point of muddling sense. There are no noticeable artifacts, redundancies, or mechanical errors, and the final paragraph lands with a clean, charged cadence. The only restraint on a 9+ is that the consistently ornate style slightly risks saturation; a few plainer moments could give the strongest images even more punch.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, with high information density and almost no scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language (“copperlight repose,” “a lantern hung for lost ships,” “the reef began to show its teeth”) is vivid yet coherent, and metaphors do not conflict or pile into muddle. Every sentence either advances the situation or intensifies atmosphere; there’s no synopsis of pivotal beats. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final line elegantly resolves image and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is densely imagistic yet generally precise, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and plot. Rhythm varies well, and crucial beats (her appearances, the resonator’s chord, the final pear) are rendered cleanly without syntactic clutter. There is some stacking of metaphor that edges toward purple, but it rarely obscures sense or momentum. I see very little scaffolding or repetition; line-by-line tightening would be a matter of taste, not necessity for clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is impressive: sentences often do double or triple duty (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without feeling redundant. Figurative language is abundant yet coherent and seldom muddled; images like “paths on it shifted like threads seeking a needle” feel both apt and character-specific. There are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding lines; momentum is maintained despite the lyric style. The prose supports and heightens the closure image rather than overwhelming it.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is tight and purposeful: most sentences carry more than one job (worldbuilding plus character or theme) without redundancy, and there is little to no scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors (library of the dead, ribs as trellises) are coherent and support the core motifs. The prose maintains clarity even in its most lyrical runs, and the final image of the sundial’s shadow “slid forward” is clean, concrete, and charged. A very slight density of imagery in places is the only thing keeping this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is tight: sentences are information-dense, often doing two or three jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without redundancy. Figurative language (“like old pigeons,” “messages ride the skin of the city”) is fresh and coherent, and it doesn’t pile up to the point of obscuring clarity. There are no noticeable synonym loops or scaffold sentences; exposition is efficiently folded into the narrator’s thinking. The only arguable limitation is that the prose stays uniformly lush, so a touch more rhythmic contrast at the moment of discovery might sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level work is dense yet efficient: nearly every sentence does double duty for worldbuilding, mood, and plot, and figurative language is precise (e.g., “whispers from under ice”) rather than ornamental mush. There are no noticeable loops, stock metaphors, or syntactic templates; variation in sentence length and structure keeps momentum high even in descriptive passages. World-specific diction (orrery, manifests, signal beacons) is clear and context-anchored without sliding into exposition. The only arguable weakness is that the consistent lushness might be a hair rich for some venues, but it doesn’t blur action or clarity here.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense but largely earns its lyricism; most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme together) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Imagery is vivid and internally coherent, with recurring metaphors of water, song, and healing stone reinforcing the core emotional arc. A few sentences verge on overload or breathlessness, particularly in chained clauses, which slightly dulls impact in places and could be tightened for elite-level polish. Still, there are no serious clarity failures, and the final image of condensation fading because the choice is made is clean and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are varied, image-rich, and purposeful, often doing double duty for setting, emotion, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern-based (labyrinths, reefs, paper, prayer), without mixed metaphors or density that muddies sense. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence advances pressure or resonance. The closing lines are especially well-cut, with a clear, charged final image that feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but highly controlled, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and metaphors staying coherent to the world of light, fog, and orchards. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic templates; rhythm varies and carries the reader smoothly through an entirely descriptive, dialogue-free piece. A few lines approach the ornate, yet they generally remain clear and image-driven rather than muddled. The final cadence—“bright and practical, like a lamp you can rebuild from scraps” and the new image on the film—lands crisply without explanatory padding.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled; most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, characterizing, thematizing) without collapsing into purple mush. Figurative language—“pause had rooms,” “like listening to a map,” “dolls of attention”—is inventive yet clear, and metaphors are coherent with the acoustic/visual motif. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundant phrasing; momentum is preserved despite lyric elaboration. Line-level rhythm supports the accumulative structure and the closure image rather than obscuring them.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: many sentences do triple duty (worldbuilding, character, and theme) without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors are mostly fresh and apt (“its rattle sounded like a tiny map being unfolded,” “stealing despair, returning curiosity”) and stay within the story’s logic. Momentum is maintained even through more expository beats because information is braided into action and image, not dropped in slabs. There is a high figurative frequency, but it’s pattern-consistent and does not blur sense or closure, keeping this near publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level writing is polished: sentences are varied, figurative language is generally precise, and most lines do double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action). There is a high density of metaphor, but it’s pattern-consistent (reef, shells, light, plants) rather than random ornament, so momentum holds. I see no major loops or redundancy, and the climactic beats (“set the galaxy postcard on the water,” tearing and sinking the pieces, air tasting of the message) are clear and well-paced. An ultra-demanding editor might occasionally ask for micro-trims where imagery stacks, but it doesn’t materially hurt clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with images like “clocks still measuring yesterday” and “a fountain that poured upward into nothing” doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme) without redundancy. Rhythm varies effectively between long, sinuous sentences and shorter, emphatic ones, and there are no noticeable paraphrase loops or template cadences. While figurative language is frequent, it remains coherent and legible, seldom tipping into muddle or self-contradiction. Line-level clarity supports the closure image rather than obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but disciplined, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once) and very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent, yet metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned rather than purple or muddled (“trust drained away like ink in water,” “a chord that made the lamps vibrate”). Rhythm varies well between longer, atmospheric set-up lines and tighter, higher-pressure sentences during the ritual. I see no line-level artifacts or clarity breaks that dull escalation or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but mostly precise, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, characterization, and thematic charge) without obvious redundancy. Metaphors like the building “breath[ing] through warm vents” and “ash like stage dust” are vivid yet coherent; figurative language rarely feels overwrought or mixed. Momentum is maintained despite the conceptual richness; there are no major scaffolding or loop artifacts. A few lines verge on abstraction (“a third language”) but are anchored enough in concrete action to avoid drag.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense yet controlled, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character or theme. Figurative language (e.g., paper carrying music longer than lungs, reinvention as pruning) is fresh, coherent, and not overstacked enough to blur clarity. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; rhythm varies and supports the contemplative but tense mood. Line-level craft easily meets elite-publication standards without obvious artifacts or clunkers, especially in the closing movement.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences pull multiple weights (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without obvious redundancy, and rhythm varies well. Figurative density is high but rarely tips into confusion or mixed metaphor; images stay coherent with the story’s physics and motifs. There are no real scaffold loops or clarity issues; information and emotional stakes advance smoothly. The prose is lush and could arguably be pared in a few spots, but it does not materially drag momentum or blur the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are precise (“small jellies drifted in ceiling cracks like slow thoughts”), multi-functional, and rarely redundant, with almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The prose carries a consistent, musical cadence without slipping into syntactic monotony. There is occasional density of modifiers and metaphor, but it stays coherent and doesn’t blur sense or momentum. It reads ready for publication with only microscopic tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is dense and controlled: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) without obvious redundancy, and the rhythms vary enough to keep the piece propulsive. Figurative language is frequent but usually precise and coherent with the sea/memory/crystal palette, avoiding mixed metaphors or muddle. There are no evident scaffold lines, synonym churn, or mechanical cadences, and the final image of the trail “shimmered into being” lands cleanly. The only restraint on a higher score is that the accumulation of lush imagery edges close to saturation in places and might benefit from an occasional plainer line for contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, often do double duty for image and meaning, and avoid redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically aligned with performance, chess, and tide, so it rarely tips into purple or obscures clarity. A demanding cut could arguably trim a metaphor or two for maximal sharpness, but no artifacts materially dull the closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense yet largely efficient; images usually do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and transitions between beats (panic → rhythmic awareness → bargaining → inscription) are clean. A high concentration of metaphor occasionally edges toward ornament, but it rarely muddies sense or momentum. Line-level craft is publication-ready with no visible grammatical or structural artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense yet controlled, with most sentences doing double duty—advancing physical situation while carrying image or theme (e.g., droplets turning sunrise into “scattered, disciplined colors”). Metaphoric threads (glass, light, ripples) are coherent rather than mixed, and repetition is patterned rather than looped. A few abstractions (“clear complexity,” “silent arithmetic”) slightly risk over-lyricism, but they don’t obscure sense or blunt the closing image, so momentum and clarity remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are generally tight and multi-functional, carrying setting, emotion, and theme simultaneously (“the moon glazing its fractures so they looked like small rivers”). Figurative language is vivid but mostly controlled; the few stacked metaphors (e.g., “crown of fire,” “forest began to scream”) remain coherent and do not blur sense. There are no noticeable scaffold loops or template cadences, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum through reflective passages. A few lines verge on purple or explanatory, but they do not appreciably slow or confuse the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty in scene and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and non-muddled; images like “shops closing with apologies” and “polished a doorway thin enough for data to leak through” are both clear and suggestive. There is mild risk of over-ornamentation, yet momentum generally holds and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. Tightening a couple of slightly abstract formulations near the end could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, with rich imagery that does double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“where sound lingered like memory”; “walls dream about”). Sentence rhythm varies well and maintains momentum through descriptive passages. A few lines verge on density and conceptual repetition around legacy and burden, but they don’t significantly blur clarity or stall the scene. There are no obvious scaffolding loops, mixed metaphors, or grammatical slips affecting comprehension, including at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density—many lines do double duty in worldbuilding, mood, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors and keeping cause-effect legible even in the most lyrical passages. There is mild risk of over-saturation in places (stacked images around the terrace and prism parapet), which slightly blurs edge and urgency. However, there are no notable loops, scaffolding, or clarity breaks, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-by-line craft is strong: sentences are dense yet purposeful, with minimal redundancy and clean syntax. Figurative language (e.g., “the sky itself judged her,” “celestial bodies continued their indifferent waltz”) is apt and not overstacked. The prose largely avoids scaffolding or synonym churn; each paragraph pushes either image, character, or stakes forward. A hair more variation in sentence length at the climax could heighten propulsion, but there are no artifacts that blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is densely imagistic and generally precise; many sentences do triple duty for setting, character, and theme (e.g., riverbeds as “readable scars” that also function as maps). There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors; rhythm moves cleanly from long, sinuous lines to shorter, sharper beats as she acts. The prose does flirt with saturation—nearly every sentence is figurative—which may feel slightly overwrought at this length for some editors. Still, clarity and momentum are preserved all the way through the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and nearly every line advances either tension, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned (threads, echoes, lullaby) rather than ornamental, and there are no obvious paraphrase loops or mechanical cadences. The prose balances compression with clarity, especially around the sanctuary mechanics. A few metaphors (“calm knives,” “metronome”) pile up but do not muddle the scene or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but purposeful, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (“the old equipment stood in shadowed rows like obedient puppets awaiting hands”). Metaphors are mostly coherent and tonally unified, avoiding purple excess even with frequent figurative language. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the prose moves the story forward while maintaining atmosphere. Minor heaviness in a few conceptual phrases is not enough to blunt clarity or momentum, especially as the ending image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is highly polished: sentences are varied, dense with information, and often do double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is fresh and coherent (e.g., monarchs “like sparks from a hidden fire”), without piling on to the point of purple excess. There are no notable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic tics that drag momentum, and the final image lands cleanly. The only slight check against the very top band is that the lyricism is uniformly smooth; a bit more rhythmic risk or strategic roughness in the most pressured beats could heighten impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is outstanding: almost every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without redundancy, and the metaphors are fresh and coherent (“my breath sounded like filings in a bell,” “metal accepted the punctures like lungs taking air”). The rhythm alternates long, sinuous lines with shorter, anchoring ones, creating momentum despite a meditative frame. There is dense figurative work but it remains controlled and unified by motif (casting, absence, light, thaw), with no mixed metaphors or significant loops. I see no mechanical issues or scaffolding; the closure image lands clean and sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, carry multiple functions (image, theme, and motion), and largely avoid redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative choices are fresh and mostly coherent, enriching rather than obscuring—“map made of heartbeat lines” is a standout that also carries conceptual weight. A few phrases lean toward stacked metaphor or could be fractionally trimmed, but momentum rarely stalls. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the closing cadence lands with a precise, charged rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but precise, with many sentences doing double duty—worldbuilding, character, and theme in the same line (e.g., the treasury stripped while “the sky still paid in steady light”). Figurative language is controlled and coherent; recurring phrases like “schematic representations” and “uncloaked” form a semantic mesh rather than purple ornament. There are no significant loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony; rhythm supports the contemplative, accumulating pressure. A slight deduction comes from a few abstractions (“encrypted devotion,” “map of forces”) that could be grounded with one more tactile image, but they don’t materially harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense yet largely efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for world-building and emotional charge (“no echoes, only a pressure in the ears that made every thought feel like a spoken secret”). Rhythm varies, avoiding template cadences or obvious scaffolding, and figurative language is coherent and tonally aligned with the piece. A few lines are heavily loaded with abstractions (“shifting grace,” “cellular memory is communal”) but they remain legible and are quickly grounded in concrete action. Momentum is maintained across the scene without drag or paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level writing is dense but mostly precise: metaphors like “a mountain range made of clear ice” or fog “glimmered like ground glass” are vivid and coherent with the motif. Sentences tend to do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and plot—so the lushness rarely feels redundant, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few passages flirt with over-saturation of figurative language, but they don’t obscure cause-and-effect or the closure image. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final image (“a window where no wall could hold”) lands with sharp, economical force.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and structure, carrying both atmosphere and narrative movement without slipping into redundancy. Figurative language is mostly precise and thematically apt, and exposition is folded into action so that very little feels like scaffolding. I see no significant synonym loops or template cadences that drag momentum, and the final images land cleanly. A few abstractions around “lessons” and “wisdom” could be swapped for images, but they don’t materially blunt the prose’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and character) without bogging down, and the rhythm varies enough to keep the lyricism from turning to purple prose. Imagery is inventive yet legible (star-fruit falling upward, mirrors filing time) with no significant metaphor muddle or scaffoldy repetition. A few abstractions cluster (e.g., “nonlinear inheritance,” “forbidden knowledge”) but they’re grounded quickly by concrete objects, so momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is dense yet controlled, with images that generally clarify rather than obscure: “each step a different alphabet,” “page numbers that skipped, gaps…hummed like a missing note.” Sentences do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, theme, and forward motion—without obvious scaffold or repetition loops. There is sustained figurative language, but it follows a coherent pattern (music/omission/grammar) rather than random metaphor stacking, so momentum holds. A demanding editor might trim a few ornate phrases to sharpen tension, yet there are no artifacts that materially blur causality or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but generally do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without slipping into muddled purple prose. Metaphors (“ferris wheel…like a rusted halo,” “paint itself forgot what it meant”) are striking and coherent, and there’s little to no scaffold or synonym-churn. The rhythm adjusts well between description and key turns, so momentum is maintained in a highly imagistic piece. A few conceptual phrases edge toward abstraction, but not enough to obscure cause/effect or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences are well-shaped and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“labels describing letters that had never been written” is a standout). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with very few mixed or strained metaphors; rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax remains clear even in the most conceptually dense passages. A couple of lines edge toward abstraction, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but largely efficient, with most metaphors doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood rather than becoming purple flourishes. Sentence rhythm varies and supports a feeling of controlled intensity; there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few phrases (“storms made of light,” “braid of pale arcs”) approach ornament, but they don’t obscure clarity or muddle the closure. Information density and momentum stay high despite the lyric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, emotion) with little scaffold or redundancy, and rhythm varies well. Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled and sensical, creating a vivid texture without devolving into muddle. There are no obvious synonym loops or structural tics, and the final cadence lands cleanly on a reweighted concept. A slight tendency toward stacked metaphors in a few spots keeps this just under the very top band, but the prose is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences are information-dense and often do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion, with varied rhythms that suit both hush and storm. Figurative language is abundant but not incoherent; metaphors extend the established imagery (fog as solid, memory as architecture) rather than piling on arbitrarily. There are virtually no paraphrase loops or filler scaffolds, and causality remains clear despite the lyricism. The slight risk of overrichness in places doesn’t significantly blunt momentum or blur key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lyrical but largely disciplined, packing multiple functions (world-building, character, theme) into most sentences without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are coherent and pattern-consistent (gravity, filtering, climbing sparks) rather than random ornament, and the rhythms read well aloud with varied sentence openings and lengths. A few lines risk slight over-articulation of theme, but they don’t muddle clarity or stall action. Information density and propulsion are strong, particularly through the middle and in the fireworks/gate-clearing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is excellent: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually do double duty (world-building plus emotion, or action plus theme). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned (tides, knots, stone, intervals) rather than purple or mixed. There is virtually no scaffolding or synonym loop; each paragraph moves the scene or deepens character and motif. The prose reads clean and publishable as-is, with a strong read-aloud rhythm and a charged final line that crystallizes prior images.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally tight: nearly every sentence advances character, world, and theme simultaneously with high information density. Figurative language is fresh and legible, seldom stacking to the point of clutter, and there are no noticeable loops or scaffolding phrases. Syntax varies smoothly, supporting momentum and breathing-space where needed. The closing paragraph in particular lands with clarity and resonance, reusing prior motifs (plans, jars, hush) without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, varied sentence structure, and high information density—most lines do multiple jobs (world, character, and theme). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, maintaining clarity even in more ornate phrases like “vaulting hush” or “the air would turn hard.” There are no notable loops or scaffold sentences; momentum is steady despite the contemplative mode. The lushness occasionally skirts the edge of over-embellishment, but it never materially obscures causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, dense with information, and rarely redundant; imagery is vivid but generally controlled. Figurative language is frequent but not purple, and most metaphors are coherent and on-theme (static, mosaics, “mineral code”). There are no obvious scaffold phrases, repetition loops, or syntactic monotony that drag momentum. The only minor limitation is that high descriptive density in a few passages slightly softens the sense of forward drive during what could be sharper pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences do multiple jobs, the rhythm varies, and key images (scars as doors, the bell-underwater knock, starlight as water) are memorable and coherent. There is some metaphor stacking and high-density imagery that occasionally teeters toward purple but doesn’t significantly obscure causality. Redundancy is minimal, and exposition is efficiently folded into image. The slight overwriting in places is the main factor keeping this from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense, image-rich, and generally precise, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“promises hardened into real, chalky bricks on her tongue”). Rhythm varies well and there’s little evident scaffolding or repetition. However, figurative language appears in nearly every line, risking saturation and occasional blur where a plainer beat might sharpen impact. The density never quite obscures causality or closure, but at an elite-publication bar it nudges the story out of the 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, information-dense, and nearly every line does double duty for mood and motion (e.g., dust “drawing pale ripples that mapped the invisible pressure lines of sound”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, and there’s little to no scaffold, redundancy, or syntactic monotony. A few metaphors (“first yawn of evening,” “bridge sketched in ash”) flirt with the familiar, but they’re executed cleanly and don’t impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally excellent: high information density, purposeful images doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion, and a rhythm that suits the surreal pressure (“a child's laughter made of steam,” “equations prayed”). Sentences rarely feel redundant, and there are no major clarity issues or logical missteps; events are trackable even through heavy metaphor. However, figurative language is almost continuous, and in a few spots the stacking of modifiers (“shivering bliss,” “soft, chemical rain,” “factually mystical certainty”) edges toward purple, slightly dulling impact through saturation. Trimming or varying the density in one or two peak beats would push this into the topmost band.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often do double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion, theme plus action). Figurative language is rich but mostly disciplined (“as if the war itself had been folded up and shelved”) and supports motif rather than becoming purple. I see no paraphrase loops or scaffolding filler; nearly every line advances scene, character, or atmosphere. A couple of high-level abstractions in the final third flirt with overwriting but don’t materially blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense and image-rich, often doing double duty for atmosphere and world-building while moving the story forward. Sentence rhythm is varied, with only occasional risk of overload from stacked metaphors, mostly in descriptive passages rather than peak-action beats. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax remains clear even where the imagery is ambitious. A tiny trim of explicit thematic phrasing and perhaps one metaphor would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean despite their lyricism, and images do double-duty for mood and world-building (“pale bands that drifted across the water like old postcards”). Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and nonredundant; metaphors align around sound, light, memory, and absence rather than scattering across unrelated domains. There are moments that border on density overload (e.g., several successive metaphor-rich sentences around the prophecy’s cleverness), which slightly slow momentum in the midsection, but they don’t obscure causality or the closure image. No significant scaffolding, loops, or syntactic tics interfere with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, densely informative, and almost always doing double duty (worldbuilding and character, setting and theme). Figurative language is frequent but not purple; metaphors are coherent and rooted in the story’s material vocabulary (seeds, bark, moss, ash) rather than reaching for showy but alien comparisons. There are no obvious loops, scaffolds, or cadence templates that blunt momentum, and the closure beat is sharp and uncluttered. Grammar, reference, and sequencing are clean, making the lyric density fully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense yet efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information (“black flakes still drifted down like moths” quickly evokes aftermath and atmosphere). Figurative language is mostly precise and thematically aligned; the clock and time motifs recur without becoming repetitive scaffolding. There are no noticeable loops, template cadences, or clarity breaks even in the more lyric stretches. At times, the abstraction level inches up (e.g., “to befriend uncertainty in planning”), but it doesn’t significantly slow momentum or obscure action.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is rich, image-dense, and generally precise; most metaphors (“shame that feels newly polished,” “grief itself were luminous”) clarify rather than blur. Sentences pull multiple duties—worldbuilding, mood, and character—without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and rhythm varies enough to avoid a mechanical cadence. The density of figurative language edges close to purple in places, which may slightly slow momentum, but never quite tips into confusion or muddle. Line-level control at the ending is especially strong, with a clean, charged final sentence that reweights prior images.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is highly polished: sentences are dense with information and image without obvious redundancy, and figurative language (“harp waited in a cave like a ribcage,” “river was a ribbon of pewter”) is striking yet coherent. Momentum is maintained even in descriptive passages because nearly every line also advances atmosphere or emotional stakes. I see no notable scaffolding, synonym loops, or muddled metaphors, and the final image is sharp and earned. The slight reason not to push into the absolute top is that the diction stays uniformly elevated, with almost no rougher texture or abrasion at peak emotional moments.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-by-line, the prose is dense yet controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but not self-contradictory, and motifs (ultraviolet ink, confession joints, rosary strap) recur with evolving weight instead of redundancy. The rhythm favors long, sinuous sentences that match the narrator’s hyper-awareness, punctuated by shorter clarifying lines, which maintains momentum despite high information density. The only restraint on a higher score is the near-constant metaphorical pressure, which very occasionally risks blurring immediacy in favor of concept.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and narrative. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern-consistent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess, and key beats (spiral warming, hatch opening, lens joining) are expressed with clarity. There are no significant loops, scaffolding, or cadence artifacts; only a very minor infelicity (“unfasten the rusted latch”) brushes the surface. Overall momentum holds despite lyric density, suitable for a high-end literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: most sentences do more than one job, and images are coherent and non-redundant (“lint on my sleeves,” “breathing shaft,” “last breath” in the mainspring). There’s little scaffold or synonym-churn; progression is clear despite the lyricism, and the closure image is sharp rather than blurred by metaphor. A few lines flirt with purple but stay tethered to concrete action and sensory detail, so momentum holds. Overall, this is polished, publication-ready line work with only minor tightening possible for taste, not necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Metaphor and image are frequent but controlled; “pages fluttering inside glass branches like nervous leaves” and the catalog reordering “by desire rather than title” both advance plot and theme. There’s minimal redundancy and no obvious scaffolding or template cadence. The only drawback is sustained lushness at nearly every line, which risks a slightly uniform texture under pressure, though it remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences are dense yet clear, with metaphors (“visible time… like slow auroras,” storm scraping the hull “like a bow on tarnished brass”) that are fresh and internally consistent. Information is compressed without feeling rushed, and almost every line does double duty for world, character, or theme. There’s no noticeable looping or scaffolding; rhythm varies well. A few sentences push toward the decorative, but they never quite tip into purple or obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: images like “a cathedral of copper lungs” and “a headache of quiet” are fresh and legible, and most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and mood. There is little scaffold or repetition, and momentum is preserved despite dense description. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors hold together and support the tone rather than muddying causality or rhythm. Minor risk of over-richness in a few lines aside, prose is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, purposeful, and often do double duty on image and theme, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but well-controlled (“black water cupped in white,” “joints of memory,” “sky rinsed clean”), rarely slipping into mixed metaphors or obscuring sense. Momentum is steady for a lyric piece; there are no obvious paraphrase loops or template cadences that bog the prose. The density of imagery might be slightly high for some tastes, but it does not materially harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical and information-dense, with images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and non-redundant (“archway…like a broken jaw” is vivid and apt), and the rhythms breathe appropriately around key beats. There is mild risk of lushness—many sentences carry multiple metaphors and concepts—which occasionally softens urgency, but it doesn’t obscure causality or closure. No significant scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony appears.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense but highly efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, and theme) without paraphrasing or bloat. Imagery is fresh and coherent—“etched with vines so fine they looked like scratches on ice,” “an umbral tenderness that made her slow her steps and listen”—with no mixed metaphors or decorative clutter. Rhythm varies well between long, cadenced descriptions and short declarative pivots (e.g., the chilling line on the postcard), giving the piece momentum despite its quiet plot. There are no noticeable line-level artifacts, redundancies, or clarity issues undermining the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but disciplined, with most sentences doing double or triple duty for atmosphere, worldbuilding, and character (“drifted above the coast like a slow, stitched cloud” is emblematic). Figurative language is mostly fresh and coherent, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. A few metaphors verge on richness-for-its-own-sake and could be trimmed for maximum impact, but they rarely obscure clarity. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum from attic to zeppelin to dunes to lagoon without noticeable drag.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and mostly multifunctional, and images like “paper frames nested like bones” or the harbor “quiet as a blown out wick” are striking without becoming purple. Expository compression is efficient and purposeful, especially in summarizing the town’s collapse and gradual return. There are no evident loops, scaffolding, or metaphor muddle; rhythm supports a hushed but forward-moving momentum. If anything, one or two abstract phrases (“economy of miracles,” “reimagine an entire civilization”) slightly thin the sensory texture, but they don’t damage clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without padding. Imagery (“emotional patterns that leak through words like sap through bark,” “the wax kept the pattern like a bruise”) is vivid but not redundant, and metaphors remain internally consistent. There are no noticeable scaffold sentences, loops, or muddled comparisons, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. The prose density suits the piece’s scale and never blurs key beats or causal relations.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with metaphors that are vivid and apt (“as if time itself had been stirred and left to cool in a different shape”) rather than mixed or overextended. Sentences generally do multiple jobs at once—advancing action, deepening character, and reinforcing theme—without paraphrase loops or scaffolding. There is some sustained figurative texture, but it’s patterned and legible, not purple to the point of blur, and momentum never stalls. Grammar and sequencing are clean, particularly around the corridor entry and exit, which remain lucid despite conceptual complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences are dense but purposeful, often doing triple duty (world, mood, motive) without collapsing into purple prose; the opening line’s extended image is ambitious but controlled. There’s strong rhythmic variation and no obvious template cadence, loops, or scaffold, and technical terms are integrated smoothly. A few phrases (“credibly curious,” repeated) verge on self-conscious, but not enough to drag momentum or clarity. The final paragraphs, in particular, are clean and resonant at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush but controlled; images like “clung to a basalt ridge like a barnacle on the night” and “generators ticking like bones” are memorable and coherent, doing character, setting, and thematic work simultaneously. Line-level momentum remains strong despite lyric density, and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. At the level of elite editorial scrutiny, a few metaphors could be trimmed to avoid any hint of overload, but they don’t materially blur sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, densely informative, and most metaphors are original and coherent with the story’s imagery system (bees, ash, light, weight). Figurative language is frequent but purposeful, rarely feeling like decorative excess, and it doesn’t obscure causality or action. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding sentences; each line either advances scene, character, or atmosphere. The only minor constraint is that the sustained richness occasionally risks saturation, but clarity and momentum remain intact through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, characterization, theme) with minimal scaffolding, and imagery is striking yet usually precise (“green light folded inward around it like a closing eyelid”). Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to muddy sense or momentum, and there’s little true redundancy or template cadence. The prose does occasionally explain what a prior image already implies (e.g., reasserting conceptual stakes), which costs a bit of sharpness. Overall, rhythm, clarity, and information density are high and fully publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is rich and rhythmic, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character—e.g., “burnished hush” and “the laughter had edges smoothed by rain.” Figurative language is dense but generally clear and controlled, without mixed metaphors or serious muddle, and sentence variety keeps momentum. Nearly every line advances either scene or thematic pattern; there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. At an elite-publication standard, one might pare a few modifiers to sharpen contrast and prevent slight purple drift, but the line-level craft is overall strong.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is highly polished: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (world-building, characterization, and thematic charge) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is vivid but controlled (“as if stone and wood had signed a pact”; “the orchard insisted on circles”) and avoids mixed metaphors or purple excess. Momentum is maintained despite reflective density because each new image also advances the pattern of interspecies negotiation. The final paragraphs in particular have excellent cadence and clarity, with no discernible line-level artifacts dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, densely informative, and rarely redundant. Imagery is vivid yet controlled; metaphor density is high but patterns are coherent (light, metal, rain, chemistry) rather than random. Technical language is accurate enough for plausibility and integrated smoothly into the lyric mode. There are no noticeable loops or scaffold phrases, and the final sentences land with clarity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and motion) with little waste, and rhythm varies to suit the accumulating ritual. Imagery is rich but not muddled; metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned, with no evident loops or scaffolding. Information density is high without obscuring clarity, and the final lines land cleanly and musically. A tiny minority of lines edge toward decorative flourish, but they don’t significantly slow or blur the core action.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but controlled: most sentences perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and forward motion) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“catwalks of welded rebar and prayer,” “tinted revelations…stained by smoke”) is vivid and largely coherent, with few if any mixed metaphors. Momentum holds despite the richness; expository background is folded into active beats (e.g., learning to read cylinders) rather than halting the story. The main limit keeping this from the very top band is occasional near-purple layering where another beat of plainness might have sharpened impact.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong syntactic variety and high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors are largely fresh and coherent (“unplugged lantern,” “breath unspooled behind me”) without stacking to the point of muddle. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; momentum carries smoothly through reflection-heavy passages. The consistently lush texture verges on saturation in places, which slightly dulls the impact of peak beats that might benefit from sharper, sparer lines.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is musical and information-dense, with metaphors (“stars hang like spilled salt,” “repainting it with a wet brush”) that are vivid yet legible. Sentences do multiple jobs—advancing plot, character, and mood together—without noticeable scaffolding or synonym loops. Rhythm varies appropriately between lyrical description and quicker action beats, keeping momentum intact. A few phrases flirt with lushness, but they don’t blur causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal redundancy, and images that usually pull double duty for plot and theme (e.g., the heel-clicks carried like whispered prayer both open the latch and extend the gallery’s acoustics motif). The figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphor or murk, and the prose flows naturally when read aloud. Momentum holds across the whole piece, with no obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The only limiter is that the density of imagery edges close to purple in a couple of spots, slightly risking saturation in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty for world-building and emotion, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and non-redundant; it enriches rather than obscures action (“feather…like a compass needle made of breath” is both image and mechanic). There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or clunky connectors, and causality remains clear despite the lyric compression. A tiny fraction of metaphors verge on lushness, but they do not blur the closure beat or stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and purposeful, with figurative language that generally carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without muddling sense. Phrases like “as water releases a stone dropped too long in a fist” are striking yet controlled, supporting the emotional beat. There is minimal redundancy, and exposition is folded into image and action. At times the prose edges toward density, but it never seriously drags momentum or obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong, with high information density and metaphors that generally cohere with the story’s metal/bone/light lexicon. The prose balances lyricism with narrative clarity; even complex images like “forged hush” and “listening metal” are legible in context and don’t stall momentum. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and transitions across time (night to dawn) are handled cleanly. A few lines flirt with density that could verge on purple in a longer work, but here they remain purposeful and under control.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously) and very little true scaffolding. Figurative language is sustained and internally coherent: gears, corrosion, lungs, kintsugi, and quilting all interlock rather than clashing. Rhythm varies enough to keep momentum through a largely interior, lyrical piece. The slight drawback is that there are stretches where metaphor and abstraction stack so thickly that readers may need to slow down, which trims a bit of immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, vivid, and rhythmically varied, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, interiority, theme) without feeling burdened. Figurative language is frequent but purposeful and controlled, rarely tipping into purple or mixing metaphors. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum is maintained even through reflective passages. Minor abstraction in a few sentences is noticeable but doesn’t blunt the closure image of the shell, tide, and quay.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is densely figurative but controlled: metaphors are coherent with the world (light as bone, tower as bell, tremor that “makes my teeth sing”) and rarely feel mixed or redundant. Sentences tend to multitask, advancing setting, emotion, and theme in the same line, which maintains momentum despite lyricism. There is minor risk of overload in phrases like “screaming tenderness” plus multiple layered images, but they remain legible and purposeful rather than ornamental. No significant loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony undercut the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is richly figurative but remarkably efficient: most sentences perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously) without padding or loops. Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (tides, hydraulics, maps, mouths), with no noticeable mixed images or rhythm-breaking purple stretches. Information flows cleanly from line to line; there are no scaffold sentences, synonym churn, or cadence templates that dull the crucial beats. Opening and closing images echo each other structurally (broken machinery vs. improvised promise) to strong rhythmic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lean yet lush, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—world-building, characterization, and mood—without drifting into purple. Figurative language is fresh and coherent (“truth…a kind of shrapnel,” “the ravine filled with static empathy”) and rarely, if ever, feels strained; rhythm varies in a way that would read aloud well. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or cadence templates dragging momentum, and syntax remains clear even when imagery is dense. Minor tightening is always conceivable at this level, but there are no line-level artifacts that materially blunt clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence-level craft is exceptionally controlled: varied rhythm, high information density, and figurative language that consistently clarifies rather than muddies (“footprints of intent,” “offering of absence”). There are no discernible scaffold sentences, synonym loops, or syntactic templates; nearly every line carries multiple functions (image, theme, and plot) without feeling overloaded. The prose modulates well—denser in reflective moments, cleaner and more concrete in investigative beats—keeping momentum intact. Metaphors are thematically unified around light, cold, and absence, avoiding mix or drift, which helps the closure image land sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, character, tension) without bloat, and there is minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“ink stains shaped like continents,” “weighed both futures like paper in her hands”) is precise and thematically loaded rather than ornamental. Momentum holds throughout despite descriptive richness; the prose never loops or explains what has just been shown. The final paragraph is especially efficient, compressing physical exit, motif reprise (ants, doorway), and conceptual shift in a few clear, musical lines.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, varied in rhythm, and dense with multi-functioning images that advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. Metaphors are generally coherent and thematically cohesive (lace, embroidery, stitching, bleeding, crowns), and there is little to no paraphrase looping or scaffolding. However, figurative density is high across much of the piece, occasionally brushing against purple—almost every significant beat is ornamented, which can slightly dull impact rather than sharpen it. A touch more sparseness at peak moments (e.g., the descent) would give the strongest images more air.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent: high information density, very few redundant sentences, and metaphors that are coherent and world-specific (“heat…insisted, as if asking every molecule to admit it existed”). Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep momentum, and the prose carries both scene and idea without obvious scaffolding. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, particularly in the closing movement, which slightly blurs urgency and risks decorative overload. That density of imagery trims this from the absolute top band but does not materially obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but generally do multiple jobs at once (advancing image, theme, and emotion). Figurative language is frequent but rarely feels redundant or muddled; metaphors extend rather than clash, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism, with clear sequencing and clean syntax. Minor risk of overload in a few lines, but not enough to blur causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character while maintaining momentum. There’s strong rhythmic variety and very little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the piece reads smoothly aloud. A few phrases verge on thematic labeling (“ordinary miracles,” “be seen”), and figurative density is high in the opening, but these do not significantly obscure sense or undercut the closure image. Overall line-level craft is strong and nearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and forward motion) without padding. Imagery around storms, ink, and scars is precise and non-redundant; there are no significant paraphrase loops or muddled metaphors. Rhythm varies effectively between longer, lyric lines and clipped beats under stress (e.g., the gust, the ink whitening with strain). One could argue the saturation of figurative language is near the upper limit for some venues, but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and images that usually do more than one job (world-building, character, theme). A few metaphors (“shopwork miracles,” “grief is a river…”) stack atop an already-lyric texture and approach over-density, but they remain coherent rather than muddled. There is no serious looping or scaffolding; every paragraph advances situation, emotion, or atmosphere. The only real drag on a higher score is that the figurative saturation occasionally risks drawing attention to itself instead of the beat’s urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and dense with meaning; most sentences do multiple jobs, advancing atmosphere, concept, and character simultaneously (“the air carried incense and dust in equal measure, each mote hovering as though it feared to disturb the hush”). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and pattern-consistent—spirals, corridors, mirrors, and seams recur with clear internal logic. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic templates, and momentum is well-maintained for a lyric piece. The richness does approach saturation in places, where a touch more spareness might sharpen impact, but it never seriously obscures clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, metaphors are mostly clean and thematically aligned, and there’s high information density with minimal redundancy. Phrases like “made even his thoughts seem to drip” and “two blades crossing” are vivid yet controlled, and technical exposition is folded into action. The piece skates close to overrichness in spots (a high figurative density in the opening paragraph) but never quite tips into purple or confusion. No major scaffolding, loops, or syntactic monotony are evident, and causality remains clear even in more lyrical lines.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and thematically coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple overload. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, textured sentences and clipped, charged moments at points of decision. There are no noticeable loops or mechanical cadences that drag momentum, and the final line efficiently recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (scene, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops, and the metaphors are coherent and grounded in the story’s motifs (coins, odds, clover, light grain). The prose approaches lush but rarely tips into purple; modifiers are purposeful rather than decorative. There are no confusing figurative tangles or structural glitches, and the final sentence elegantly braids weather, grief, and the clover image. A tiny reservation is that density is high throughout with few truly plain lines, which could risk saturation in a longer piece but works at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with images that are fresh and coherent rather than mixed; most sentences do at least two jobs (setting tone while advancing interiority or situation). There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and no noticeable synonym churn or template cadence. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and it intensifies rather than blurs crucial beats. The opening and closing lines are especially strong, bookending the piece with sound and reweighted meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally controlled: most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing plot, character, and atmosphere) without padding. Figurative language is fresh (“reeds hiss like paper,” “joy had to borrow a ghost’s throat”) yet restrained enough that it rarely occludes sense or momentum. There are no evident scaffold sentences, loops, or rhythmically mechanical runs; paragraphing supports clear turns in action and interiority. If anything, a demanding venue might trim a phrase or two for even greater sharpness, but no artifact meaningfully dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and images that are fresh yet legible (“her grin was bright but hungry, as if she made jokes the way others made fire”). There’s very little scaffolding or repetition; almost every line does double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, without mixed metaphors or purple bloat, and it flexes with the emotional beats (lighter around Mara’s entrance, steadier and quieter near the end). A few descriptive phrases flirt with lushness, but they don’t slow momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is elegant and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for world, character, and theme; there are no real clarity errors, loops, or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent and often striking (grief as a continent, alphabets tingling into patterns, silence “so complete it felt like snow”), and it generally supports rather than obscures sense. That said, the sustained high density of metaphor across nearly every line means there’s little tonal or textural relief, which some editors may read as borderline over-rich. A touch more variation in plainness vs. ornament would likely heighten the strongest images further.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally controlled: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, emotion) without padding, and metaphors (time pooling like dark water, the nib like a thorn) are coherent and thematically apt. There are no noticeable loops, scaffold sentences, or template cadences; rhythm varies naturally. Figurative density is high but rarely tips into purple, and the prose remains clear even in its most lyric stretches. The closing images (wet-looking scratch, shifting constellations, calm pulse) re-charge earlier motifs with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but purposeful: most sentences carry multiple layers of work (setting, emotion, theme) without obvious padding, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent, staying inside a semantic field of language, music, and breath; mixed metaphors are avoided. Momentum is maintained despite the lyric mode because each image advances the central project of mapping and performance. It’s just shy of flawless only because the sustained metaphorical richness flirts with excess in a couple of spots, though it never quite spills into true purple or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing double duty for image and story rather than lapsing into decorative excess. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and thematically unified around fire, bodies, and archives, avoiding mixed or confusing metaphors. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or clarity glitches; the action sequence remains easy to follow even through ornate description. A few lines flirt with purple, but they’re anchored enough in concrete stakes that momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but purposeful, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion without obvious scaffolding or loops. Metaphors are mostly apt and coherent with the acoustic/light motifs, and the prose maintains clarity despite its lushness. There is some risk of purple density—nearly every sentence is figurative in early stretches—but it doesn’t obscure causality or dull the closure image. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum from induction through overload to the quieter coda.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense yet efficient: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, and forward motion) without scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is selective and coherent, with container-zodiac alignments and acoustic imagery reinforcing theme rather than drifting into purple excess. Rhythm varies naturally, giving breath to descriptive lines and tightening around moments of danger; syntax and punctuation are clean. A few sentences are long and luxuriant, but they remain legible and don’t blur causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is rich and precise: most sentences do double duty for image and emotion, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but remarkably coherent; metaphors extend rather than clash (e.g., darkness “persuaded” rather than banished). Rhythm varies well, with long sinuous lines offset by shorter emphatic sentences at peaks. The lushness edges close to purple in a few spots but never quite tips into muddle or momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences are varied in rhythm, dense with meaning, and generally do more than one job (advancing plot, sketching character, and building atmosphere at once). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent; images like “amplified quiet” and windows forming a chessboard-tree are both fresh and precise. There are virtually no scaffold or loop artifacts, with only a minor copy slip (“librarys”) keeping this from absolute polish. Momentum is maintained even through lush description, and the final lines land with clarity and resonance rather than purple blur.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is excellent: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (world, character, theme) with minimal scaffolding, and the rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language is fresh and controlled (“the island shivered, as if waking from an old oath”; “his guarded heart opened like a hatch”) without slipping into purple or muddled metaphors. There are no visible loops, synonym churn, or clarity breaks, and the final lines land cleanly on strong, concrete images. With one or two even more surprising syntactic or imagistic turns under peak pressure, this could edge into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is highly polished: sentences are musical yet clear, and metaphor (“the air in the rooms still carried her last laugh like a bruise”) is vivid without becoming muddled. Information density is high—most lines do double duty in mood and narrative—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Long, flowing sentences are balanced with shorter ones to control rhythm, especially around key turns like the goat spill and the final realization. It edges toward lushness but never fully tips into purple or obscures cause/effect, and there are no evident technical errors.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with minimal filler, and the read-aloud rhythm is strong. Figurative language is inventive and mostly precise, with few mixed or lazy metaphors; “lantern-moth hush” and “as if the quartz is remembering footsteps” are exemplary. However, the density of imagery is nearly unbroken, especially in the middle, creating a mild sense of saturation that slightly blunts momentum and impact. Trimming one or two stacked metaphors and tightening a couple of explanatory clauses (“the certainty is not arrogance…”) would sharpen the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush but disciplined: images like “new panes like cooled tears,” “map of breath,” and “its cold edge bites her palm like an honest mistake” carry multiple jobs without becoming purple. Repetition of “after the phoenix rises” functions as a framing refrain rather than a scaffolded loop, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. There are no meaning-blurring metaphors or noticeable template cadences; information density is high with little dead wood. A few sentences verge on exposition-heavy (explaining awakening economics) instead of trusting implication, which trims it just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with inventive imagery that usually does double duty for atmosphere and theme (“a sigh that sounded like a crowd turning together”). Sentences vary in length and structure, sustaining momentum without feeling mechanical; there are no evident paraphrase loops or filler scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but not purple: metaphors are coherent with the sonic/light motif and don’t conflict with each other. A few phrases verge on abstraction, yet they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but largely free of redundancy or muddled metaphor; most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action). Figurative language feels unified and legible, avoiding mixed images or purple excess even in high-pressure moments. Sentence rhythm and paragraphing maintain momentum, with longer, image-rich sentences balanced by shorter, decisive turns at key actions (“a single green point to rise”). I see no significant scaffold, synonym loops, or line-level artifacts undermining clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished: sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, characterization) with minimal scaffolding, and figurative language is fresh and coherent rather than piled-on. Rhythm varies well across the long, flowing constructions; there are no obvious paraphrase loops or template cadences dulling momentum. Despite density, clarity holds at both beat and story levels; images like dates encoded in inches and centimeters are complex but instantly graspable. The only mild limitation is that nearly every sentence reaches for some level of metaphor, which risks saturation but here remains just on the controlled side.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and musical, with strong information-per-sentence and very little scaffold or repetition; almost every line advances world, character, or theme. Metaphors are generally coherent and fresh (nostalgia as atoms that cling to “ink, bone, and breath”), and rhythmic variation keeps the long sentences from feeling monotonous. A few stretches verge on purple but remain legible and purposeful, not muddled. There are no noticeable syntactic glitches, loops, or template cadences to dull the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but not redundant, figurative language is coherent and integrated, and almost every line carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and emotion). There are no obvious looped phrases or scaffolding; rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony even in highly metaphorical passages. The prose walks right up to purple without crossing over; its density occasionally risks overshadowing moment-to-moment urgency but never obscures meaning or causality. The final third maintains clarity and sharp imagery, allowing the closure beats to land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and largely efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“her compassion had found a spine” is especially compact and effective). Images are vivid but not generally overwrought, and there’s little in the way of scaffolding or repetition. At times the density of figurative language and abstraction edges toward lushness, slightly softening momentum, but it never obscures causality or the closure image. Line-level craft is well above average and close to publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is dense and elegant: most sentences do double duty, advancing action and image without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but patterned and coherent, leaning into celestial and surgical imagery that the piece has clearly “taught” from the first line. I see no confusing mixed metaphors or syntactic monotony; paragraphing and rhythm support momentum from waking through tunneling to the final street scene. The only arguable limitation is the sheer density of metaphor, which some top-tier venues might ask to be fractionally thinned in the mid-tunnel section to give the most vital images more room to land.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong sentence-level variety and high information density; nearly every line carries character, setting, and theme simultaneously. Images like “projecting nothing but a quivering rectangle of light that felt like an open envelope” are precise, layered, and clear. There is a high density of figurative language, but the vehicles are coherent and largely non-redundant, avoiding the mixed-metaphor muddle that often plagues this mode. A few constructions verge on the epigrammatic (e.g., “To find where unused love is stored…”), which slightly blunts momentum but does not materially obscure cause/effect or the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are information-dense, doing double duty with worldbuilding and emotion, and metaphors are generally precise and non-redundant (“the metal murmured names of stars that had died before any written year”). The rhythm modulates between long, spell-like lines and tighter clauses as pressure or awe rises, sustaining momentum despite a reflective bent. A few phrases flirt with purple but remain coherent and anchored in concrete image, avoiding figurative muddle or scaffolding loops. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and there’s little to no padding or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, densely meaningful, and largely free of scaffold or repetition, with metaphors that are striking yet coherent (“the shack opened like a paper fold”). Figurative language is frequent but not muddled, and it rarely impedes clarity of action or stakes. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs in atmosphere, worldbuilding, and theme—without feeling bloated. A slight risk of over-saturation in imagery keeps it just below the very top tier, but the prose remains controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but precise, with most sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and psychology; images like “a ravine of magnets, with my stomach lurching at the idea of being pulled to one certainty” are both sensuous and thematic. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, winding descriptions and shorter realizations, preventing slog despite the lyrical mode. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and internally coherent; there are no significant mixed metaphors, paraphrase loops, or scaffolding sentences that stall momentum. The only arguable risk is overall lushness, but it’s pattern-taught and aligned with voice, so clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are mostly clean and precise, and there’s minimal redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; motifs (stars, sea, corners vs. straight roads) repeat with evolving weight rather than as churn. The prose maintains momentum even in reflective moments; nothing crucial is summarized away. A few phrases (“every stone seems listening,” “eyes hold maps that do not look like maps”) lean toward the familiar-lyric, keeping it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, metaphors coherent, and almost every line advances character, world, or pressure. Imagery clusters (snow, cold, silence, machinery) are consistent and purposeful, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess despite the lyricism. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or template cadences, and exposition is folded into action (discovering the stair, the underchamber) rather than stalled blocks. Rhythm tightens appropriately around the whisper and the hiding under the piano.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is strong, with many sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and motion—while maintaining clear causality. Images are often striking (“dust fell in slow arcs like collapsed prayers”; “shelves leaning like courtiers bowing out”), and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. At times, figurative density and very long syntactic chains verge on purple, slightly flattening rhythm and making individual turns less punchy than they could be. Still, clarity holds, and the closing cadence is well managed.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is tight, musical, and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs (world, character, theme) without padding. Figurative language (“drifting in its leash like a patient animal,” “periodically eternal”) is fresh and controlled, rarely tipping into purple. There are no noticeable loops, scaffold sentences, or syntactic monotony; momentum is maintained even through reflective passages. A couple of abstract phrases in the final paragraph verge on conceptual rather than sensory, but they do not blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character in one). Figurative language (“thunderous serenity,” “breath they might not get back,” teeth “gently singing”) is vivid and mostly fresh without tipping into purple or muddled metaphor. There is little to no scaffolding, synonym churn, or looped paraphrase, and action order remains clear despite the lyricism. A few sentences are quite long, but cadence shifts appropriately with scene needs and never obscures causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but efficient: most sentences do double duty, advancing world, character, and theme, and there is very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“hair braided tight, as if every strand still carried coded orders”) is vivid and internally coherent, with no mixed metaphors that muddy sense. Rhythm varies naturally, and paragraphing supports momentum from setup through decoding to unsealing. A few lines verge on aphoristic, but they’re grounded enough in concrete context to avoid feeling like free-floating thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty (advancing scene and interior state). Metaphors are apt and consistent—lighthouse lens, crease-lines as “maps of ruined streets,” panic “growing teeth”—with no evident mixing or purple excess. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; rhythm modulates well between calm description and high-pressure beats. The prose supports rather than overwhelms the emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, and motion) and the rhythm varies well, with the closing paragraph landing cleanly. Figurative language is rich (“dust glowed…with a luminescent ache”) yet mostly precise and thematically coherent. There is some risk of over-saturation—metaphors appear in many lines—but clarity and momentum are preserved, so it reads lush rather than purple. Minimal redundancy or scaffold; nearly every sentence advances character or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lean yet vivid, with many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus psychology, or action plus theme) and little redundant scaffolding. Metaphors like “the sky had become syrup” or the drone “like a bright thought that refused to land” are striking but not overstacked, and rhythm adjusts well between reflective and high-pressure moments. Syntax and paragraphing maintain momentum, and there are no noticeable loops, muddled images, or grammatical distractions. The piece is very close to elite-line quality; an editor might only trim a handful of explanatory phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but purposeful, with most sentences carrying multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without slipping into muddle. Figurative language—buried bell, thawed rumor, stirred pond—is consistent and rarely mixed, supporting the freeze/thaw motif. Momentum holds despite reflection because each reflective beat tilts the current choice rather than stalling it. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or register breaks that blur the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense but largely efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character or plot. Metaphors (e.g., soot like dark snow, quiet as gravity pulling sand into a steady slope) are vivid and coherent without stacking to the point of purple excess. There is little scaffolding or redundancy; momentum stays intact even with long sentences. A few phrases (“senselessly perceptive attention”) flirt with ornament, but they do not obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious redundancy. The figurative language is dense but controlled and thematically coherent around sound, pattern, and lullaby; there are no mixed metaphors or purple excess that obscure sense. Syntax is varied, transitions are fluid, and there’s no noticeable scaffolding, loop, or template cadence. The final sentences land cleanly and recharge prior motifs without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for character and theme (“she treated every headline like a planet”). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and mostly non-redundant, with the planetary/ink motifs tightly controlled rather than florid. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances mood, plot, or character. The occasional on-the-nose image or explicit metaphor keeps it just short of exemplary minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is tight, with high information density and minimal scaffolding; nearly every sentence advances character, world, or emotional atmosphere. Metaphors like “baby crying under water” and “observatory ceiling seemed to open like night water” are vivid, coherent, and thematically linked, not gratuitous. There are no prominent loops or template cadences; rhythm modulates naturally between exposition and the climactic beat. A couple of abstract formulations (“failures in their bones,” “stored need”) come close to summary, but they don’t significantly blunt momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character or worldbuilding. Figurative language is frequent yet internally consistent in image families (sound, lilac/mist, chalk/sand), avoiding mixed-metaphor muddle. There’s little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or template cadence; the paragraphing supports momentum from observation into action and then into a quiet but charged close. At moments the lyricism flirts with overrichness, but it doesn’t obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is tight, image-rich, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with consistent metaphor families (fire/ash, stone/mosaic, metal/embrace) that avoid muddle. Rhythm varies naturally, and key beats—Samir setting the tessera, the cuffs clicking “like winter”—land with clean, memorable phrasing. The high density of lyricism risks slight saturation, but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are well-shaped, syntactically varied, and densely informative, often doing double duty for character, world, and theme. Figurative language is rich but mostly precise and controlled, with sensory metaphors grounded in Mara’s synesthesia rather than generic ornament. There’s little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or awkward phrasing, and momentum carries smoothly into the climax and through the final image. The prose is stylistically ambitious yet remains clear at closure, with no figurative muddle in the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled: most sentences do double duty, advancing plot while deepening image or theme. Metaphors are original and coherent with the world (light, fracture, maps, anxiety), and they rarely stack to the point of obscuring meaning. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffold; summary is used strategically to compress non-crucial stretches of time. A touch of lyric saturation in the middle could be trimmed for even sharper momentum, but it does not materially blur causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but controlled: sentences often perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and characterization) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is apt and coherent with the sensory-map-maker premise, and there are no noticeable loops or scaffold phrases that stall momentum. Rhythm and sentence length vary well, especially around the tide entrapment and fossil-floating beats. The only small limitation is that the consistently lush style occasionally risks softening the sense of imminent danger from the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, nearly every sentence performing multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character, theme) without obvious redundancy. Metaphors are frequent but controlled and coherent (“unearthed silence,” “buttons as letters in an alphabet nobody owned”), and they track the piece’s core concerns rather than drifting. Syntax is varied, with no noticeable template cadences or paraphrase loops, and the final image (“the air felt lighter”) cleanly distills accumulated motifs. Very minor risk of over-richness in spots, but it never muddies action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal redundancy, and images that are generally clear and precise (“mist slipped across the marks like breath over a mirror”). The recurring figurative language around wind, snow, and hush forms a pattern rather than purple excess, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. There are a few spots where abstract phrasing tilts toward the general (“simple and stranger than loyalty,” “unused courage waits”) and could lean more on concrete embodiment. Still, clarity and propulsion are never compromised, and the closure image is crisp and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally high: sentences are musical, information-dense, and varied in rhythm; there’s very little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Repeated motifs (spindrift serenity, ticking gutters, percolating tea) feel intentional rather than redundant and are repurposed at the end. However, the prose edges into purple in places, with stacked metaphors and ornate phrasing that occasionally risk calling attention to themselves over the moment. Despite that lushness, causality and closure remain clear, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is highly polished: images are precise (“chimney smoke flattens against a low sky,” “broken hives stacked like little kilns”), sentences carry multiple functions at once, and there is essentially no scaffold or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but generally disciplined and thematically cohesive around pottery, bees, and light/time. A few metaphors verge on density (“phototropic to kindness,” “world with cracked seams”) but they remain legible and do not obscure causality or closure. Rhythm varies well, with long, sinuous descriptives balanced by tighter, action-focused lines in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is economical, with most sentences doing double duty for image and character, and there are no obvious scaffolds or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and un-mixed; motifs (bones in moonlight, light ladders, oars) recur in disciplined ways that support closure. Rhythm varies nicely, with longer, winding sentences in calmer moments and tighter phrasing at points of action or decision. The density is high enough that a single extra flourish could have tipped into overrichness, but as is, momentum and clarity remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but purposeful; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without sliding into mush. Figurative language is original and largely clean—images like “the clouds rolled like a pale surf” and the hum vibrating in teeth are sensuous but legible. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. One could argue for slight ornamental excess in places, but it doesn’t obscure causality or dull the closure; line-level craft would already be competitive in high-end venues.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: images are precise and original, and most sentences do double duty advancing atmosphere and character (“their ladders made thin reflections in the water”). Figurative language is frequent but disciplined, with echoing motifs (thread, spiral, seam) rather than scattershot metaphor; it never obscures basic sense. There’s little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic monotony, and the prose modulates well between description and action. The climactic paragraph remains clear despite its lyric density, which is difficult to pull off.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: dense but generally efficient, with images like “braided sound to starlight” and “prayer spoken through concrete” doing multi-layered work. There’s minimal redundancy, and exposition about tricksters or university politics is compact and integrated into forward motion. A few metaphors flirt with richness bordering on saturation, but they remain coherent and don’t obscure causality or stakes. The final third, in particular, is clean and propulsive without noticeable scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense with metaphor but rarely tips into muddle; images like “doorways voted” and “corridors declared spatial mutiny” feel fresh and internally consistent. Sentences often do multiple jobs at once—advancing action, articulating world rules, and revealing character—without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. The long periodic structures might strain some readers, yet rhythm generally tracks pressure well, tightening around peril and relaxing slightly in reflection. There are no significant clarity lapses or figurative tangles that obscure causality, which is impressive given the lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, character, theme) with high information density and minimal scaffolding. Metaphors are fresh and controlled, rarely stacking in ways that blur sense. Rhythm shifts appropriately between reflective compression and present-tense movement (e.g., the shift from studio method to dawn at the quarry). A few phrasings repeat conceptual ground (e.g., reiterating the town’s looking-away) but not enough to drag momentum or obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but controlled: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is fresh and mostly coherent with the maritime/weather frame, avoiding mixed metaphors or therapy-speak. Syntax varies and supports momentum; no paraphrase loops or template cadences significantly slow the piece. It stops short of purple excess, though one or two images (“station lights haloed by fog and the air tasting of rust”) flirt with overrichness without tipping into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, character) and the figurative language is striking yet legible (“a flag that refused to choose a country,” “measured my future with a shard of his past”). There is a high density of metaphor, but it rarely feels gratuitous or muddled, and momentum is maintained. I see minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is taut and image-dense without slipping into muddle; lines like “dust fell like stage glitter” or “my own polished calm like a clean shirt” do multiple jobs at once. There’s strong propulsion: nearly every sentence advances either plot, world, or theme, with minimal scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is thematically unified around loops, borders, and performance, avoiding mixed metaphors. A few abstractions (“roads that bent people into returning”) flirt with telling, but they remain anchored enough in concrete context to keep momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences are information-dense and often do double duty—moving plot, deepening character, and reinforcing motif in the same line—with very little scaffolding or repetition. The figurative language is rich but controlled and consistent with the story’s lexicon (stars as breath, words as bridges, observatory as ship), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess that would blur sense. Rhythm varies nicely, with longer, sinuous lines in reflective passages and tighter units around key turns (the revelation in the dream, the rite in the temple). If anything, the density skirts the edge of lyrical saturation, but it never seriously impairs clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally elegant and information-dense, with many lines doing triple duty (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) and a good rhythmic variation between long, lyrical sentences and more direct ones. Metaphors (“laughter turned to ash,” “mirror bent like a scowling face,” “serene as a shield wall”) are strong and coherent, with only occasional flirtation with overload. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and causality stays clear despite the density of imagery. A slight tendency toward stacked figurative language in some sentences keeps this just below the very top band but does not seriously impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, with high information density and minimal scaffolding. The figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and thematically coherent (rails, eclipse, hedges, scars, roots), avoiding mixed metaphors or muddle. There are no noticeable loops or synonym churn; each sentence tends to add a new layer of image, world logic, or emotional nuance. The only small limiter is that the density of metaphor occasionally edges toward excess, risking, though not crossing into, slight saturation in such a short span.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (world, mood, character) without redundancy, and rhythm varies to support both atmosphere and turns. Figurative language is frequent but rarely overwrought, and metaphors tend to cohere around the orchard/fruit/bone/destiny lexicon. There are no noticeable loops, template cadences, or filter-verb stacks dulling momentum. The final sentences are especially clean and weighted, landing the emotional and conceptual cost without padding.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is tight, with high information density and almost no scaffolding or synonym loops; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus character, or memory plus theme). Figurative language (e.g., “echo valley,” “stone throat,” “facts felt like earplugs”) is vivid and coherent with the acoustic motif without becoming purple or muddled. Rhythm varies well across exposition, memory, and the closing revelation, giving the ending room to land. Line-level work feels largely publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty, advancing worldbuilding and interiority together, with few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Figurative language is vivid and mostly controlled (“clouds…ripple like parchment dipped in ink”; “seed remembered every question ever asked”), helping rather than hindering clarity. Rhythm is varied and suits a lyric, reflective piece, and there are no evident grammatical or sequencing slips. The concentration of imagery in some stretches comes close to purple but stops short of obscuring action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is dense yet precise; nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously) without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is fresh and coherent, and it’s not overstacked at any high-pressure beat, so there’s no purple drag. Rhythm varies naturally with a mix of long, sinuous sentences and shorter declarative ones for emphasis, especially at turns (“Yet acceptance did not solve the problem…”; “I slid the plate into my coat…”). Grammar and sequencing are clean; there are no loops or artifacts that blur causality or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-by-line, the prose is tight, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and story. The figurative language (e.g., crystals as “listening ears”) is inventive yet legible, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. There are no evident synonym loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic monotony; the paragraphing supports movement from inspection to revelation to communal ritual. A few abstract formulations of motive and realization could be sharpened into image, but they don’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, theme) without redundancy or muddled metaphor. Figurative language is consistent with the established imagery of water, measurement, and rail infrastructure, and it doesn’t over-saturate the highest-pressure beats. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic templates dragging momentum. The final sentences in particular are clean, propulsive, and resonant without purple flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but generally precise; most sentences do multiple jobs at once (world-building, interiority, and thematic hinting) without obvious padding or loops. Figurative language is fresh and coherent, and there are no mixed metaphors or cliché clusters undermining key moments. Momentum is maintained despite the complex conceit; exposition about the library’s timing-language is folded into active decoding rather than static explanation. A few sentences verge on overlong, and a touch more pruning at the heaviest descriptive points would sharpen impact, but the line-level craft is already near publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions (world, mood, and action), and the closing image cleanly crystallizes the story’s concerns. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and anchored (“destiny here was perforated, full of little holes where choices leaked through” exemplifies density without muddle). There are no obvious scaffolding loops or template cadences, and grammar and pronoun usage are clean. The only restraint on a higher score is that the rich metaphoric load is very near the upper limit a short scene can sustain before risking saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is dense and purposeful, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Imagery is consistently fresh and internally coherent: “a pearl caught in a net of light,” “a sigh of light that filled the grotto with a radiant hush,” “a heartbeat trying out a new home” all deepen the same tonal field. Despite high figurative density, rhythm and clarity remain intact; the action of the ritual and final choice is easy to follow. The only ceiling comes from the sheer uniformity of lushness—there’s little strategic spareness or contrast that might give the brightest lines even more impact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple jobs (image, theme, and forward motion), and the overall flow is propulsive despite a reflective mode. Figurative language is dense but mostly precise and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or real opacity, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The long opening sentence is ambitious yet legible, teaching the lyrical pattern effectively. The only modest drag is that the sustained richness of metaphor occasionally risks oversaturation, where one or two beats could breathe more with plainer language.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: rhythms vary, images are precise, and most lines do double duty for mood and character without bogging momentum. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically unified around sight, light, wind, and burden; metaphors rarely feel mixed or ornamental. There are almost no paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases; information density is high for the length. A few phrases verge on conceptual rather than sensory, but they do not materially obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is polished and musical, with high information density—most sentences advance both atmosphere and concept. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and thematically aligned (magnetism, ripples, filings, hush). There is some risk of overrichness, yet clarity is preserved and key beats (the revelation of the grotto’s effect, Lior’s disappearance) land cleanly. I see little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) with few redundancies, and the imagery is original and sensorially grounded. Metaphoric density is high but generally controlled; bone as organ, echoes as “dust memories,” and rhythms as maps all cohere rather than clash. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences, and the final lines land with clarity. The lushness flirts with purple in places, slightly softening momentum, which keeps this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is highly polished: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, character) with little to no scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythm varies in a way that supports momentum. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; images like “a ledger,” “laughter trapped in ice,” and “a candle refusing orders to die” feel fresh and apt rather than piled-on. There are no obvious loops, template cadences, or clarity breaks, and the closure image is crisp and legible. At a very high bar, one could argue the density of metaphor edges toward lushness, but it never materially slows or muddies the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and musical, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing action, deepening atmosphere, and revealing character simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern-consistent, contributing to momentum instead of stalling it, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or filler sentences. A handful of images approach the edge of purple (“breathing silt,” “opened like a throat”) yet stop short of muddling sense or obscuring causality. Overall rhythm and clarity would stand up well in an elite publication with only very light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are information-dense, generally do multiple jobs at once, and maintain forward momentum despite the conceptual load. Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent (coins, chords, folds, loops), with few if any mixed metaphors or padding. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the final images (edgewise coin rolling, chord heard before it is played) are sharp and earned. A very small trim of adjectival density in mid-paragraphs could sharpen the already impressive effect.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is lush yet controlled: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) without slack or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically unified around light, sound, and the sea; it rarely tips into muddle or mixed metaphor. Rhythm varies nicely between long, sinuous lines and shorter emphatic beats (“I am a heartbroken reaper, and even my footsteps keep distance from the lives I take.”). Line-level clarity remains high even in peak lyrical moments, and the final sentence lands cleanly without ornament bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense but finely honed: images like “nets hang like empty ribs” and “cooled flame” are precise, fresh, and thematically resonant. Sentences often do double duty—advancing worldbuilding, mood, and character in one move—without obvious scaffolding or echo loops. Rhythm modulates well, slowing around the drip-counting and tightening around the bell’s ringing. Figurative language is frequent but not muddled; metaphors stay within a cohesive marine/mechanical/celestial palette and never obscure action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished: sentences carry multiple functions (image, theme, character) with very little scaffolding or redundancy, and figurative language is fresh and internally coherent. Information density is strong—nearly every line advances mood, plot, or meaning—and there are no obvious loops or template cadences. The lyricism approaches lushness but stops short of purple; metaphors like water “listening” and the town as “audit” feel precise rather than ornamental. Minor tightening could be possible, yet nothing meaningfully obscures clarity or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong verbs and layered images that often do multiple jobs at once (e.g., the starlings as both phenomenon and diagram). Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or action. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and well-chosen, avoiding mixed metaphors and purple bloat. Occasionally the density of imagery risks over-luxuriance in a high-pressure moment (the experiment proceeds very smoothly in language as well as plot), which trims the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense yet controlled: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and information, and figurative language tends to be purposeful rather than ornamental (“leaves like black glass,” “sky itself seemed frayed”). Rhythm varies; long, sinuous lines in reflective moments give way to more clipped, direct phrasing around the tactical beats of revision and capture, maintaining momentum. There are no meaningful scaffold loops or syntactic templates, and metaphors remain coherent with the story’s physical and emotional logic. A touch more spareness in one or two metaphor-heavy sentences could heighten impact further, but current line-level craft is well within elite-publishable range.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense but generally precise, achieving high information-per-sentence with minimal redundancy; images like “a well trained puppet” and “my chest felt like an empty drum” are vivid and efficient. Rhythm varies well across long, flowing sentences and sharper, declarative lines at key turns, keeping momentum through a complex concept-load. Now and then, figurative and abstract language stack (“vivify what the rewrites had dulled,” “the dojo art that slices through pretense”) in ways that feel slightly ornamental rather than strictly necessary. Overall, line-level craft is strong and clear, with only light tightening needed for peak-pressure economy.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are generally efficient yet layered, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and thematically coherent (storm, silence, mazes, doors), not random ornamentation. There are no major clarity lapses; action order and causality remain legible even in denser passages. A few metaphoric clusters (“storm-born silence,” “hush of a possibility just born”) edge toward lushness, but they don’t materially drag momentum or obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense but purposeful: metaphors (laughter as something that “binds to what is broken down and made new”) tend to carry conceptual weight rather than decorate. Sentences frequently do double duty—advancing plot while deepening mood or theme—so momentum is retained despite lyricism. A few lines verge on overload (“true haunting lives in those details,” stacked sensory clauses), but they remain coherent and do not obscure causality or closure. There is little to no scaffolding, synonym churn, or obvious template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, mostly clean syntax, and figurative language that tends to carry multiple loads (atmosphere, theme, character) without collapsing into mush. Phrases like “worshiped dawn as a knife” and “eyes bright as trapped moons” feel fresh and controlled rather than derivative, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn. The prose does verge on consistently lush, which might be slightly heavy for some markets, but the pattern is taught early and remains legible; key beats (the lunge, the breath, the final card) are not obscured. I see no real artifacts or loops that drag momentum, only a deliberate density.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and almost every line does multiple jobs (world, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and coherent, with recurring motifs (ember, frost, bloom) rather than random metaphor churn. A demanding editor might flag the density of images as edging toward purple in spots, but clarity and momentum are never lost, including at the climax. There are no noticeable grammar, tense, or sequencing slips.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with minimal scaffolding, and imagery is vivid but generally disciplined. Phrases like “the remaining city, lighter by one arrogance” and “a shard of hush…could swallow interference the way sand drinks water” are inventive without obscuring sense. There is a consistent, mildly lush lyricism, but it avoids purple excess or metaphor pile-ups that would blur action or stakes. I see no significant loops, clunky syntax, or clarity failures, only an occasional density that a top-market editor might trim slightly rather than fundamentally revise.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is graceful and information-dense, with nearly every sentence doing double duty for atmosphere and story. Metaphors are apt and cohesive (engines “turning pages,” clocks “crabbing” along the wharf, water forming the hourglass pattern) without crowding each other. There’s no evident scaffold, synonym churn, or cadence templating; rhythm varies naturally across beats, and the closure image is crisp and unfuzzy. A couple of complex sentences verge on lush, but they remain clear and do not impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple loads (plot, image, theme) with minimal scaffolding, and rhythm varies without algorithmic repetition. Figurative language is dense but controlled and internally coherent; metaphors like “a quiet so smooth that it scraped” or “my proof lines no longer led to the exit” sharpen rather than blur sense. There are no noticeable loops or synonym churn; information advances steadily toward closure. The only limiter from a top-tier score is that the prose occasionally verges on uniformly lush, leaving little space where plainer texture might heighten contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and figurative language that’s both legible and thematically aligned (“grief and wonder braided together,” “probe sat like a broken pearl”). Sentences often do double or triple duty—worldbuilding, theme, and character in one. There’s some repeated conceptual phrasing (horizon, unfold, edges) but it reads as purposeful motif rather than loop. The prose is just shy of the kind of razor-surprising phrasing that would push this into the 9-band, but it’s already at a strong literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and plot) and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Imagery (the hearing aid’s “faint electrical stutters,” static that “sounded almost like relief”) is precise and thematically charged without becoming purple. Syntax and paragraphing maintain momentum through the central confrontation, and the final sentence elegantly knots image, theme, and character. Any minor repetition feels pattern-driven rather than accidental and does not blunt the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (setting, mood, character) with minimal fluff. Metaphors are vivid and controlled, rarely mixed, and they reinforce motifs (voice/noise, ghosts, mouths). There’s no obvious synonym-churn or scaffold; rhythm and syntax feel deliberate and varied. The final line elegantly reweights the opening without spelling out its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is polished: images are fresh (“telescope points like a sleeping spear,” “hard drives tick like small insects”), syntax varied, and there is minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but controlled; metaphors tend to cohere around light, static, fragmentation, and cold, avoiding mixed or confusing imagery. Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances setting, character, or theme—and the prose flows smoothly without noticeable loops. A few abstractions around failure and memory edge toward expository, but they do not materially slow the piece or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but highly controlled: images are specific and layered (“towers of bone rose like ruined organs,” “a sentence that meant, Listen to what you touch”) and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and mood at once). Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and pattern-consistent—organs, ribs, throats, echoes—avoiding mixed metaphors or sludge. Momentum holds despite lyricism; even summarizing phrases (“Day after day…,” “Years later…”) are purposeful transitions rather than padding. A few sentences verge on ornate, but they do not blur meaning or dilute the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and information, and there’s little to no scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are generally coherent and thematically aligned (gravity, song, thaw/frost) rather than ornamental; rhythm varies nicely across long, sinuous sentences and tighter beats at the climax. Clarity of action remains strong even when the language turns lush—e.g., “Jonas's shadow peeled away from his feet” is both vivid and precise about what’s happening. A mild risk of over-saturation in metaphor around the opening might prompt a demanding editor to trim a line or two for breath and emphasis.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and usually perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined and coherent; it rarely muddies sense or repeats itself. Momentum holds through the climax with no obvious scaffold phrases or paraphrase loops, and the final image lands cleanly. At times the lushness edges toward saturation, but it doesn’t materially obscure action or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythm varies pleasingly. Figurative language is frequent but precise and thematically aligned (“thin as a folded envelope,” “brittle hush”), with no noticeable mixed metaphors or purple overgrowth that blur meaning. Syntax remains clean and readable even in high-pressure moments like the storm’s release. The only minor limitation is that a couple of thematic sentences could be fractionally more embodied, but they don’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is rich and image-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, character, and theme; “a lace of wind bells…chiming time into the fog” is representative of this efficiency. Line-level clarity and grammar are clean, and momentum generally carries despite the lyric pacing. There is some stacking of metaphors (silence as fog on the tongue, misting hush, whispering gleam) that could be pared to sharpen impact, but they remain coherent rather than muddled. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts slow the crucial beats of discovery, repair, and song.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are information-dense, often doing multiple jobs (world-building, character, theme) without obvious scaffold or repetition. Figurative language is fresh and internally coherent (“bookmark for the air,” “time had been stored without electricity”), and rhythm supports the story’s meditative but forward-moving feel. I see no significant paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors, and the final line neatly crystallizes prior images without over-explaining. The only restraint on a higher score is that the density of figurative texture is uniformly high; a slightly sharper contrast between plain and heightened diction at pivots could add even more punch.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are precise, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“salt-stiff hands and stories that needed shelves,” “the same outline that had left her bed years ago”). The figurative language is dense but generally coherent and pattern-consistent; it rarely tips into muddle or redundancy, and the narrative flows without noticeable scaffolding or loops. Pacing is well-modulated for a lyric piece, with no major bog-downs in exposition. A few lines brush close to purple, but they don’t obscure causality or the clarity of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level work is highly controlled: images are vivid and original (fear “wrapped around the idea like paper around glass”), and most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative density is high but patterned and purposeful, never so baroque that it obscures sense or causality. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or mixed metaphors; rhythm varies naturally and supports the scene’s emotional arc. The final sentences land cleanly, with strong propulsion and no clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and efficient, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, characterization, and thematic echo) and very little scaffolding or repetition. Rhythm varies nicely, and figurative language is generally fresh and coherent. The only small drawback is that the metaphorical density is consistently high, which risks slight purple-tinge in places and leaves limited room for plainer, contrastive lines that could sharpen a few peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with high information density and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, with sustained metaphors (angles, mirrors, hinges, breath) that echo the thematic concerns rather than piling up randomly. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, sinuous sentences and clipped, charged lines around key beats (“Steady, because the city watches for any tremor to call you unfit.”). There are no noticeable loops, muddled metaphors, or clarity issues, and the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with many sentences doing triple duty for setting, theme, and emotion; line-by-line, it generally reads clean and deliberate. Some metaphors cluster (“air itself sounded like a hymn… a radiant hush…”) verging on purple, but they stay coherent and do not obscure causality or sequence. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; each paragraph advances stage or pressure. A touch more spareness around the climax could heighten propulsion, but as-is the lyricism is controlled rather than indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, with metaphors that remain coherent and apt (“ringing in my skull like a bell heard underwater,” “stone lifted like an eyelid”). Almost every line does multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and action—without visible scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The density of imagery is high but controlled; there’s no figurative muddle and clarity of action is preserved throughout the ritual. Opening and closing lines are particularly strong, bracketing the piece with reweighted images of the sanctuary and the world’s throat.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense yet efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for character, setting, and theme (“dividing known from unknown like a wound”; “even their erasures seemed forgiven”). Rhythm is varied enough to keep momentum, and there are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or figurative muddles. A few sentences are long and slightly ornate, but they remain clear and purposeful rather than purple. Line-level craft is clearly publication-ready in an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus theme, or action plus interiority) and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are fresh and largely coherent with the underwater/diving and physics motifs; they rarely feel strained. There is a fairly high figurative load, but rhythm and clarity hold, and closure is sharp rather than muddied. I see no significant loops or line-level artifacts that slow momentum or confuse causality.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but purposeful: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, interiority, and motion), and figurative language stays coherent and grounded in the established aesthetic. There are no noticeable scaffold loops or synonym churn; each paragraph advances situation or deepens emotional charge. Rhythm varies well, and crucial beats (the chip warming, the spark-reading, the final glyph) land in clear, vivid lines. The occasional ornate phrase never tips into muddle, so momentum remains intact despite the lyric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled: long sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and action) without feeling overstuffed. Figurative language (“frozen candle,” “ladder built out of light”) is sharp and coherent, with no mixed metaphors or momentum-killing loops. Sentence and paragraph rhythms vary naturally, and there are no visible scaffold phrases, synonym churn, or clarity issues around key actions like pulling the brake and escaping. The stylistic intensity is high but remains legible, earning a strong line-level score.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but mostly precise: images like “rocking under the airship like a loose tooth in dusty starlight” and “edges sparkled like crushed mica in moonlight” are vivid, multi-function, and well controlled. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and there’s very little scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line does double duty in atmosphere and character. At times the figurative load is heavy enough to flirt with purple, which very slightly blurs the mechanics of the radio/signal recovery if read too literally. Nonetheless, clarity survives, and momentum carries through to a crisp, charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is dense and controlled: images like “chapel that had forgotten its prayers” and “galaxies implied in flecks of ash” pull double duty for atmosphere and theme. Sentences mostly avoid redundancy and keep propulsion even while being lyrical, and information is packed efficiently into each paragraph. A handful of metaphors stack near the opening, flirting with overrichness, but they remain coherent and don’t blur sense or slow the core action. Overall, there’s very little scaffolding or looped phrasing; nearly every line earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and action, and the figurative language is mostly fresh and grounded in the scene. Moments like “leaving only a pale, trembling sheen that clung to glass” or the hopscotch spirals echoing starling wings are vivid without obscuring meaning. There is some risk of metaphor density and long, multi-clause sentences verging on lushness, but they remain legible and do not materially slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and structure, and most carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and non-redundant, with few, if any, mixed metaphors. There is minimal scaffolding or synonym-churn; the prose maintains momentum despite its density. The only restraint on a higher score is that the sustained ornateness occasionally edges toward saturation in a short piece, flirting with overrichness in spots.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing double or triple duty in advancing plot, atmosphere, and theme; there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn. Figurative language is vivid yet coherent (orchard thorns echoing emotional snags, arches as bridges and relays), and metaphors generally align with the world’s material logic. Syntax and paragraphing vary in pace to match summary versus key beats, maintaining momentum despite reflective passages. No significant line-level artifacts, redundancies, or clarity issues blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level work is dense and musical, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, theme, and emotional shading) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Metaphors and repeated phrases (“nested patterns,” “bruised awe,” “beautifully flawed”) form coherent motifs rather than feeling like churn, and the syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. A few passages verge on purple but do not obscure causality or the closure image; the action beats remain traceable. There are no noticeable grammatical slips or template cadences that would require substantive tightening before publication.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense yet controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character at once) and very little scaffold or redundancy. Figurative language (“a dent shaped like mercy,” “reluctant applause”) is vivid, coherent, and aligned with the world’s logic. Rhythm varies well, avoiding template cadences or synonym churn, and the final sentences land with precise, charged images. The only restraint on a higher score is that the lyricism is nearly continuous, which in a few spots slightly competes with the immediacy of on-page danger.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing double duty (science and emotion, setting and theme). Figurative language is frequent but not muddled; the central braid/foam/chrysalis metaphors are coherent and sustained. There are few if any scaffold or paraphrase loops; rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. A slight tendency toward conceptual phrasing in a few lines keeps it shy of the very top tier, but the line-level craft is solidly elite.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is lush but purposeful: images like “speech broken into photons” or a title that is “only a hole” do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, theme, emotional shading). Sentence rhythms are varied, and there are no obvious scaffolding phrases, synonym loops, or mixed metaphors; nearly every line advances character or concept. Despite the density of figurative language, clarity holds throughout, including at the closure beat. One could argue for minimal trimming, but there’s no real momentum drag or opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is exceptionally controlled: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (world-building, mood, and character) without redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors are abundant but coherent, all orbiting taste, water, salt, coral, and memory in a way that builds rather than clutters. There are no noticeable loops, filler beats, or line-level confusions; rhythm supports the story’s shift from tense exploration to quiet, communal release. The final paragraphs in particular achieve high information density and emotional charge without slipping into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; many lines carry setting, character, and theme simultaneously (“air carried stories better than paper” compresses history, voice, and concept). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding; sentences progress the scene rather than circling it. A few phrases flirt with purple or abstraction (“construct bridges from silos” is repeated both as concept and near-tagline), and some of the work montage is summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly dulls immediacy. Nonetheless, clarity holds, and the final image lands clean without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied rhythms, high information density, and metaphor that generally clarifies rather than obscures (“memories snagged on hers like burrs on cloth” is exemplary). The prose leans lush but rarely tips into purple; figurative language is patterned and coherent with the dream/engineering motif. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding lines, and each sentence does multiple jobs (world-building, character, and mood). A few abstract terms (“profound transformation”) are offset by concrete follow-through, so momentum stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, often doing double work of worldbuilding and characterizing Ilya’s mind. Figurative language is original yet legible, with few if any mixed metaphors or purple stretches, and almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The prose maintains momentum even while being lush, and action ordering remains clear despite the surreal physics. Final sentences land crisply, recharging earlier motifs without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush but generally efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, character, theme) without lapsing into synonym churn or redundancy. Figurative language is coherent and motif-driven (cracks as grief, birds as rests, wire as held breath), and there are few if any mixed metaphors or scaffolding sentences. Some lines edge toward overt explanation (“records of pressure endured,” “nobody is unheard if someone keeps moving toward them”), which slightly softens the otherwise immaculate subtlety. Overall, line-level craft is publication-ready with only minimal tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is graceful and information-dense, often doing double duty (advancing plot while deepening atmosphere and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple clutter; rhythms vary enough to keep the paragraphs from feeling mechanically patterned. Sentences like “as if the earth rehearsed a secret dance for anyone patient enough to watch” balance precision with image in a way that feels crafted rather than overstuffed. A few long, similarly cadenced lines could be tightened for breath and impact, but they don’t materially obscure causality or dull the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush yet mostly efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“a small orchestra waiting for a cue” establishes both tools and his theatrical sensibility). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern-consistent, rarely tipping into muddle or redundancy. A few lines verge on purple or expository (“His peace was not a pose but a practice”), but they don’t significantly sap momentum or obscure causality. Rhythm and sentence variety hold up under read-aloud scrutiny, and the closing cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, character, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is mostly fresh and coherent, grounded in water, rot, and scent; the occasional flourish (“wave of graves and ripe pears”) still serves immediate experience. Momentum holds throughout despite lyricism; there are no clarity-breaking metaphors or syntactic stumbles. A slight tendency toward abstraction (“undercurrent of wisdom”) keeps it just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but controlled: nearly every sentence does double duty in building world, mood, and stakes without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is rich yet legible, with few if any mixed metaphors; images such as roots lifting “like pale fingers” and channels as “glass ladders” are precise and coherent. Rhythm varies well between long, flowing descriptions and sharper, focused moments as she enters the hollow, keeping momentum strong despite a mainly interior conflict. A marginal trim of modifiers in a couple of sentences could further heighten punch, but line-level craft is already at a near-publishable standard.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but purposeful, with high information content per line and very few redundancies; images like “paused recording” and “air behaved like a liquid” are clear and apt rather than overwrought. Sentence rhythm varies well between long, layered descriptions and more clipped action sequences, sustaining momentum without confusion. Figurative language remains coherent and thematically aligned (silence as engineered absence, wind as circuitry) and does not tangle into mixed metaphors. I see no significant scaffold, repetition, or syntactic artifacts that would obscure cause/effect or dull the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush, image-dense, and largely precise; many sentences accomplish multiple tasks (worldbuilding, emotion, and action) without bloat. Metaphors like “silence so thick it seems carved” or the amber sheet “like resin swallowing fireflies” are vivid and coherent with the story’s material palette. There is a borderline saturation of simile/metaphor, particularly in the opening, that risks purple-tinge but does not derail clarity or momentum. Line-level redundancy and scaffolding are minimal, and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense yet efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“She had not come for forgiveness but for understanding” is both motive and tonal calibration). Imagery is mostly sharp and original, and repetition (“avalanchingly quiet,” the hush deepening) feels patterned rather than accidental. There are no significant scaffold or synonym loops, and syntax varies enough to maintain rhythm. A few metaphors approach saturation, but they remain coherent and do not obscure action or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and metaphors that remain coherent within a few closely-related domains (letterpress, astronomy, mathematics). Sentences vary in length and structure, giving the piece a supple read-aloud rhythm. Despite the density of figurative language, it rarely tips into muddle or redundancy, and key beats (the first empathy swap, the final blank broadside) are rendered with clarity. If anything, a tiny reduction in metaphor count at one or two peak moments might sharpen impact further, but it doesn’t materially harm closure here.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and frequently do double duty by advancing plot and theme through image (e.g., “the way thaw finds a crack in stone”). Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to muddy clarity, and key beats—the pendant vibrating, the vision of Nera, the final chalked question—remain crisp. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; almost every line earns its place. A few sentences verge on lush, but they support atmosphere rather than stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, and concept) without obvious redundancy or scaffold, and the rhythm varies to maintain momentum. Figurative language (“like water in stone,” “light from the prism crawled along the frost lines”) is vivid and coherent, supporting the world’s slightly uncanny physics without muddle. There’s no noticeable loop, template cadence, or over-explanation; the density feels intentional and legible throughout. A few lines edge toward abstraction, but they’re anchored quickly back into concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and forward motion) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically tied to weaving, mapping, and silence, avoiding mixed metaphors that would blur sense. Syntax varies enough to keep the ear engaged, and key beats (the loom restarting, the loss of voice, Jun’s return) are rendered in clear, concrete images. At times the density of modifiers leans toward purple, but it never obscures causality or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense yet controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“where he knew he had lost something but could not name it, like a fruit you taste only after it is gone”). Figurative language is generally fresh and coherent with the world’s textures (fruit, stone, silk, air), and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding lines. Momentum is maintained despite lyricism; each paragraph adds new pressure, information, or turn. A couple of metaphors verge on being slightly showy, but they do not materially obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with vivid metaphors (“my palms already reading the grit and oil like braille”) that both characterize and advance the scene. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and there’s little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or mechanical patterning. Figurative language stays coherent with the story’s physical and emotional logic, never tangling the action. Momentum is sustained throughout, with description, interiority, and plot work often carried in the same line.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, stakes) with minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; metaphors like “a lighthouse in darkness had a different sound, like a throat refusing to sing” are vivid and precise. There’s little to no synonym churn, template cadence, or explanatory redundancy slowing momentum. The closing paragraphs, in particular, balance clarity of action with charged imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense yet purposeful: nearly every line carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, character, theme) without redundancy or muddled metaphor. Extended images—laughter as weather, light as a river in glass, newspapers as “ancient shadows”—stay internally consistent and build on one another. There’s no evident scaffold, synonym churn, or template cadence; the narrative moves forward cleanly even in reflective moments. The closing paragraphs land with clarity and rhythm, giving a charged, memorable cadence to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty for image and character, and figurative language is coherent and thematically aligned (light, dye, scars, stories as stains). There are no evident loops, scaffolding, or syntactic templates; rhythm varies enough to keep momentum through a largely contemplative piece. While the language brushes up against purple at times, it remains clear and never muddies causality or the closure image. Opening and closing lines are strong anchors that reframe prior motifs without resorting to flat summary.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but highly efficient, with most sentences doing double duty in worldbuilding and emotional shading, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is vivid yet controlled; metaphors (e.g., windows as “sheets of moving ink,” the sextant’s healing “the way some cuts close when you stop picking them”) are coherent and character-appropriate. Rhythm varies well, and the long, sinuous sentences fit the contemplative, accumulative mode without obscuring causality or the closure image. I see no material loops, muddled metaphors, or register slips that would drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but purposeful: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and grounded in the story’s own logic; images like beads from a snapped thread, dawn woven into cloth, and night tightening “like a collar” are precise. There are a few moments where metaphors stack or the syntax lengthens in ways that slightly blur tempo in what should be high-pressure beats, yet clarity at closure remains intact. No major loops, template cadences, or copy-level errors interfere with momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density and images that generally do double duty (e.g., lamplight “pooled like honey” suggests warmth and slowness). Sentences vary in length and structure, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. The main weakness is a slight tendency toward aphoristic abstraction in climactic lines, which can feel a touch programmatic rather than organically spoken from pressure. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained throughout, and no figurative muddle or loops undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is highly polished: sentences vary in rhythm and structure, images are sharp without becoming purple, and nearly every line advances character, world, or theme. Figurative language (“her voice heuristically gentle,” “small green arguments against forgetting”) is fresh and integrated, with no evident mixed metaphors or redundancy loops. The pacing breathes appropriately around key beats (invitation, confession, planting, final bow) without bogging down in exposition. There are no noticeable syntax, grammar, or clarity slips, and the final sentence lands with clean, distilled force.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but mostly high-yield: lines typically carry atmosphere, worldbuilding, and emotional weight simultaneously (e.g., “counting the tremble in their light the way one counts a heartbeat”). Figurative language is frequent yet controlled; images of ice, glass, light, and breath interlock rather than clash, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences. Rhythm modulates well between long, flowing sentences and tighter ones that land key realizations. The lushness comes close to saturation in a couple of spots, but it doesn’t obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is dense yet controlled: images like “lanterns rocked like tired fireflies” and “thunder through a bedpost” are vivid and apt, not piled up for their own sake. There’s minimal redundancy; almost every line advances setting, character, or pressure simultaneously. Rhythm modulates well, and the prose remains lucid even at high descriptive intensity. A tiny fraction of metaphors border on richness-for-its-own-sake, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, dense but purposeful imagery, and lines that typically do two or three jobs at once (worldbuilding, mood, and character). The prose occasionally approaches the edge of lushness, but the metaphors stay coherent and voice-true rather than purple or muddy, and there’s little to no scaffolding or repetition. Information flows smoothly without clogging the momentum, and the final sentence lands with clarity and weight. Minor risk: some readers may feel figurative density in early lines (“history trying to remember itself”) verges on saturation, but it doesn’t obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, and plot), the rhythm varies, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful (“auroral sorrow,” “bottles of dawn”), and action sequencing is clear even inside lyric passages. A few metaphors border on density/purple (“as if the crystals remember brighter colors they can no longer throw across the sky”), risking slight over-saturation. Minor tightening of explanatory clauses around the mother’s intent would sharpen momentum without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense but generally precise; most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“paper scraps floated like jellyfish,” words composted into air) is inventive and rarely muddled, and syntax remains clear even at high density. There is a mild risk of over-ornamentation in places, where nearly every sentence carries an image, but it doesn’t significantly slow momentum or obscure causality. Line-level control in the closing beats is especially strong, with the last paragraph crisply recharging earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is dense but generally precise; almost every sentence does multiple jobs—worldbuilding, image, and thematic charge—without significant redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent yet controlled, and metaphors are coherent and grounded in the story’s material palette (bells, wind, light, ice). There is a mild risk of overrichness—nearly every beat is adorned, which can slightly blunt momentum—but clarity of cause/effect and closure is never obscured. Syntax is varied and clean, with no noticeable grammatical slips or confusing constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with minimal scaffolding, and there’s notable rhythmic variety. Imagery is fresh and controlled—“an unplugged storm,” fears as a bead, chest plating with “organic grain”—without descending into muddled or mixed metaphors, even under pressure. There are no obvious loops or synonym churn; almost every line advances situation, stakes, or emotional texture. The slight limit is a consistent high-density lyricism that, in a few spots, risks slowing momentum where a sparer sentence might hit harder, which keeps it a hair below the topmost tier.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, character) without bloat, and figurative language like “voices braid together like windblown sand” supports motif rather than obscuring sense. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and transitions between beats are clean and fluid. The closing movement maintains clarity while achieving a lyrical lift, with no muddled metaphors or cadence loops that blunt the final image. A bit of trimming of explicit thematic phrasing could make the prose even tauter, but the current state is near-publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but purposeful: most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously), and imagery stays coherent and thematically linked to water, webs, and code. There are no evident synonym loops or scaffold sentences; momentum is maintained despite the lyricism. Metaphors are frequent but not chaotic, and they track with the story’s logic rather than calling attention to themselves as ornament. A hair more variation between high-tension, clipped syntax and slower, lush description could sharpen dynamic range, but line-level craft is already near-publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is tight, image-rich, and high in information density; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, worldbuilding, or stakes. Figurative language is frequent but not purple, and the metaphors mostly cohere within a salt/light/sea vocabulary without muddling sense. There are no evident loops, scaffold sentences, or syntactic templates dulling momentum, and the opening and closing lines are especially strong. At times the density of description in mid-paragraphs risks slight saturation, but it does not materially impede clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is dense but disciplined: most sentences do double duty in worldbuilding and theme, and figurative language is coherent and on-concept. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding; momentum is steady despite the contemplative tone. Occasional lush phrases flirt with purple but remain grounded in action or perception, especially around the magic. The closing cadence is particularly strong, landing on precise, image-driven language.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, compressed, and imagistically rich, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information (“meteors stitched white seams…like the sky was being repaired”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled; images rarely clash, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the narrative flows cleanly from beat to beat without syntactic confusion. At times the density of metaphor approaches purple, which slightly risks overshadowing emotional immediacy, but it never seriously obscures sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is rich and often does double duty, marrying worldbuilding with emotional texture; images like “jars tuned to a different frequency of grief” are both vivid and conceptually apt. Sentence rhythm varies well, and the piece avoids obvious loops or scaffolding. There is a mild risk of over-density in clustered metaphors (“tragically radiant,” “light quarantined,” “petals drinking the sky”), but clarity and momentum remain intact through the climactic beats. The line level is strong enough for a high-end market, though a small trim of ornamental description would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is strong, rhythmic, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and plot (“the scent of crushed petals…breaking Senn’s practiced rhythm”). There are no notable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic glitches; action order remains clear despite compression. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, flirting with purple in places and slightly over-texturing moments that might benefit from sharper, plainer contrast. Line-level craft is publishable and distinctive but could be tightened marginally for maximum impact in a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is densely imagistic yet remarkably clean: most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, and action) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is vivid but coherent and thematically aligned with sound and resonance, avoiding mixed metaphors even under peak pressure in the chamber scene. Syntax varies enough to keep a strong read-aloud rhythm, and there’s little to no filler; almost every line advances setting, stakes, or emotional charge. At an elite-publication standard one might trim a handful of modifiers, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, character, and theme) with minimal redundancy, and rhythm shifts gracefully between long, sinuous description and tighter explanatory moves. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent, and key metaphors (windows, lenses, breath in cold air) recur with deliberate pattern rather than in a muddled pile. A few lines verge on density that could risk purple in a longer piece, but here they mostly enhance rather than obscure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense with imagery (“clouds left the moon in shreds,” “air was scintillatingly somber”) yet generally avoids muddle or mixed metaphors; most lines do multiple jobs (setting, character, and theme) without feeling padded. Sentence rhythm varies and momentum carries smoothly from atmosphere into instruction and then into the small investigative climax. There are no noticeable paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; almost every line advances either the emotional arc or the pattern motif. The only minor limitation is that figurative language is frequent enough that a few images feel ornamental rather than strictly pressured by scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is lean yet evocative, with high information density—most sentences advance both world and character (“sentences reappeared like bones under sand”). Figurative language is original but not overstacked, and there is minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Syntax varies nicely, and momentum carries cleanly through description-heavy portions without drag. Line-level clarity is high; no metaphoric muddle or template cadence undermines the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is dense and multi-functional: most sentences carry worldbuilding, character, and mood simultaneously, and the rhythm varies effectively between long, sinuous lines and tighter beats. Figurative language is frequent but rarely mixed or confused, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few metaphors push toward purple, and compression occasionally leaves emotional beats under-voiced, but clarity and momentum are largely maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: figurative language (“lonesome splendor,” jars like lanterns, coins as “receipts of belonging”) generally does multiple jobs without sliding into muddle. Sentence-to-sentence momentum is strong, with little scaffold or synonym-churn; nearly every line advances image, character, or thematic charge. The musical repetitions (dawn’s whistle, hiss of tide, jars, melody) feel patterned rather than accidental. It’s lush enough that one more layer of ornament might have tipped into purple, but as is, clarity and cadence remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush but generally precise, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing plot, deepening character, and reinforcing motif simultaneously. Figurative language is vivid (“salt loosens a knot,” “blood into bandage”) and thematically aligned with the sonic and maritime frame, rarely tipping into muddle. There is little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn; momentum holds despite the lyricism. A few compounded images lightly flirt with purple, but they don’t obstruct clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but generally precise, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding, character, and theme (“even machines had tides” is exemplary). Rhythm and imagery are controlled; repetition is pattern, not artifact, and there’s little in the way of scaffolding or synonym churn. Metaphoric language is mostly coherent and integrated with the world’s logic (ice, moon, magnetism), avoiding purple excess. A handful of long, multi-clause sentences could be fractionally tightened around the heist sequence, but they don’t materially obscure action or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs—advancing plot, deepening character, and sharpening atmosphere—without scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language (e.g., echoes as “testimony after cross-examination,” his voice “like oil”) is vivid and thematically apt without sliding into purple. The piece sustains a high density of image and concept with good clarity; I don’t see loops, template cadences, or filter-verb stacks that drag momentum. A few sentences are long and layered, but they remain parseable and purposeful under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and metaphors that are coherent and thematically aligned (“as though it knew it did not deserve to run until someone chose to be responsible”). There’s some lushness, but figurative language rarely stacks to the point of blur, and almost every line advances character, world, or theme. Redundancy is minimal; the few repeated motifs (light, hush, deliberateness) are purposeful. Grammar and sequencing are clean, keeping momentum through reflection-heavy passages.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line the prose is dense, inventive, and efficient: most sentences do double duty with image and concept, and there is little evident scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Metaphors are fresh and sharply chosen (e.g., “a toy that turned light into disciplined chaos,” “a silence that felt crowded”) and rarely feel mixed or overextended. Momentum is maintained despite the lyricism; exposition is folded into action and perception rather than delivered as info-dumps. There is a slight risk of overload as figurative language is frequent even in higher-pressure beats, but clarity and closure remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, specific, and musical without tipping into purple; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is varied and coherent, and there are no noticeable repetition loops or scaffolding phrases. Rhythm shifts appropriately—from long, echoing sentences in reflective moments to tighter clauses during investigative turns—creating propulsion. The final sentence elegantly braids numbers, families, and archive into a resonant close.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: nearly every sentence does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and stake) without visible scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is vivid yet controlled, with no mixed metaphors or muddled images, and there’s a pleasing cadence across the long, flowing sentences. There is minimal redundancy and no mechanical template cadence; rhythm supports the reflective yet pressured atmosphere. Line-level craft is at or near publishable quality for a high-end market.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, and theme), and the rhythm varies in ways that support mood. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, rarely feeling purple or redundant (“engine coughed like a patient deciding to stay alive one more hour” is a standout). There are no meaningful loops or scaffolding sentences, and clarity of action remains intact even during the storm. The only minor risk is density—nearly every line is metaphor-charged—but it doesn’t significantly impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is graceful and rhythmically controlled, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“amber pavilion…glowing like a held breath” is a good example). Metaphor density is high but mostly coherent and character-situated (grafting, corks, sap), and sentences vary in length enough to avoid monotony. There are no evident loops, scaffolding, or syntactic confusions; the reading experience is smooth. The accumulation of figurative language occasionally skirts purple, which slightly reduces sharpness in a few beats.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: high information density, almost every sentence carrying worldbuilding, mood, and character at once. Metaphors (“like ribs under skin,” “paced the pavilion ropes like a thought”) are fresh and coherent, and figurative language does not muddy causality. There are no evident scaffolding loops or clunky exposition; the prose moves with quiet propulsion appropriate to the tone. A couple of conceptual phrases (“conjured clearings,” “measured kindness”) lean abstract but are quickly grounded in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is strong and information-dense: most sentences do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and meaning (“a bad riddle with no answer, except for the lavender field…” is a good example). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, with motifs (arcs, maps, doors) reinforcing the design rather than cluttering it. There are minor risks of over-lyricism and a few sentences that edge toward abstraction, but they don’t materially blur sense or slow momentum. The cadence into the final paragraph is especially well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is consistently elegant, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding (“the windows still held night like ink,” “paper skins, shedding silently into compost”). Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous lines and tighter, declarative moments, especially near structural pivots (“Sequence one:” “Sequence two:” etc.). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically tuned; there’s little in the way of redundancy or scaffold, and syntax remains lucid despite lyricism. A few abstractions (“era of unprinted definitions,” “pattern of growth was a code for paths”) skate close to exposition, but they usually stay anchored in image, keeping momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and image-rich, yet sentences generally do multiple jobs—advancing setting, emotion, and theme at once—and avoid obvious loops or scaffolding. Metaphors are coherent and patterned (fog, rust, tape, tide) rather than piled-on at random, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. At times the line-level texture is almost too consistently ornate, but clarity and closure are never obscured, so it reads as high-level lyricism rather than purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is dense but controlled: metaphors (“hand…like a trapped comet,” “bright as a scar”) are vivid and thematically aligned with celestial mechanics and damage. Sentences generally do multiple jobs (world, mood, and stakes) without scaffolding repetition, and momentum is sustained even through reflective beats. There’s mild risk of purple prose in a few stacked images, but clarity and propulsion never suffer, and the closure image is sharp. No notable loops, filter-verb stacks, or syntactic monotony appear.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and the rhythm modulating well between action and reflection. Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined and pattern-consistent, supporting the music/heartbeat/cloud motifs. There are minor lapses into slightly purple or redundant phrasing (e.g., hope described multiple times in similar citrus/garden terms) that could be pared without loss. Nonetheless, line-level craft remains strong and never obscures causality or dulls the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, imaginative, and purposeful; nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and plot) without evident scaffolding or repetition. The figurative language is inventive but coherent—spoons bending reality, noon snapping into circles, light stored under glass—and it does not pile into muddled metaphor chains. Rhythm varies naturally, with long sinuous sentences balanced by shorter, grounding clauses, and the closure image is clear and strong. At this level of scrutiny, the only constraint is that density is uniformly high, which works here but leaves little modulation between contemplative and high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, dense without feeling purple, and most sentences do multiple jobs—advancing plot, sketching character, and charging imagery at once. Recurring phrases (“shrewdly innocent,” “substitute body,” “maze”) are deliberate motifs rather than sloppy loops. There are no significant clarity issues or overwritten metaphors that blunt impact; line-level control actually heightens the story’s mood and thematic weave. The only minor drawback is that a few sentences edge toward lushness in reflective passages, but they don’t stall momentum or obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, dense, and musical, with high information content per line and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally clear and earned, and it rarely muddies causality or image; phrases like “reflectively vibrant” recur but function as meaningful leitmotifs rather than empty ornament. Sentence rhythm varies, and paragraphs each move character, setting, or theme forward. It edges toward lushness, but not enough to impair momentum or the clarity of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are mostly precise, and there’s little to no scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; motifs (honey, moss, data) are coherently threaded rather than stacked at random. Phrases like “honeyed hush that softened my ribs” risk edging toward purple but are grounded by tactile detail and narrative function. Minor tightening could further heighten momentum, yet as-is the prose easily meets high-market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are economical for such a metaphor-dense piece, with most images doing double duty for setting and theme. The metaphoric system is internally consistent (currents, chapters, ink, bread) and avoids mixed or incoherent vehicles. There is no evident scaffolding, synonym churn, or repetitive cadence that drags momentum, and the final lines land cleanly. A few phrases flirt with purple, but they stay legible and do not muddy cause or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush with metaphor and personification, yet on the whole it maintains clarity and multi-functionality—most sentences advance both atmosphere and narrative. There is some risk of saturation (“drawing damp moonlight,” “sap rose like applause,” “harp from a dream”), but the imagery remains coherent and avoids mixed metaphors or repetitive scaffolding. Momentum is preserved through syntactic variety and clean sequencing of actions; there are no obvious loops or filler sentences. It’s polished, publishable language, just shy of the razor-edged restraint that would push it into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense with information and image without obvious scaffold, repetition, or clarity loss, and nearly every line deepens either world, character, or theme. Figurative language—“branches fixed mid-shiver,” “aurora… loosened and moved a fraction”—is fresh and internally coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. Rhythm shows good variation, with long, flowing constructions for ritual and short declaratives for key turns (“She did not trust numbers alone”). The only minor limitation is that the high figurative density rarely lets the prose breathe, which may slightly soften the impact of individual images in such a brief space.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, often doing double duty (worldbuilding and character at once) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and well-matched to the motif of reflection and resonance; phrases like “store wonder in the cellar of reason” and “harvest of echoes” feel unified rather than ornamental. Sentences vary in length and structure, keeping the rhythm from becoming numbing despite the lyric density. A faint risk of over-ornamentation in spots prevents a move into the very highest band, but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but controlled: metaphors are extended rather than stacked at random, and most sentences do more than one job (worldbuilding, emotion, theme at once). Rhythm and sentence openings vary, and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every line advances atmosphere or concept. The figurative language approaches the edge of purple in a few spots, but physical logic and image systems remain coherent, so clarity is not sacrificed. The final images (whalebone frame, soot-marked palms, stars settling into the body) land cleanly without being smothered by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and musical, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density—most lines do double duty for mood, character, and world. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent; images of cats, cages, circles, rust, and time recur in deliberate patterns rather than as decorative clutter. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or clarity breaks; grammar and sequencing are clean. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the lushness hovers near the edge of purple in a few places, though it never quite tips over.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is densely figurative but controlled; images like “clouds rub their bellies against the struts” and “water looping in deliberate spirals that click like gears and never spill” are vivid, coherent, and thematically aligned. Sentences generally do multiple jobs at once—worldbuilding, mood, and character interiority—without falling into redundancy or scaffold. There are no noticeable loops, mixed metaphors, or register slips that impede clarity, and the high-pressure beats (the negotiation, the trade of images, the final repair) remain lucid despite their lyricism. Line-level rhythm supports momentum, with paragraph breaks and syntactic variation marking meaningful emotional and narrative shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense yet efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“the building held them like stale air in sealed ducts,” “the first trickle…sounded like a small animal returning to a burrow”). Figurative language is generally fresh and coherent, and rhythm varies well across descriptive and action beats. There is little scaffolding or redundancy; exposition is woven into tactile action (reading diagrams while planning flows). At a demanding-editor level, a few metaphors push toward richness-for-its-own-sake, but they do not obscure meaning or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: metaphors (e.g., “a bell that refuses to ring”) are consistent with the established sound/time motif and do not tangle. Sentences typically do multiple jobs—advancing setting, emotion, and theme at once—without paraphrase loops or scaffolding. Rhythm varies nicely, and there is no noticeable template cadence or filter-verb stacking that dulls immediacy. The closing lines are clean and precise, recharging earlier images without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level writing is strong, with high information density—most sentences multitask by carrying setting, theme, and character. The figurative language generally holds together and serves the central metaphors of architecture and light; phrases like “the lie was built like a bridge, plank by plank” are vivid and apt. There is mild risk of over-ornamentation (several long, clause-stacked sentences and repeated constructions like “serene upheaval” and “thoughtfully clear”) but clarity and momentum remain intact, especially around pivotal beats. I see little to no scaffolding repetition or syntactic templating that would need cutting prior to publication.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, densely informative, and almost all do double duty for atmosphere and action. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and thematically aligned (language, memory, cycles); it rarely feels like decorative churn. There’s no evident looping or scaffold, and the climactic beats (bowline/name reveal, seed placement) are rendered cleanly and precisely. It stops short of the very top band only because the prose leans heavily into the same lyrical register throughout, with few moments of stark, pared-back contrast under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is rich, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (e.g., “a loom remembering the tension of weaving grief into pattern”). Syntax varies, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase-looping; each sentence tends to move character or atmosphere. Figurative density is high but generally coherent and controlled, rarely feeling like purple excess. A few metaphors (“lonesome splendor,” “my ribs were a railing”) skate close to ornament, but they don’t obscure sense or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and musical, with many doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization (“sugar burnt on a blade” encapsulates both sensory impression and emotional sting). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and apt; it rarely muddies meaning or cause/effect. There’s minimal scaffold or repetition, and information flows cleanly through the scene. At times the prose approaches purple, and a slight trimming of modifiers could heighten impact, but momentum and clarity remain intact through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-by-line craft is tight and purposeful; nearly every sentence does double duty for plot, character, and image. Metaphor density is high but controlled, with a coherent fire/skin/coin/sand lexicon and no noticeable mixed or clashing figures, even in peak beats. There is very little scaffold or repetition, and rhythm varies enough to carry momentum through reflection-heavy segments. The only minor check is that a few thematic statements edge toward aphorism, but they’re brief and grounded enough not to feel like purple moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is strong: high information density, varied syntax, and images that usually do double duty for atmosphere and theme. A few phrases flirt with purple or stacked metaphor, but they remain legible and consistent in register with the chosen mode. There’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony, and the sequence of actions is clear. Tightening one or two slightly ornamental images could push the prose toward true top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and imagistic, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“pollen” as violet dust, “gear carving grooves that glimmered without heat”). Figurative language is mostly fresh and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors and maintaining internal logic. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and transitions between beats are clean. A few lines flirt with purple excess, but they don’t materially obscure action or the closure image, so momentum remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) and the figurative language (“cut from moonlight,” “throbbed in him like calm thunder”) is both apt and controlled. There’s very little scaffolding or redundancy, and syntax varies enough to keep the ear engaged while supporting the meditative tone. The density of imagery is near the upper edge but rarely tips into muddle; the metaphors remain internally coherent and grounded. For absolute top-tier, one or two lines could be pared where modifiers stack slightly, but none of this harms clarity or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, mood, and plot) without redundancy, and metaphors rarely feel strained or mixed. Rhythm varies nicely between longer lyric lines and shorter, decisive actions (“She returned to the tower and restarted the swing”). There is minimal scaffold or repetition; each paragraph advances situation or emotional charge. A few phrases push toward intensity (“taking a hot coal from her own throat”), but they remain grounded in embodied sensation and do not blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is rich and precise, with most sentences doing multiple jobs of image, mood, and information (“The chess clock was their cover, because no one questions two men waiting on time, and the final silence meant the handoff was complete”). Figurative language is frequent but usually sharp and un-muddled; it enlarges rather than obscures sense. Line-level momentum remains strong with minimal redundancy, though a handful of metaphors and modifiers skirt the edge of “purple” in already dense moments.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is polished: long, flowing sentences are balanced by sharper turns; almost every line carries multiple functions (world, theme, character) without sludge. Figurative language is original yet controlled, with few if any mixed metaphors or redundancies, and rhythm holds up under reread. A couple of sentences verge on conceptual density, but clarity of action and thought remains intact, including at the closure beats. There is virtually no scaffolding or paraphrase looping, which sustains strong momentum for a reflective, idea-heavy piece.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for world, mood, and theme. Metaphors are frequent but coherent and motif-driven (dust, ember, static, glow), so the lyricism feels patterned rather than purple. There’s very little scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every line advances atmosphere or stakes. The density may brush against overload for some readers, but it doesn’t materially blur causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“like an unattended metronome marking time for mistakes”). Figurative density is high but not purple; metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (mirage, vanishing point, night sky of charcoal dust). There are no noticeable loops, filler scaffolding, or syntactic monotony, and rhythm modulates well between long, lush sentences and tighter, pressure-driven lines. A few images verge on luxuriant, but they never obscure causality or dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lean yet richly imagistic, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“green with age but sharp as a fresh decision” is an emblematic line). Syntax and paragraphing maintain momentum; there’s little scaffolding or repetition, and metaphors are coherent and thematically pointed rather than ornamental. The closing image of the cog turning in a crude rig clinches both narrative and conceptual threads without over-explaining. A slight density of metaphor in early lines keeps it from feeling utterly effortless, but there are no significant artifacts or clarity lapses.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are precise (“memos that arrived like dust on shelves,” “the library took on traveled stillness”) and most sentences do multiple jobs—advancing theme, setting, and character simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful rather than decorative; the rosette/air motif and the noise/subtraction metaphor in particular are well sustained. There is slight density that edges toward purple in places, but it does not obscure meaning or momentum. No notable loops or scaffolding undercut the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense and efficient: nearly every sentence does double duty in advancing character, world, and mood. Imagery (“three moons lined up like coins on black velvet”) is precise and coherent; metaphors are fresh and thematically apt without tipping into purple. There are no visible loops, filler scaffolding, or register drift, and the rhythm supports the gentle build of pressure. Line-level craft is at or near publish-ready quality as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense yet disciplined, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and story movement. Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent (nectar, bees, lightning) and rarely feels overwrought or confusing. There’s little to no scaffolding or repetition; rhythm varies and carries momentum smoothly into the climax. A few lines edge close to purple, but they don’t obscure sense or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but highly efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for image and idea; there’s very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent, yet metaphors are largely coherent with the world of scent, quiet, and domestic space, avoiding muddle even in peak beats. Momentum holds despite lyric richness, in part because transitions (e.g., from solo experiments to the blackout gathering) are compressed but clear. The only minor limitation for top-tier is that imagery is almost uniformly lush, with few deliberately plain lines to vary texture and let the heaviest moments breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rich, image-dense, and largely precise, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (algae “holding still like curtains,” fountains as throats). Syntax varies well, maintaining momentum through a complex interior and expository load without feeling baggy. There is a mild risk of purple at moments—metaphor chains like “stage dust,” “curtains,” “throat trying to speak” crowd close—but clarity remains intact and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Line-level craft is strong enough for elite consideration, though a ruthless copyedit could trim a few ornaments.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (world-building, character, and theme) without noticeable scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is fresh and coherent (e.g., the mason building “a proof in limestone”), and the density feels intentional rather than florid. Rhythm and paragraphing maintain momentum through an entirely interior conflict, and the final lines land cleanly without over-explaining. I see no meaningful artifacts, loops, or muddled metaphors that would dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense yet generally precise, with vivid metaphors that pull multiple duties (“streetlamp look drowned,” “letters… drifted up like seeds”). Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and nearly every line advances character, setting, or theme—there is little scaffolding or repetition. A few images stack toward the ornate (“saffron quiet reveries,” “crescent shells”) but the pattern is consistent enough to read as deliberate lyricism rather than purple drift. One or two slightly leaner beats in the middle could give the lushness a bit more contrast and punch.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and story; images like “rose syrup turned sour” or notes “suspended like insects in amber” feel precise rather than ornamental. Rhythm varies well across the piece, and there’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or mixed metaphor to bog down momentum. High-pressure beats (the thaw, the guards’ arrival) remain clear despite lyrical language, maintaining forward motion and causal legibility. A few lines verge on lush, but they consistently serve mood and theme, so they don’t read as purple.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and largely economical; metaphors are coherent and suit the mood (“cold rushed up his arm, not pain but appetite” is particularly strong). Sentences vary in structure and length, with minimal scaffolding or repetition, and nearly every line does multiple jobs (world, mood, character). There is some density of figurative language, but it’s pattern-consistent rather than purple or muddling, and momentum doesn’t stall. A slight pruning of adjectival weight in a few places could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are inventive and mostly non-redundant, with high information density and purposeful metaphor. There is a lot of figurative language, but it reads as a controlled stylistic choice rather than uncontrolled purple prose, and crucial beats (“the clasp drank the luminance instead of letting it linger”) remain lucid. Sentence and paragraph rhythms vary and propel the scene toward the booth and flash without noticeable scaffold or loops. A slight density of imagery in a few spots flirts with overripe, but it doesn’t obscure causality or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, tone, and action) with minimal redundancy, and metaphors are apt and thematically linked rather than piled for effect. The prose has strong musicality without tipping into purple; phrases like “sky began to bruise” or “the sea still held the day in its throat” feel fresh yet legible. Momentum is well-maintained despite density; reflection is tightly anchored to unfolding action. I see no significant loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle that interfere with clarity, including at the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and causality) with little waste, and the prose largely avoids repetition, scaffolding, or muddled metaphors. Figurative language is abundant but targeted and coherent with the shell/spiral/gate motif; it rarely feels overwrought or confusing. Scene progression is clear despite conceptual density, and key turns are carried by clean, concrete actions (“dust leaps from a narrow seam,” “rust flakes fall like burnt petals”). A slight tightening—paring one or two descriptive clauses that echo prior images—would move this into truly elite minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, dense with meaning, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding; images like “weeds rose through the tiles like slow smoke” carry both atmosphere and thematic weight. Sentence rhythm varies well and supports mood without drawing attention to itself. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to become purple or muddled, and syntax remains clear at pivotal beats. There’s little to no looped phrasing or filler, making the line-level craft publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are purposeful, often carrying multiple loads (setting, emotion, theme) without obvious redundancy, and metaphorical choices (“hushed blaze,” “silt boiling up like smoke”) are vivid yet coherent. There is a high density of figurative language, but it feels patterned rather than purple, with water, foundations, and light motifs interlocking cleanly. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and action sequencing remains clear even in more lyrical stretches. Minor tightening could trim a few near-echoes in phrasing, but no artifacts measurably blunt momentum or obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and rarely redundant, and images are fresh without tipping into purple. Figurative language (“the sunken city felt like a held breath”) is controlled and coherent, with no mixed metaphors or strained comparisons. There are no noticeable scaffold phrases or synonym loops dragging momentum. A handful of abstract formulations exist, but they are brief and anchored in concrete context so they don’t blur sense or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads—worldbuilding, mood, and emotional stance—without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but mostly precise and non-contradictory; images tend to be fresh and grounded in the story’s logic of light, glass, and paper. Syntax and diction are varied enough to avoid drumbeat patterns, and the last lines (“luminous torment made useful…”) successfully crystallize prior motifs. The only restraint on a higher score is that the metaphor saturation approaches a threshold where, in a longer piece, some pruning would be necessary; here it’s just within control.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-by-line, the prose is strong, with high information density and multifunctional sentences that build world, theme, and emotion simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, with images like “clouds rolled under us like bruises” and “laughter in a morgue” doing real work. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; the sentences generally push momentum rather than circling. The only constraint on a higher score is the sheer saturation of metaphor in a short span, which risks slight overload in high-pressure beats even though clarity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is excellent: high information density, vivid but coherent metaphors, and almost no redundant scaffolding. Sentences carry multiple jobs—world-building, mood, and character insight—without becoming opaque, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. The figurative language is frequent but patterned and thematically aligned (light, ink, type, stars, sound) rather than scattershot. There are no noticeable mechanical errors or loops, and both opening and final images are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong information density—most sentences do double duty in world-building and interiority. Figurative language is rich but not so stacked as to obscure sense; metaphors (bruised ink sea, fish-bone watch hand, sieved hush) are coherent and thematically unified. There is minimal redundancy and no obvious scaffold or template cadence, and the final sentences land cleanly on image and action. One could argue for slight over-ornamentation in places, but it does not noticeably drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but not overwrought, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character) without redundancy. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, especially in the recurring home/lock/handle imagery; there are no noticeable metaphor clashes or scaffold phrases. Rhythm and paragraphing keep momentum through what is essentially a talk-and-procedure scene, avoiding loops or summary repetition. The final lines land cleanly and precisely, recharging earlier motifs without extra explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lyrical yet controlled, with strong sentence-to-sentence propulsion and minimal redundancy; images like “like salt in a cut” and “utility poles…like wet pencils” are vivid and apt. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and multi-functional, building both atmosphere and psychology without devolving into purple abstraction. There are no evident scaffold sentences, loops, or mechanical cadences, and grammar/sequence remain clean. A few concept-heavy phrases (“the hour when expectations collapse,” “what he served”) flirt with abstraction, but they are anchored enough not to drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing plot, revealing character, and sustaining mood. Metaphors are generally sharp and coherent (“wonder…like a bruise you keep pressing,” “the lake shimmered like a jury”) without stacking into purple overload or obscuring action. There’s no obvious scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony, and momentum carries cleanly through summary and scene. A couple of lines verge on theme-telling, but they don’t materially bog the rhythm or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and often beautiful, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology (“her hands were scarred from gentling storms inside frightened throats” is exemplary). Metaphor use is frequent but generally coherent and thematically aligned; only occasionally does it flirt with excess without tipping into muddle. Sentences vary in structure, and there is little to no evident scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic templating that drags momentum. A touch more pruning in places could sharpen impact further, but line-level craft is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are musical yet controlled, with high information density and minimal redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but precise (“stair of condensed sighs,” “beauty choked me the way milk chokes a tired throat”) and rarely feels mixed or overwrought. Rhythm varies to match emotional intensity, and each sentence advances character, world, or thematic charge. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or clarity breaks even in the densest descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished and information-dense; nearly every sentence advances character, world, or theme, with minimal scaffolding or redundant phrasing. Extended metaphors of stitching, tears, and recycled metal are coherent and pattern-driven, not purple for its own sake, and they pay off in the closing image. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to keep momentum, and there are no noticeable line-level artifacts, clumsy constructions, or clarity breaks. If anything, one could very slightly trim a metaphor or two for even more tautness, but it does not meaningfully drag.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, dense with information, and most images do double duty for both atmosphere and theme (“ash sifted from the ceiling like gray pollen” is especially effective). There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase; nearly every sentence advances character, setting, or pressure. The figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and coherent, with only a couple of lines (“fate grew heavier with promise”) edging toward familiar or slightly purple. The final images are clear and impactful, with no artifacts or muddle blunting closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is vivid, dense, and mostly disciplined: many sentences do double-duty, advancing action while building atmosphere (“In the blackout we moved like ink across paper, trading keys, swapping orders, freeing wrists…”). Metaphoric language is frequent but usually coherent and on-theme (locks as mouths, tumblers as birds, the fort’s skin as a wink). There are a few points where image-stacking edges toward purple and could be trimmed for maximal impact, but there are no serious loops, muddled metaphors, or clarity failures. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to maintain momentum and readability.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentence-level craft is consistently strong: varied syntax, high information density, and metaphors that feel coherent with the world (sea as door, dust as moving map, eel turns as prayer). Figurative language is rich but not overstacked to the point of muddle, and there are no obvious loops or synonym churn; nearly every line adds either world-building, emotional shading, or forward motion. The rhythm modulates well between descriptive calm and higher-pressure ritual moments. No significant grammatical or clarity issues interfere with closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (image, emotion, and theme) with minimal redundancy, and the rhythm varies effectively across the piece. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; metaphors like the half-caught star as “a wound that refused to close” are apt and grounded in established imagery. There’s a mild risk of density bordering on ornate, yet clarity and narrative momentum remain intact through the climax and closure. I see no significant loops or scaffolding that would need cutting for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often do double duty for character and world (“steal maps and sell them as policy”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with few if any mixed metaphors or redundancies, and rhythm supports the shift from contemplative puzzle-solving to duel. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line advances pressure or texture. A demanding editor might trim a handful of modifiers for even tighter propulsion, but the prose is already publication-grade.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences are dense but purposeful, and most carry multiple functions (characterization, atmosphere, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent yet remarkably coherent, with recurring motifs (light cracking, fracture, seeds, rust) rather than scattershot metaphors. Rhythm varies nicely between long, flowing lyric sentences and shorter declaratives that land key turns (“until the place felt less like ruin”). The only minor drawback is that the sustained metaphorical register can verge on saturation, which might slightly blunt impact for some readers but doesn’t obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, character) with few redundancies, and the rhythm varies enough to sustain momentum in a lyric mode. Imagery is dense but controlled, with extended metaphors (time as schedule, film as map, station as ship) holding together rather than clashing. There are no obvious scaffold sentences, syntactic loops, or figurative muddles that blur the climax; the closing beats are clear and clean. The only restraint on a higher score is that metaphorical texture is nearly continuous, risking saturation in a couple of spots without real damage.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is consistently strong: sentences are information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and character, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent (“air tasted of salt and unspoken names,” “ground trembled…like laughter held too long”), and the line-level flow supports rather than obscures causality. There are no noticeable syntax glitches, loops, or clarity breaks at the climax. The only restraint on a higher score is that the sustained lushness borders on overrich in places, leaving little room for contrast or sparer moments that might sharpen key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is highly polished: most sentences do double duty for mood and meaning, and rhythm alternates effectively between long, lush lines and sharper beats at turning points (“I pruned one brittle twig…”). Figurative language is dense but not incoherent; imagery remains internally consistent with the sea/wood/cloth axis. There is a slight risk of saturation—almost every sentence is worked, which can blur contrast and forward drive—but clarity is never lost, including at the closure beat. Some micro-tightening of modifiers could increase impact without changing content.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic ("worried it down, plank by plank"), with high information density and no scaffold loops. The metaphors are purposeful, though "leaves... exhaling a small apology" borders on the precious.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and dense with strong imagery ("numbers half eaten by heat," "hum like a held note"). The rhythm is controlled, avoiding mechanical loops, though the thematic keywords are repeated to the point of redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is polished and lyrical, with evocative imagery like "missing tooth" and "painting heat." The rhythm is strong, though some functional shorthand ("Orren understood the method at once") bypasses the opportunity to dramatize the character's cognitive process, rushing the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in every line ("stone arches lean like drowned ribs"). The recurring motif of "chased stillness" is handled with rhythmic precision, evolving from an atmospheric threat to a pacified companion at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high-density lines like "magic was fear turning into care" that advance character and theme simultaneously. Imagery is precise ("soft as a spoon on glass") and the text is free of loop artifacts or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("river exhaled fog," "footprints fill with rain"). While some phrases lean toward the sentimental ("tasted salt and compassion"), the line-level craft is high quality, with no significant loops or artifacts disrupting the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("ribs," "tremor of green") with strong rhythmic control. While the required phrase "retrocognitively trapped" is slightly jarring against the organic lexicon, its repetition effectively links the caretaker's symptom to the root cause, serving the narrative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative density obstructs immediacy; similes ("like a curtain," "like a vow," "like falling ash") cluster tightly, and abstract metaphors ("thunder learning its name," "smells of tin and hope") drift into purple prose that dulls the action.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density in lines like "metals she salvaged needed memory in them." Rhythm and cadence are controlled, supporting the atmospheric tension. No significant artifacts or loops, though the poetic register remains high throughout, risking slight saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is lush and evocative, but the verbatim repetition of the complex phrase "luminous disbelief" (once in the middle, once in the final sentence) creates a distracting lexical loop. The recurrence flattens the emotional impact of the closure by recycling a descriptor rather than finding a fresh image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without sacrificing momentum. Images like "corridor tiles sighed" and "pale lanterns" serve the drive lens well. The text avoids scaffold and maintains a strong rhythmic pulse throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally evocative and dense, with striking imagery ("studio's mirrors looked like traps"). However, occasional overwriting appears in personified emotions ("certainty that trembled in my chest said"), and the mechanics of the final image ("projected... like subtitles") are confusingly phrased, blurring the line between metaphor and literal action.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("shedding glitter into my pockets"), though occasionally the metaphor density threatens to turn purple ("sweating salt and thunder"). The required phrase "mildly obsessed" sits awkwardly against the high-stakes context, a minor ripple in an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and image-rich ("thin line of light," "trapped air bubbles like paused breath") with zero scaffolding or synonym churn. The text achieves high information density while maintaining a smooth, propulsive cadence that matches the protagonist's meticulous nature.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and lyrical, with high information density in the descriptions of the tickets and the lens. There are minor instances of "writerly" abstraction (e.g., "borrowed from breath," "ambiguously clear") that distance the reader slightly from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly evocative, with images like fractures catching the sun "like spider silk" doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Sentence structures vary effectively to match the pacing of the ritual, and there is zero scaffold or wasted motion.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high density and evocative imagery ("lung holding its breath," "sipping the last purple light"). The rhythm supports the tension well, though the score is capped by the global gate linking high-band excellence to Q2 closure strength.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is lush and evocative, with high information density ("taken the river into its ribs"). While generally effective, the reliance on simile constructions ("like a nervous bow stroke," "like wrecked ships," "like the moment before") becomes slightly repetitive, creating a cadence that occasionally draws attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and image-rich ("graphite became fog," "hinge the night swung on"). It creates a strong atmosphere, though the density of figurative language borders on saturation in the opening lines; however, the precision prevents it from becoming purple.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic ("confession dropped... like a bolt"), maintaining strong momentum throughout. While most imagery is evocative, the description of eyelids that "click" strains the metaphor slightly, though it fits the heightened sensory state.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and dense with imagery ("paper softened into loam," "night made architectural"), effectively establishing the tone. While evocative, the metaphor density occasionally slows the reading pace, and a few phrases ("tasted of... black glass") border on abstraction. Generally, the line-level craft is high, with no distracting scaffold loops.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished but marred by the visible insertion of prompt phrases as labels ("softly adaptive," "cautious exuberance") which disrupts the natural flow. Some imagery is standard ("room without walls"), and the final paragraph dissolves into abstract summary rather than concrete action. There are no major mechanical errors, but the "prompt-stuffing" creates texture artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense with sensory imagery ("smelling of cedar and panic," "bronze dust"), creating a strong texture. However, some sentence structures rely on telling or scaffolding ("Her work was not to...", "because she was sensitively perceptive") which dampens the immediacy of the otherwise strong show-don't-tell moments.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("universe kept checking her spelling," "cooling conveyor tick like a metronome"). A minor precision issue arises with the "microdot specs" usage (conflating the object with a cipher method), but the overall line-level craft is exceptional and rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and striking imagery ("air felt like a cloth over a bell"). Syntax mimics the looping nature of the magic without becoming repetitive. Score capped at 8.8 due to the Q2 global gate.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic control ("cooling cookies," "sludge," "pale and deliberate"). Imagery like the paper quivering "as if a bow had touched a string" serves the central musical metaphor precisely without feeling decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and propulsive, handling complex temporal mechanics with economy. Phrasing like "darkening brightness" and "cuts that had healed into symbols" shows strong control of imagery. The text avoids scaffold and maintains high information density, though the climax leans slightly on abstract summation.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, with sentence structures that mimic the musicality of the subject matter. Imagery is distinct and avoids cliché ("drifts like gray pollen"). There is a slight overuse of the word "hush" and "numbness" within the short word count, creating minor lexical redundancy, but the line-level density is otherwise high and propels the story forward effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density in every sentence. Phrases like "stomach measured it as fraud" show excellent character-voice integration. There are no significant loops or artifacts; the rhythm supports the tension, particularly in the description of the courtyard silence.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in images like "crystal shadows" and "green tongues." A few phrasings, such as using "ultraviolet revealing" as a noun twice, read as slightly awkward artifacts, but the overall craft is polished.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is rhythmically strong and information-dense ("tasted of childhood dust"), supporting the magical realism tone. A few similes ("hummed like tuning forks," "laughing like wind chimes") lean toward the conventional, which holds the score back from the highest band, but line-level propulsion is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is high-quality with strong sensory density ("clicks like seeds," "air wrapped in wet cloth"). The writing is polished and rhythmic, avoiding artifacts or clutter, though a few phrases approach the border of being slightly precious ("sank holding hands").

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density ("checking a cracked compass"). A slight repetition of the phrase "half truth" (three times in a short space) creates a minor loop, but the imagery is otherwise fresh and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally strong with good sensory density ("brass note faded," "night wind flipped pages"). There are minor lapses into purple phrasing ("sea had learned to whisper words") that distract from the otherwise clean efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and no significant technical errors. There is a tendency toward adjectival density ("crystalline orchard," "shimmering crater," "glimmering obsidian") that occasionally slows momentum. However, the imagery is precise, and the line-level craft supports the story’s atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with high imagery ("loops sank like hooks"). There is a cluster of filter verbs in the climax ("felt," "realized," "found") that slightly dulls the immediacy of the heist, and the mid-section relies on efficient but summarized exposition from Orren.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong imagery ("laugh, close enough to bruise"). The rhythm supports the magical atmosphere. There are no significant artifacts or loops, though the explicit labeling of emotions ("tenderly furious") leans slightly on telling over showing in isolated instances.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally polished but occasionally overwrought ("breathed a sapphire hush" in the opening). Phrasing like "moved kindly methodical" reads as ungrammatical rather than stylistic, and the density of metaphors sometimes obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and image-rich without becoming purple; lines like "boundaries... began to soften, reluctantly, like bark taking rain" are excellent. The writing avoids scaffold and maintains strong forward momentum, though a few transitions rely on standard temporal markers ("One late afternoon," "By noon").

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally high-quality with strong imagery, but the verbatim repetition of three complex phrases ("wryly earnest," "thresh meaning," "haggard awe") constitutes a significant artifact loop. This repetition makes the writing feel formulaic and dulls the impact of the closure. The density is good, but these specific artifacts block a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is lyrical and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("swallowed in midnight"), but suffers from repetitive phrasing. The required phrase "overlapping shadows" appears multiple times in quick succession, creating a lexical loop that distracts from the flow. A few "told" realizations flatten the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("gaps that felt like reefs"). There is a tendency toward aphoristic summary ("a town without its broken pieces...") that borders on sentimentality, but the line-level craft is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose features strong imagery ("smelled faintly of ink") but occasionally drifts into purple territory ("hour that divides bad habits") and cliché ("insomniacs tried prayer"). Abstract descriptions in the finale blur the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic ("prayer flags made of math," "unheard symphony tuning itself") with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. The metaphoric systems (math, music, sea) blend coherently, supporting the magical realist tone without slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("mutiny gathered like a council," "lightning bored him") is functional and evocative, supporting the tone without slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and polished, with standout lines like "sell a stranger his own shadow" and "margins were for people." There is zero scaffold or synonym churn; every sentence advances character or action. The imagery is precise, reinforcing the themes of death and calculation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the prose is generally evocative, a severe editing artifact in paragraph 17 ("At dawn he charted it again, by charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn as he always did") creates a disruptive loop during a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is high-density and propulsive, with strong verb choices ("record hardened," "name slid off"). The imagery is consistent with the established voice (tactile sound), and there are no visible loops or scaffold artifacts. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the tidal pacing of the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level craft is polished, with strong imagery ("seconds folded like paper," "cheerful as a lantern in drizzle"). There is a tendency toward slightly purple abstraction ("whisper of closing pages thickened"), but the sensory density is generally high. Rhythm and flow are well-managed, though some "and then" sequencing appears in the object discovery phase.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with some strong imagery ("engines like teeth," "stitched from pontoons"), though it occasionally leans into density that slows momentum. However, the reliance on summary phrasing and repetitive sentence structures ("She was," "She kept," "She fed") limits the rhythmic variety and dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is generally high-density and evocative ("bloom across words," "surrendered"). However, the phrasing "pinched a single nightwatch's hourglass sand grain" is a clumsy noun stack that momentarily disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is high-density and rhythmically assured, with evocative phrasing like "trapped insect trying to remember the sky." The figurative language is frequent but coherent within the established voice, creating a polished, atmospheric surface without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and lyrical ("creaks as if remembering warmer hinges"), with a strong rhythm that matches the story’s contemplative yet tense mood. Metaphors are generally fresh and serve the theme, though occasionally the density of figurative language ("air itself had been edited") risks slight opacity. Line-level polish is high.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, fitting the subject, though it occasionally drifts into strained imagery ("listened harder than anyone breathed"). There is a reliance on "writerly" descriptions that prioritize sound over precision, but the line-level momentum is generally preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lush, evocative imagery like "stored stillness held like breath behind teeth" creates a strong, consistent texture. However, the text suffers from a visible loop (repeating "overrode instinct" in two separate paragraphs) and relies on a few familiar similes ("unanswered prayers") that dampen the otherwise high quality of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense, evocative, and propulsive with no wasted scaffolding. Phrases like "beam politely ignored" and "lattice warmed in my pocket like a coal" show high-level craft. The rhythm supports the tension without falling into repetitive patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery. However, the verbatim repetition of the phrase "ephemeral cameo appearance" creates a noticeable rhythmic artifact that momentarily disrupts the otherwise seamless flow.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and rhythmically sophisticated ("spirals look like waves frozen mid crash"), creating a strong atmospheric density. While high-quality, the reliance on summary leads to some "telling" of emotional states rather than showing them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density. There are minor artifacts of prompt-adherence, such as the verbatim repetition of "purposeful wandering," but the line-level craft is generally strong and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, evocative, and propulsive, with no visible scaffolding or loops. The imagery is precise ("staccato signature of pressure"), and the rhythm modulates effectively between the quiet observation of dawn and the tension of the courier's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and image-rich ("whispers from under ice"), moving the narrative forward with efficiency. Line-level craft is high, with only minor reliance on filter verbs ("seemed to click") slightly softening the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with standout lines like "knitting its jagged edge smooth as a tongue learning gentleness." A minor deduction for the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "fierce tenderness," which reads slightly as a scaffold artifact rather than a natural recurrance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is polished with strong sensory density ("ink swelled where tears had touched it"). The required phrase "lotus hearted ache" disrupts the register slightly, but overall rhythm and syntax are handled with competence.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the prose is polished, there is a distracting over-reliance on "X like Y" similes (old wool, black ribbon, negatives, seeds, dawn/dew, lanterns, lamp). This repetitive syntactic pattern creates a predictable cadence that dulls the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and no scaffold loops. Images like "varnish that kept the world from breathing" and "dolls of attention" are fresh and serve the drive lens by reinforcing the textural/accumulative logic of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. The insertion of required phrases like &quot;candidly cryptic&quot; and &quot;converging chaos&quot; is handled smoothly, though the phrasing &quot;stealing despair, returning curiosity&quot; feels slightly rhetorical. No significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("listening ear," "drinking the blooded sea") driving the momentum. Minor compound-adjective stacking occurs, but the lines generally do double duty for atmosphere and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished, with excellent rhythm and high information density. Phrases like "cracked clean through" and "stutter" provide concrete tactile grounding amidst the surrealism. The prose avoids scaffold and moves efficiently, though "gently systematic" is a repeated stylistic marker that some might find slightly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the prose is generally competent, it suffers from noticeable clichés like "clear as a tear" and "ink in water" that mar the literary texture. Crucially, the climax summarizes the pivotal action ("Mara confessed everything") instead of rendering it in scene, which flattens the emotional impact at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally evocative and polished ("pale threads of blue... as if a map had been pulled through glue"). There is a slight drag in momentum during the explanation of the chemical analysis ("By analyzing... she could tell... because..."), which reads a bit like an expository insert to satisfy the prompt requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. Phrasing like "paper carried music longer than lungs" and "boots left no mud" demonstrates excellent economy and evocative power.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose has moments of beauty but suffers from overwrought metaphors ("leaps no wider than a human promise") that obscure physical reality. The non-standard adverb "featherly" is used twice, creating a noticeable artifact that breaks immersion. The rhythm is generally good, but the density of abstract imagery sometimes slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally exquisite, with high density and vivid imagery. However, the specific phrase "softly ingenious" appears twice in a short space (once for care, once for hands), creating a repetitive artifact that momentarily breaks the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from redundancy and heavy-handed metaphor. A notable scaffold artifact occurs in the bird sequence ("I follow them, via the scattered seeds dropped by a migrating bird"), where the clause repeats information established in the immediate prior sentence, creating a clumsy rhythm. Some figurative language ("laughter in mourning clothes") feels decorative rather than precise.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong image systems ("stars hung sharp as pins," "water might lick the floorboards"). The pacing accelerates appropriately during the rescue, using punchier syntax ("Wood flexed, the latch popped") to match the action.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful ("glittered like a trapped tide"). The integration of the prompt phrase "spontaneously anchored" is grammatically functional but creates a slight rhythmic bump; otherwise, line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with good sensory grounding. Some abstract phrasing slows momentum, but the line-level craft is generally competent.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished, but the climax is summarized ("she chose to enlighten him") rather than shown. Some metaphors feel slightly strained ("soot and blame") and the pivotal action is narrated rather than experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative with high momentum; images like "shops closing with apologies" are efficient and striking. There is no scaffold or filler; the rhythm supports the "lucid" quality of the protagonist's mind. The line-level craft is publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose density is high and imagery is evocative ("green curtain," "dreaming aloud"). The use of abstract summaries for emotional beats ("legacy's burden") slightly weakens the otherwise tactile line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally strong with evocative imagery, but suffers from occasional overwriting (e.g., "calm as a pond that knows stones will sink"). The required phrase "perceptively calm" reads awkwardly and appears to be a forced inclusion that disrupts the otherwise smooth flow.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but relies on a few distinct clichés ("hair had forgotten its original color," "heavier... than any weapon") and slightly purple phrasing ("indifferent waltz," "violet air") that detract from the otherwise high specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like the coat flapping "like a flag that had forgotten its nation." Rhythm and syntax support the tension well, with no significant scaffold or loop artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically assured, with high sensory density ("unlace expectations," "pleased blindness"). A few metaphors approach overwriting ("grammar of the body," "lullaby of conformity"), but the overall texture is sophisticated and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose relies too heavily on explanatory scaffolding and summary (e.g., "He came here to explore ethical storytelling," "Mara told him she did not want..."). These "telling" artifacts rob scenes of immediacy. While the imagery is often good, the connective tissue is expository, acting as a shortcut through the emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is high-density and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("hiccuping beat," "ribbon of orange dots"). A few phrases lean towards the precious ("thin as memory"), and the repetition of "blush" forms a noticeable lexical cluster, but the overall craft is polished and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished and high-density with strong sensory verbs ("chewed and patched," "accepted the punctures"). The phrase "snowmelt ardor" feels slightly overwrought compared to the otherwise grounded technical language, but the overall rhythm supports the methodical pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally dense and rhythmic ("hatch sighs open as if it remembers"). A few artifacts detract, such as the filler "literally" in "literally rotting" and the cliché "crow's nest," alongside the told-not-shown prompt insertion of "precisely playful."

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. Phrases like "the sky still paid in steady light" work hard to establish mood and character simultaneously. A minor point: the "mirror-face" imagery is slightly familiar, but the execution remains sharp and free of drag or clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-impact lines like "resentment thickening into something like certainty." The rhythm supports the pacing, particularly during the climax. There are no significant loops or artifacts; the "telling" regarding the healer is efficient and necessary for the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and rich, with high information density and rhythmic control. The density of similes (eight "like" constructions) borders on heavy, but the imagery ("boots that sank into mulch and history," "lungs became a metronome") is generally functional and evocative. The line-level craft supports the dreamlike logic without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally high-density and evocative ("contract snapped like dry twigs," "blue as river shade"). The score is held back by a few moments of expository filtering ("Mira realized," "Mira recognized") and the forced insertion of prompt phrases that read as labels rather than organic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic, managing complex temporal concepts with clarity. While the required phrase "simply complicated" creates a minor rhythmic hiccup, the surrounding imagery ("pale oval that seemed to wait for a face") compensates with high precision.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density, though occasionally leans into purple phrasing ("shook as if clearing its throat"). No significant artifacts or loops, though the "Lysa [verb]" sentence structure becomes slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from metaphor congestion in places (e.g., "music played without breath," "unkindled solace," "braided and buried" in close succession). The phrase "unkindled solace" is used twice, drawing attention to itself as a prompt insertion rather than organic vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished with strong lyrical moments ("ink and fiber shared one alphabet"), though the repetition of "warmly methodical" feels like a prompt-check artifact. Some metaphors land well, while the summary of the treaty's contents slows the rhythm slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no visible scaffolding artifacts. Images like "fractures recorded pressures the way ink recorded words" demonstrate strong command of metaphor. Rhythm varies effectively to match the tension of the scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is polished with strong rhythmic control and evocative imagery ("combed its ribs," "stitched the sky"). The insertion of the specific phrase "thistle-blown hope" feels slightly forced within its sentence, but otherwise, the prose is dense and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is high-density and evocative, with strong sensory details like "pale slabs" and "lightning stitched." The rhythm supports the contemplative yet urgent tone, with no significant scaffold or loop artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally dense and rhythmic ("gates were closed like a clenched jaw"), supporting the fable-like tone. Minor abstractions ("gravity of hopelessness") and slight clichés ("heavier than stone") prevent a higher score, but the line-level craft is polished.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality figurative language like "coral that cuts while it builds" and "opened the black rock like a book." The rhythm supports the pacing well, slowing during the "syrup" moment of the charm and flowing during the release, with no visible artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally evocative and dense ("fear was just air with a story"), though a few required elements create slight syntactic stiffness ("stretching contracted," "intangibly tangible"). The rhythm supports the tension of the climb and the release of the ending effectively. No significant artifacts or loops disrupt the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with imagery ("milky with sharp needles," "corridor in transit"). Sentences flow with a fluid logic that mirrors the protagonist's worldview, maintaining momentum while allowing for moments of poetic stillness. There are no significant artifacts or drag, and the diction is precisely calibrated.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the imagery is polished ("fragment of sunrise trapped in mineral code"), the prose is hamstrung by repetitive sentence structures ("She read," "She locked," "She knelt," "She found") that create a drumbeat cadence. This scaffold-like sequencing reduces momentum and makes the action feel mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a high density of similes ("like cloth," "like skin," "like wet ash," "like water," "like trapped air") in close proximity. This figurative saturation creates a distancing effect and occasionally muddles the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery like "chalky bricks" and "honest ash." A few phrases verge on overwrought (e.g., "glow stitched shadows to wonder"), but the rhythm generally supports the magical atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery like the "bridge sketched in ash" and "spring sang under his fingertips." There are minor moments of purple phrasing ("first yawn of evening," "scholar's hunger") that draw attention to the writing rather than the scene. Overall, the line-level craft supports the mythic tone without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally lyrical and dense, but the specific repetition of "shivering bliss" (a prompt artifact) constitutes a text loop that dulls the ending. The phrase "factually mystical certainty" reads as an awkward adjectival stack that disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is high-density and evocative ("skin of gray," "lightning vein"). The rhythm supports the emotional gravity. However, the dialogue at the climax leans slightly into written prose rather than natural speech, feeling a bit too perfectly constructed for the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery ("door in her chest," "starlight braid"). The rhythm supports the urgency of the "plans unraveling" timeframe, though a few transitions between locations feel slightly breathless.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and lyrical, effectively using "negative space" and musical terminology to ground the magic system. A minor shift to present tense to explain the grotto's rules creates a slight textural bump, but the overall propulsion and imagery are distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally polished, but noun pile-ups like "moonstone cabochon dust speck" create clutter. The mandatory phrase "emerged transformed always" is inserted ungrammatically, drawing attention to itself as an artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and evocative imagery ("black flakes still drifted down like moths"). Minor clichés like "trapdoor yawned" appear, but overall the line-level craft supports the story's atmospheric weight effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Imagery is dense and evocative (“empty face... like a missing tooth,” “sinking like slag”). A few lines explain their symbols too explicitly ("means kintsugi intentions," "factually mystical"), acting as minor drags on an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("confession stuck in its throat," "wobble and brighten"). Minor reliance on summary to establish the theme ("Laughter was her strange medicine") prevents a higher score, but the line-level craft is otherwise precise and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative ("bruise that gives light"), but the verbatim repetition of the clunky phrase "remembering through trauma responses" creates a visible scaffold artifact. This repetition disrupts the otherwise seamless rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished but marred by oxymoronic clunkiness in required phrases ("elusively tangible," "single eternal instant") that feel inserted rather than organic. The density is good, but the reliance on abstract emotional labels ("anchors of intuition") flattens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of scaffold; lines like "the living lie with words, but dust never does" add texture without stalling momentum. The imagery is precise ("cracked into a grin of white plaster") and the sentence structures vary purposefully to control pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally polished and dense with imagery. The opening phrase "swirling sea of clouds" is a slightly generic descriptor that weakens the hook, but later descriptions like "nervous leaves" and "click of the rollers" are sharp and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("striking the mirrors like thrown coins"), though the climax relies on indirect discourse ("Len confessed...") which dampens the immediacy of the pivotal negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative; phrasing like "headache of quiet" and "silence pressed on Ivo's teeth" anchors abstract concepts in physical sensation. The description of the mechanical repair is precise and rhythmic, avoiding technical dryness.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong rhythm and evocative phrasing ("caves that drink storms"). The metaphorical density is high but generally effective ("crevice breathes cool air"). There are no significant scaffold artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally polished but relies on filter verbs ("Mara realizes," "Mara understands") to bridge logic gaps instead of showing the cognitive leap. Some phrasing feels constructed to scaffold the prompt elements rather than flowing naturally from the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished and vivid, though it occasionally leans into ornamental description ("vivid enough to warm"). The reliance on filter verbs ("she noticed," "she saw," "she learned") during discovery beats distances the reader from the sensory immediacy of the revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrically strong ("dunes swallowed a black pool"), showing high craft in imagery. However, the sentence structure suffers from a repetitive "I [verb]" cadence ("I left," "I saw," "I woke," "I understood," "I followed"), creating a monotone rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery and no visible artifacts or loops. The line-level craft successfully supports the fable tone, though "deserted alchemist" (likely meaning "deserter" or "disillusioned") reads as a slight usage ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative ("dust of decades rose," "heartbeat embedded"), though it occasionally leans into purple phrasing ("velvet disquiet," "shape of grief itself"). The rhythm supports the contemplative mood well.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("bell struck from within," "sweetness like pollen"), though "dawn finally bled" and "wind through reeds" lean toward cliché. The required attribute "furiously tranquil" appears twice in identical phrasing, which creates a minor repetitive artifact. Rhythm and syntax generally support the story's "wild serenity" well.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally vivid and precise ("dark river through the rafters"), but integration of required elements creates visible scaffolding. The redundancy in "glued in place fully set, after the glue dries" and the repetition of "credibly curious" as a modifier disrupt the otherwise high-quality line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished with strong rhythm and memorable imagery ("barnacle on the night"). There is a slight tendency toward compound sentence structures ("He [verb]... and [verb]...") that creates a repetitive cadence, but the line-level craft is generally high quality.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose density is high with strong rhythm and imagery ("ash that settled on my tongue like vows"). The repetition of the phrase "contextual clues" creates a slight mechanical artifact, and the explicit thematic sentence in the latter half slows the momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high-density imagery ("faith could tick," "confession"). There is a slight over-reliance on similes in the climax paragraph ("like a closing eyelid," "like a coat") which briefly clutters the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose rhythm is generally smooth, but the text suffers from "poet-voice" artifacts where abstract metaphors ("maps of missing pieces") replace concrete action. Line-level polish is evident, but the reliance on adjectives to carry weight softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic with high-density imagery ("veined with lichen," "rain turned the courtyard into a shallow mirror"). However, the discovery beat relies on filter verbs ("noticed," "realized") rather than direct experience, and the summary mode limits the visceral impact of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with high information density ("stones shone like cooled bronze"). Imagery serves the plot; the description of the "microcrystals arranged like tiny ladders" acts as both atmosphere and evidence. No drag or artifacts detected.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is rhythmically strong and dense with imagery ("stitching their names together," "roots threading through bullet fragments"). Information density is high, and the lines propel the ritual forward without stalling. A few phrases lean slightly toward the ornate ("horizon feels like an unrolled scroll"), but they generally serve the mythic register well.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is dense and evocative, though "welded rebar and prayer" is a stock construction that feels out of place. The imagery of "tinted revelations" and "bolts cooling" is sharp, maintaining high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("compass made of starlight and patient pencil dust"). A deduction applies for the repetitive phrasing in the climax ("turned the confusion... into a map... turn confusion into exploration"), which stumbles in rhythm and economy.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by physically dubious shorthand like "knocked him gently cold" and adjective-heavy constructions. These conveniences smooth over the visceral reality of the violence and danger, reducing the scene's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with no visible artifacts or padding; the required phrases are integrated seamlessly. The rhythm varies effectively to match the tension, particularly during the unbinding sequence and the arrival of the guards.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from a severe overuse of simile scaffolding. There are at least ten "like" or "as if" constructions in a short text (e.g., "like cliff faces," "as if the building listened," "like broken mirrors," "as if holding back lightning," "as if the mountain inhaled"). This repetitive structure creates a rhythmic drone and distances the reader from immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.5)
    While much of the prose is lyrical and dense ("pinched the hour," "unpicked only by decoding"), the integration of required elements creates distinct grammatical and rhythmic flaws. Specifically, the tense mismatch in "paused and fidgets productively" and "carried... and... fidgets" is a basic error. Additionally, the verbatim repetition of the long decoding phrase at the climax clogs the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, evocative, and propulsive, successfully balancing lyrical imagery with narrative clarity. There are no significant loops or scaffolding artifacts; the writing is polished and supports the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("hissed where spray kissed brass"), with strong verb choices. There is a slight tendency toward overwriting in moments of reflection ("constellations punched into stone"), but the line-level craft generally supports the magical realism tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with high density and strong imagery ("tunnels fork like veins"). The rhythm supports the contemplative pacing without stalling momentum, though the density of figurative language is high.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and fresh imagery ("wood polished by decades of salt and worry"). The sentences have strong propulsion and sonic texture. The prose successfully balances the abstract ("purified intentions") with the concrete ("dents his foghorn had punched").

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and strong sensory details like "lanterns look like a second sky." The choice to present the story as a single dense block (or long paragraphs) supports the breathless, accumulative feel, though it risks reading as a monologue. Line-level craft is strong, with very few wasted words or generic descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, balancing action with rich sensory details like "wind thread the ladders" and "clinic of quiet." The writing remains propellant and clear even when handling abstract concepts, with no visible artifacts or scaffold loops to mar the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. The only minor artifact is the second use of "Softly persistent" as a front-loaded sentence opener ("Softly persistent, he worked..."), which feels slightly mechanical compared to the seamlessness of the rest.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and sensory ("water licked her calves," "white fungi rose like lilies"), maintaining momentum through the action beats. A few phrases lean slightly towards cliché ("panel slid aside with a sigh"), but the overall texture is polished and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery ("stitch patterns in the dark," "leaking a thread of bright, slow blood"). No significant artifacts or loops. The rhythm supports the escalating tension, particularly in the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("word sell fell like ash," "breathing red"). However, a few metaphors border on overwriting ("old lava met new ideas"), and the density sometimes slows momentum. The line-level craft is high-quality but occasionally prioritizes poetic flourish over immediate clarity in the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and no visible scaffolding or repetition artifacts. Imagery is consistently fresh ("hunts it, teeth out," "page torn free"), and the rhythm of the sentences supports the tension of the dream sequences. The final line delivers a strong rhythmic and conceptual landing.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and dense with sensory imagery ("softening brass gears," "reddish tarnish"). Metaphors are generally strong, though occasionally dense ("ink blots like swallowed words"), but they serve the POV well.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is high-density and evocative, with strong imagery like "pain were contagious" and "chains humming in a saturated hush." However, the integration of long required element phrases creates occasional noun stacks (e.g., "floating rock tea ceremony platform," "crow quill trimmed tip") that drag on the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is lush, rhythmically controlled, and high in information density, with evocative details like "ozone and old pears." While the metaphor count is very high, it is pattern-taught by the character's worldview and does not obscure the action, creating a cohesive "ethereal grit" texture.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("reknit itself into a corridor"). There is a slight over-reliance on abstract metaphors ("ruins of certainty," "fog") that occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery ("two blades crossing," "swallowed the sound"). Rhythm is controlled, and the "counting backwards" motif is integrated well into the sentence structure during the repair sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery. The sentence-level craft supports the "quiet tension" well, though the climactic emotional beat leans slightly on labeled abstraction ("anger and relief") rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but word echoes mar the immersion (four uses of "mica pane," four of "clover"). The phrasing "widen perspectives responsibly" feels stiff and expository within the otherwise lyrical flow. Density is high, but the repetition suggests a need for tighter line-level editing.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense, evocative, and rhythmically precise. Images like the "glass harmonica disc" and "teach endings how to begin" serve the story without feeling like purple ornamentation. There is no wasted motion; sentence-level craft supports the atmospheric weight of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythmic control ("joy had to borrow a ghost's throat"). The imagery is fresh and precise, avoiding cliché while maintaining a lyrical momentum that supports the magical realist tone.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and high-quality, with original imagery ("jokes the way others made fire," "swallowed by green") that enhances the atmosphere. The sentence rhythm is controlled, though the repetition of the phrase "improbable rumor chains" is a minor echo.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense and evocative, achieving high information density with images like "grammar of heartbeats." The rhythm is strong, though the density of adjectival metaphors occasionally slows propulsion in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("scratched a line that looked almost wet"), but occasionally lapses into expository scaffolding ("The contradiction was the point"). Some metaphors feel slightly standard ("time pooled like dark water"), but the density of image generally supports the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from a density of metaphor that occasionally obscures the action. Phrases like "water held lanterns like floating commas" are evocative but verge on purple when stacked with "footprints forget" and "ribs ring." There are no major technical errors, but the reliance on abstract descriptors reduces line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is rhythmic and dense, though it occasionally relies on overwrought metaphors ("fire was a scream of protection," "tenderness surged like magma") that draw attention to the writing rather than the moment. Line-level mechanics are otherwise clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is rhythmically strong but dense with metaphor ("ink and saline," "hush of the universe inhaling"), occasionally drifting into purple territory. While the imagery is evocative, the density of figurative language sometimes slows the narrative momentum in key causal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "little constellations catching the storm light" and "voice crackling in aurora static." Sentence structure varies well to match the pacing of the rescue, and there are no visible artifacts or loops. The tactile descriptions of the maps and the key add meaningful texture.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from simile density ("like a bruised coin," "like a staircase," "like silt," "like a lid," "like a loom"), which creates a repetitive syntactic rhythm. "Spiralingly calm" is an awkward construction that clashes with the otherwise sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically competent, though it occasionally tilts into overwrought sentimentality ("hush where past meets prophecy"). There is a reliance on abstract nouns (silence, quiet, hush) to do the work of concrete imagery. While the sentence structures vary, the lack of hard, concrete interaction makes the text feel floaty.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with sensory detail ("ribs hum," "hump of coral"). The line "no blade could draw blood anymore, only shame" is particularly strong, blending world-building with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is high-density and evocative, utilizing strong imagery ("stone into snow," "treaty between species") to carry emotional weight. The rhythm modulates effectively, slowing for the intimate whittling scene and accelerating for the release of the petals.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery ("sound itself has learned to fold its wings," "crack he might still seal"). The repetition of "lantern-moth" works as a motif rather than a loop. Phrasing is purposeful and distinct, though the "aesthetically driven" descriptor in the opening feels slightly more diagnostic than the rest of the text.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rich and sensory ("glitters... like cooled tears"), effectively sustaining the atmosphere. A few metaphors ("bites her palm like an honest mistake") border on abstraction, but the density and rhythm are generally excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished, but the density of metaphors ("jars of quiet," "shattering hands") occasionally borders on overwriting. Some action beats blur into abstraction ("questions... leapt from hand to hand") rather than concrete movement.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic, with high-quality imagery ("whispers like dust," "coaxed a single green point to rise"), though occasionally the metaphor-heavy description slows momentum. Some phrasing feels slightly familiar ("hands that still shook"), but the overall density and polish are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose density is high with memorable imagery ("slang that spread like mold") and strong rhythmic control. The writing is polished and evocative without falling into purple prose, though the score is capped by the Q2 global gate.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers slightly from density in figurative language (e.g., "walls sweated forgotten names," "joy... hurt like a pulled tooth"). These metaphors, while vivid, crowd the high-pressure beats. Mechanically, the sentences propel the narrative well without drag.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong imagery ("sunlight thinned to amber") is marred by awkward integration of required phrases. "Rubbed it softly deliberate" reads as a grammatical stumble or forced fit, and the verbatim repetition of "luminous regret" reduces the prose's polish.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high sensory specificity ("chalk squeaked softly," "hiss of mist"). Sentences propel the narrative forward without scaffold or drag, and the imagery of the tail tip is handled with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is evocative but relies heavily on "X like Y" similes (pebble, veins, ink), which creates a repetitive cadence that slightly dilutes the imagery's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with evocative imagery ("shame itself had archived it," "corridors of air"). While the density of similes is high, they are functionally distinct and deepen the atmosphere without stalling momentum or confusing the action.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and evocative imagery like the "birch bark map" and "grit on the tongue." A few similes ("bruise of green fire," "clear as bells") are slightly mixed or lean on cliché, which detracts momentarily from the otherwise strong textural quality. The pacing flows well, mirroring the ritualistic nature of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density. Imagery is evocative ("dawn had gotten trapped under skin"). Minor reliance on filter-like phrasing ("I understood," "I heard") is present but unobtrusive; the rhythm successfully supports the story's dreamlike logic.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. Imagery is precise and functional ("needle of dark," "ribs around an empty center"), driving the narrative forward with rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm and imagery are generally strong, though occasionally dip into standard phrasing ("lungs burn," "feet heavy"). The "star on the punch flashes... like a small promise" leans heavily on abstraction over concrete observation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in lines like "muting the world until even my breath sounded like a trespass." No significant artifacts or loops; the rhythm supports the tension of the silent environment.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and lyrical but suffers from a high density of similes (e.g., "like collapsed prayers," "like courtiers"), which occasionally makes the texture feel overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity ("drifting in its leash like a patient animal"). Sentence rhythm varies effectively to control pacing, and there are no visible loop artifacts or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally high-density and rhythmic ("Thunder rolled... repair bay breathed"), but the verbatim repetition of the phrase "awkwardly confident" (and a third variation) within a short word count creates a noticeable lexical artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.5)
    Imagery is strong ("stone roads over ash," "embryo in amber"), creating a solid visual texture. However, some pivotal beats are summarized rather than dramatized, and the "telepathic" line is a scaffold that disrupts the prose's immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose density is high with strong imagery ("crease lines looked like maps of ruined streets"), though the required phrase "somatic markers" reads as slightly clinical narration in a peak beat. Sentence rhythm effectively mirrors the shift from panic to the steady labor of planting.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("prisms were webbed with old, knotted filaments"). The imagery is specific and propulsive, avoiding clutter even while maintaining a poetic register.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("bright thought that refused to land"). While generally effective, some sentences become slightly breathless or over-extended with "as if" constructions, though the momentum remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose rhythm is strong, with high information density and evocative imagery ("ink could bloom into rumor"). A few phrasing choices driven by required elements feel forced ("dangerous liaison letter"), but the overall line-level craft is polished and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("catch the last soot... like dark snow"). It suffers slightly from overwrought phrasing in places ("senselessly perceptive," "reflex hard as leather") that prioritizes poetic sound over precise meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose density is high with no scaffold or loops; lines like "voicing silence until the air around his tongue turned dense as water" do double duty for atmosphere and mechanics. The rhythm varies effectively to match the "zigzag" pacing of the protagonist's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose density is high with strong imagery ("rain tick," "writing should cut clean"). A few filter constructions ("she saw how," "she watched") slightly distance the reader in key moments. The writing is precise and rhythmically controlled, avoiding major artifacts while propelling the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and imagery-rich ("baby crying under water"). A minor syntactic ambiguity regarding the "letters found in furniture across the city" creates a momentary stumble in logic, but the overall rhythm and clarity are high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density and strong imagery like the "coin in a fever." The repetition of "lilac" (color and mood) is a bit close, and the direct telling of traits ("steady attention of someone socially perceptive") is a minor craft slip in an otherwise well-wrought piece.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally strong and rhythmic but occasionally slips into abstraction or mixed metaphor (e.g., "blue fit like truth into a wound," "sound like winter"). These moments, while evocative, prioritize poetic effect over clarity, creating minor friction in an otherwise polished text.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lush but hampered by frequent filter verbs ("sounded to her," "she realized," "she saw") and explanatory clauses that dilute the immediacy of the climax. The density of imagery is high, but the reliance on mental summaries ("remembered the first summer") slows the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and vivid, with strong imagery like the "lattice of light." However, the phrase "fractures that looked fractally precise" creates an awkward root-word repetition (fracture/fractal) that disrupts the rhythm. Additionally, the final phrase "willowglass hope" leans slightly toward purple prose, though the sentence-level propulsion is otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. Phrasing like "thin as paper and hard as time" creates immediate, efficient texture that serves both atmosphere and character.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is polished and rich in imagery ("canyon echo in a jar," "braid of voices"), but the reliance on "telling" via summary lists ("She invited the night watch, then the loaders") reduces the immediacy. The beauty of the lines often masks a lack of concrete, dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant repetition of distinct phrases ("silver hush" x3, "accumulated snow" x2, "tilt... toward spring" x2) within a short word count makes the prose feel mechanical. The confusion between literal and metaphorical imagery regarding the salt and burns creates opacity at the emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative with high information density. The integration of required phrases is mostly smooth, though the grammatical awkwardness of "until rain gutters stop ticking" (mandated phrase) creates a slight rhythmic hitch. No significant loops or scaffold artifacts; the writing is polished and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and sensory-rich ("chimney smoke flattens," "pressed-gray lid," "honest dust"). Sentence rhythm varies effectively to match the pacing of the discovery and the ritual, with no visible artifacts or scaffolding loops.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose has a pleasing rhythm but suffers from repetitive diction (multiple uses of "luminous," "moonlight," "hush") and some cliché phrasing ("bones in the moonlight," "spill of silver"). The required phrase "quivering hush" appears twice, drawing attention to itself as an artifact rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is high-density and evocative ("carrying their shadows like a passport nobody checked"). The imagery is precise and propulsive, with no significant artifacts or drag.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose rhythm is generally smooth, but the text relies on dense adjectival strings and similes ("tight as a fingerprint," "like a floating constellation") that clutter the imagery. The phrase "prismatic quiet" reads as a lexical collision that breaks the established voice, and the reliance on "told" metaphors reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense, propulsive, and free of scaffolding or loop artifacts. Images like “prayer spoken through concrete” serve both atmosphere and character economy. This category hits the score ceiling imposed by the Q2 cap; otherwise, the line-level craft would rate higher.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is rhythmically strong and dense with imagery ("pulsed through stone like sonar"). However, there is a tendency toward overwrought metaphors ("closet of airless bricks") and heavy personification that occasionally obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally polished and rhythmic, though occasional phrases lean into cliché ("laugh like broken glass") or melodrama ("lance the air"). The mechanical efficiency of the writing keeps the story moving but sometimes sacrifices nuance for speed.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence-level craft is generally competent, but marred by logical artifacts like the "slot shaped like a coffin seam"—a physically incoherent image that serves only the plot. Some metaphors feel strained ("rain that seemed to soak straight into thought"), and the final paragraph leans on summary to rush the conclusion. Rhythm is functional but lacks the propulsion expected at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally polished but marred by occasional purple phrasing ("moonlit syrup," "luminous disbelief") and awkward tells like "dynamically observant." These artifacts distract from otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished with high information density and evocative imagery ("dust fell like stage glitter"). Sentence rhythm is controlled, though the reliance on summary leads to some repetitive sentence structures ("I took," "I built," "I marked").

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, showing good control of sentence structure, though it occasionally lapses into purple phrasing ("gorge on solitary sorrow"). There is a reliance on abstract concepts ("grit of fact," "quiet weight") where concrete imagery would be sharper. The line-level craft is solid but lacks the hard edges required for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythmic control—&quot;branches circling in disciplined fury&quot; is a standout line. The imagery of the &quot;frozen confession&quot; as a man rather than words is a brilliant literalization of a metaphor. Minor issue: keyword repetition (circles, rings, mirror) becomes slightly noticeable, though it serves the rhythmic chant style of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally vivid and dense with imagery ("stitched rivers," "air tasted of rain"). However, occasional phrasing leans into cliché ("elation fluttered") or slightly overt similes ("pain flashed like a small private eclipse") that soften the otherwise sharp texture.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("smile thin as onion skin"), with strong rhythm. A few usages are slightly heterodox (e.g., "trammel it onto Jory," "barrow a stranger's destiny"), but they generally serve the agricultural/harvest metaphor well within the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "listened to arenas breathe." The writing avoids scaffold and maintains momentum, effectively using the specific vocabulary of the narrator's trade.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and evocative imagery ("gravity forgot her name"). The prose rhythm mirrors the protagonist's methodical nature while maintaining propulsion during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with zero loop artifacts or scaffold sentences. Every line serves dual purposes of world-building and interiority ("paper and salt do not forgive"), creating a rich texture that propels the narrative without drag.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery ("clung to the concrete like damp"). The ending relies on summary ("People began to speak," "Mara watched faces soften") rather than dramatized scene work, which slightly dissipates the tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and high-density, with strong imagery ("bellows patched with tape"). Minor awkwardness arises only where specific prompt words ("alluding to") are inserted, slightly disrupting the natural flow.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and high-density, with strong imagery ("memory wandered like a sleepwalker," "time to show its seams") and effective rhythmic variance. No mechanical loops or scaffolding artifacts were detected; the writing sustains momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no visible scaffolding artifacts. Phrasing like "music could be frozen into proof" and "choices leaked through" demonstrates a strong command of metaphor that serves the story's logic. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the tension and release of the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high information density. While the adjectival density is high ("frost-slick," "lucidly watchful," "radiant hush"), it fits the textural drive of the piece without obscuring clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. A slight over-reliance on similes ("like fermenting foam," "like a swallowed moon," "like the hush") occasionally draws attention to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is high-density and evocative, with strong imagery like "face without eyes" and "drinking the dawn." A few phrases feel slightly tell-heavy ("sincerely insincere," "insisting that her job was..."), but the rhythm and flow are professional and polished.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose achieves high density and rhythmic control ("breathing sound like a confession") without scaffolding artifacts. Imagery is functional, advancing the magic system's logic while sustaining the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is rhythmic and dense, with strong image-to-idea ratios (e.g., "history was the only map that never moved"). The sentence craft supports the slow, reverent pacing of the story well, avoiding scaffold or unnecessary filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density ("needle of blue ice thrust through sun"). Imagery is evocative without becoming purple, and the sentence structures vary effectively to control the pacing of the climb. No significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the prose is generally polished, the forced insertion of a required phrase creates a grammatical disjoint ("went down... by wandering purposefully"). Additionally, logical slips in the prose (setting a single lamp at multiple intervals simultaneously) and confusing metaphors ("breathing silt") detract from clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.3)
    High information density with evocative imagery ("stubborn little planets," "void is stuttering") and no scaffold artifacts. The prose rhythm accelerates effectively with the calibration sequence, and the "edgewise" motif pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract metaphors ("bruised relics," "silhouette made of endings") that blur imagery. Adjectival stacking ("tiny salt bright shards") sometimes slows the momentum during key descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic ("Nets hang like empty ribs"), with high information density that advances the story efficiently. Imagery is fresh and supports the tone without sliding into purple prose. No loops or distinct artifacts detected.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong imagery ("rooflines... rising from mud as if waking"). The line-level craft is high, though the reliance on "telling" verbs to bridge the time jumps (e.g., "I told them," "We set the recovered photographs") slightly flattens the momentum in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density and no visible scaffolding artifacts. Imagery is precise ("steady blue tongue," "moonlit wheat"), driving momentum without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in nearly every sentence. Metaphors like "wearing Courier Nine's voice like borrowed gloves" serve both description and plot diagnosis effectively. Rhythm varies appropriately between the meditative opening and the sharp, tactical climax.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and propulsive rhythm. While the imagery is strong ("blade parts fog"), the reliance on abstract nouns in key moments slightly distances the reader from the visceral reality of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is dense and generally polished, but suffers from abstract phrasing ("possibility just born") and structural "telling" that summarizes action instead of showing it. The explicit moralizing at the end acts as a text artifact that disrupts the narrative spell. Rhythm is good, but the reliance on summary slows the line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is evocative and polished ("dragged thin by concrete"), with high information density. A slight over-reliance on simile structures ("like a jar," "like a section," "like a heart," "like a prayer") creates a minor rhythmic scaffold, but the imagery itself remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like "eyes bright as trapped moons" and "rasp that sounded like pages turned too fast." No line-level artifacts or wasted scaffolding; the rhythm supports the dreamlike tension.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose flows well but leans into purple phrasing ("tears had learned to stand at attention") and technical metaphors ("successive approximation") that sit awkwardly in the fable-like tone. The inserted prompt phrase creates a definitive grammatical fault ("frowned... drops... understood") that disrupts the reading line.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and polished, with high information density and no scaffold loops. The metaphorical language ("shard of hush," "surrendered spear") is evocative without becoming purple, serving the story's atmospheric needs. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the "practical cadence" mentioned in the text, accelerating effectively during the dismantling sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm, but the repetition of specific prompt phrases (“resiliently positive,” “permanent transient”) as adjectival labels acts as visible scaffolding. Some metaphorical phrasing (“weighed like a promise”) leans toward density at the expense of precision.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("quiet so smooth that it scraped") with no scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The imagery is consistent and drives the narrative forward without pausing for ornamental description.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("glowed like deep stars," "stitched into arcs"). The "edge geometry" demonstration is described with admirable clarity. The score reflects a slight over-compression in the middle beats where scene work is traded for rapid synopsis.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("soft metronome," "fading like footsteps"), with a strong rhythmic reprise of "reeling hush." A minor deduction for the cliché "calm as rain," but otherwise the line-level craft is precise and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and strong rhythmic control ("leaning like tired animals"). The writing avoids scaffold and clutter, using evocative figurative language that enhances the "phase" concept without obscuring the action.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense and evocative, balancing strong verbs ("ribs still lift," "hard drives tick") with purposeful imagery without slipping into purple overwriting. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the pacing of the ritual, accelerating during the ink-spilling and slowing into the calm of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("consonants softened, as if time was sanding them down"). The rhythm supports the pacing, particularly in the climax, and there are no significant line-level artifacts or clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density. There are minor risks of overwriting in the descriptions of the anomaly ("gravity... hiccuped like a mischievous child"), but the line-level craft generally supports the tone. The climax is rendered with clarity despite the abstract nature of the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally high-quality with dense imagery ("discarded armor," "thirsty throb"). There is a slight over-reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("tarnished wonder," "polite expressions," "stone joints") and a repetitive subject-verb sentence cadence during the middle action sequence ("Lio pressed," "Lio kept," "He slipped," "He set") that creates a minor drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("thin as a folded envelope," "holding every footfall like a secret"). Sentence rhythm varies effectively to match the pacing of the scenes. There are no significant loops or scaffold artifacts, creating a smooth and immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.5)
    Significant lexical repetition mars the execution; the phrase "misting hush" appears four times and "quietly persistent" twice in a short space, creating distracting artifacts. These loops stall the momentum and read as unintentional echoes rather than purposeful motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and high-density, with strong imagery like "bookmark for the air" and "grain shifted... like a living proof." The sentence rhythm supports the pacing well, slowing down for the mathematical contemplation and flowing during the magical realization. There are no visible artifacts, loops, or filter-verb stacks to impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("fingertip that tingled like a lens"), effectively sustaining the magical mood. A few filter verbs in high-stakes moments ("felt it throb," "believing that") distance the reader slightly from the immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but relies too heavily on simile constructions ("pooled like ink," "smiling like a question," "rose like steam," "closed like a book"), some of which approach cliché. While the imagery is evocative, the density of "like/as" comparisons distracts from the immediacy of the action. Stronger direct metaphors would elevate the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("ribs visible at low tide," "water... sharpened"), maintaining strong momentum. Minor deductions for the logical artifact regarding the notebook and occasional filter verbs ("she realized," "she saw") that distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("listens like a lung holding breath," "pride makes its own key"). While the repetition of "combative tenderness" is slightly close, the imagery is consistently fresh and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose leans toward purple ("hymn sung under one's tongue," "kissed a bud," "exhale of green"), which slows momentum and feels overwrought for a modern literary standard. While the imagery is rich, the density of figurative language sometimes obscures the action. Trimming the adjectives would sharpen the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is high-density and polished, free of artifacts or scaffold. Imagery is fresh and functional ("glittered like a cut gem sunk into the dunes," "dissolved into soil like forgiven rope").

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose flows with a suitable rhythm, though occasional compound adjectives lack hyphens ("rain scoured," "side by side") and some imagery feels slightly ornamental ("colors washed to pale bones"). The density is good, but expository phrasing in the resolution drags the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("shadow with manners," "ink becomes a bruise"). The text avoids scaffold and loops, maintaining propulsion throughout. The line-level craft successfully elevates the somewhat heavy-handed concept.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no scaffolding artifacts. The line "time narrow to the space between lightning and thunder" is exceptional, instantly establishing the stakes and atmosphere. Imagery is fresh and specific, avoiding cliché while maintaining a smooth rhythmic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally high-quality with vivid imagery ("frozen candle"). However, phrasing like "encrypted diary discovery" is clunky, and the repetition of "unfolded" and the theme phrase slightly dampens the lexical variety.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and evocative, but the density of similes ("loose tooth," "shell," "mica," "pendulum") borders on overwriting, creating a slight drag on momentum. The "stern prayer of relief" phrase feels slightly clashing, but the overall line-level craft is high.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("smooth as a closed eyelid," "galaxies implied in flecks of ash") with excellent rhythmic control. Imagery consistently serves the central motif of patterns and nature without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally polished with nice imagery, but suffers from explicit telling ("diligently curious by habit," "sociable isolation") that disrupts immersion. Some filter verbs ("he saw," "he decided") distance the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished and high-density, with metaphors like "sorted... as neatly as prayers" adding texture without clutter. The recurring "driftwood" motif anchors the tone effectively, and the sentence rhythm mirrors the "patience" required by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished, with strong imagery ("translucent as mist yet steady as a lighthouse"). There is a slight tendency toward "purple" abstraction ("star-scented window," "belonging were fuel"), but the line-level craft is generally solid and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the imagery is dense, the prose suffers significantly from repetitive artifacting ("nested patterns" x3, "final ripple" x3, "vouchsafe" x2, "bruised awe" x2). These loops create a mechanical template cadence that distracts from the narrative flow and triggers substantial penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and rich with imagery ("click like a jaw," "reluctant applause"). However, the verbatim repetition of the phrase "offhandedly exact" as a dialogue tag twice in a short story creates a noticeable text artifact/loop that detracts from the otherwise high polish. This reuse feels mechanical rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is the story's strength, with polished syntax and evocative imagery ("rejoined like arguments," "stitched itself along invisible shear lines"). However, the pervasive use of summary drains momentum, and the metaphor density occasionally feels breathless and over-written for the lack of scenic action.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally high-quality lyrical prose, but marred by a severe loop in the opening paragraph: "floating upon a swirling sea of clouds" is repeated almost verbatim in adjacent sentences, and "glass" repeats clumsily in the first line. These artifacts significantly stall the hook.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose density is high with evocative phrasing ("worrying the desert," "remembered how to sweat") that establishes atmosphere immediately. The memory sequence uses a list structure that leans slightly toward summary, but the overall rhythm and imagery are precise and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from "telling" artifacts ("tender, vigorous decision"). There is a tendency toward summary and abstraction over concrete, sensory action in the back half.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished and dense with imagery, though it occasionally leans into abstractions ("quaking reverie"). The integration of technical jargon like "synaptic plasticity" with poetic diction creates a slight textural clash, but momentum remains steady.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong sensory imagery ("books hung like bats," "air turned viscous"). Phrasing is generally dense and propulsive, though "clandestinely luminous" is slightly clunky as a modifier pairing. The rhythm supports the pacing of the spiral walk and the urgency of the escape.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density and strong imagery (e.g., siskins like "moving rests on a staff") drive the narrative efficiently. Phrasing is polished with varied sentence structures, avoiding repetitive scaffolding or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally lush and evocative, with strong rhythmic control. However, awkward phrasing artifacts like "polished basalt worry stone dent" (grammatically implying the dent is the object) and "until before the next phase" (redundant prepositions) mar the polish. These line-level slips distract from an otherwise high-quality textural experience.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is overwritten, with a simile or metaphor in almost every sentence ("like a small orchestra," "flavor of hush," "like a shared secret," "like a stethoscope"). This density creates a purple texture that obscures the narrative momentum, and pivotal moments rely on telling ("The path to empathy was suddenly practical").

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and dense with imagery ("wave of graves and ripe pears"), supporting the sensory focus. A minor stumble with the clunky phrasing "olfactorily sensitive" in the opening paragraph disrupts the otherwise smooth lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and dense with high information load ("smelled of rain, as if time had hurried"). However, the single-paragraph structure limits pacing variety, and occasional phrases like "made even engines seem like thoughts" drift into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong sensory imagery ("frozen in the mind," "air behaved like a liquid") that supports the atmosphere without stalling momentum. The writing remains precise and propulsive, avoiding unnecessary scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is dense and sensory, but the climax suffers from repetitive diction (three uses of "unfetter" in close proximity) and cliché phrasing ("rationers weep"). These artifacts distract from the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong with evocative imagery ("throat" of the boulder, "iron rain"). However, the required phrase "avalanchingly quiet" is stylistically clumsy and appears twice, drawing attention to itself as an artifact rather than a natural description. The rhythm is otherwise controlled and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and polished, with high-quality imagery ("vellum washed with her own breath") and strong rhythmic control. The writing manages complex abstract concepts without losing momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lyrical and dense ("ribbon of frozen scree"), but the mechanical explanation of the magic ("by vibrating sympathetically") drags on the momentum. A few transition points rely on linear "and then" sequencing rather than causal propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative with high information density and no scaffold; imagery like "pale streetlamp fractured into bands" is precise. A minor note: the phrase "assumptions shattered" appears both as the prompt insertion and in the climax, which feels slightly repetitive, but the line-level craft is otherwise exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose suffers from significant artifacts, specifically the verbatim repetition of the long phrase "through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" in such a short text, which reads like a mechanical insertion. Additionally, the reliance on summary telling ("She understood then," "realizing the latent sacrifice") reduces immediacy and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally strong with evocative similes ("crumbling like bread"), but the use of the bureaucratic word "timeframe" creates a jarring register slip in a fantasy setting. Some emotional beats rely on abstract scaffolding rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and evocative imagery like "shivered like overlapped film." The prose maintains strong momentum and clarity, avoiding significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the prose is generally dense and evocative, the clumsy repetition of the phrase "the lamp flickers out"—which also introduces a grammatical tense error—is a glaring artifact that mars the reading experience. This specific flaw, likely a forced insertion of a required element, breaks the line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and rich, with striking imagery ("drank flame," "river in glass"). However, there is a tendency toward metaphor stacking ("jokes landed like dropped coins," "clouds... like congregants") and adjective-noun pairings ("shadowed elation") that occasionally slows momentum. The writing is high-quality but borders on ornate in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush and high-density, with evocative phrasing like "patient lantern" and "sutures became honest scar." It occasionally leans on filter verbs ("I began to understand," "I realized") to summarize internal states that could be sharper, but the line-level craft is otherwise polished and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is high-density and evocative, with strong imagery like the healing sextant. A minor repetitive loop occurs at the turning point ("I heard a pin strike stone. At that moment a pin is heard..."), which stalls momentum momentarily. Otherwise, the line-level craft is polished and rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is dense and evocative, though it occasionally leans into overwriting with stacked metaphors ("warmed her fingers like breath held too long"). The rhythm is hypnotic but relies heavily on "X of Y" constructions (Loom of Catalysis, pockets of paper bark). Line-level polish is high, with no obvious friction, though the density slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, but marred by occasional overwriting ("guilt can be louder than footsteps") and mixed metaphors. The line-level craft is competent but leans on "therapy-speak" labels to convey emotion rather than grounding it in physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("lantern light trembling," "proof that memory could be edible"), but the opening paragraph relies on static summary and state-of-being verbs ("was," "had shifted"). This scaffolded setup slightly delays the immediacy of the active scene.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is high-density and evocative, with strong rhythmic control and striking imagery like "auroras crawled like slow ink." A single phrase, "fingertips of his mind," leans slightly toward the abstract/purple, preventing a perfect score, but the overall line-level craft is exceptional and free of artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally vivid with strong sensory details ("lanterns rocked like tired fireflies"). However, the use of explicit list-like transitions ("First false start...", "Second false start...") triggers a scaffold penalty, creating a checklist feel that disrupts the otherwise immersive flow.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and evocative imagery ("history trying to remember itself"). The phrase "terrestrially cosmic gravity" is slightly heavy with modifiers, but the surrounding prose carries it well. No scaffold or text artifacts disrupt the flow, and the sensory descriptions are visceral and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is polished but suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density ("sealed tight like bottles of dawn," "glitter like frozen music," "like a tooth knocked loose"). These ornamental flourishes clutter the high-pressure beats, slowing narrative momentum and distancing the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmic, with strong image density ("aligning torn fibers like veins") that supports the tone. The writing maintains momentum without scaffolding artifacts, successfully balancing exposition with forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose features striking imagery, such as the iceberg being a "slow blue archive" and light spilling "like fish beneath ice." However, the writing occasionally overwrites, relying on dense adjective-noun pairings like "muted vigor" that feel forced. The rhythm is generally good, though the heavy use of metaphorical language in the climax slightly obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high-information imagery like "ribs flexed like bark" and "slow oven." The text avoids scaffolding, maintaining propulsion, though the final insertion of the tonal phrase feels slightly mechanical in its syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished but suffers from repetitive sentence structures ("Hassan admits... Mrs. Ibarra admits..."; "Hassan hears... Mrs. Ibarra hears...") that create a mechanical cadence. Some phrasing leans purple ("paint the color of sunrise"), and the density is occasionally diluted by these stylistic flourishes.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose density is high with evocative phrasing like "scabbed with coral" and "clack like familiar syllables," creating a strong rhythm. A few metaphors lean toward the abstract ("cold as diagnosis"), but the line-level craft is generally polished and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("sweet rot," "sounds like light"), creating a strong sensory experience without wasted motion. The sentence-level craft effectively supports the magical realist tone without lapsing into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with high information density. Phrases like "mapping silence" and "smoothed hush" effectively evoke the magic system. Minor deductions for occasional adjectival density ("soft snowfall of blank petals," "tranquil blaze") which teeter on the edge of overwriting, though they remain legible and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and fresh imagery ("meteors stitched white seams," "handle worn smooth by long thumbs"). There are no visible artifacts or scaffold sentences; the prose is propulsive and textured. The metaphor density is high but fits the established voice and genre without becoming purple.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by the verbatim repetition of distinctive phrases ("tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve") within a short space. These repetitions read like prompt-checking artifacts rather than intentional motifs, slightly breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally evocative and dense, but the insertion of the required phrase "as stalactites drip" creates a jarring tense clash (present tense "drip" against past tense narrative) in two separate instances. This recurring grammatical artifact disrupts the otherwise polished rhythm. Without this specific mechanical flaw, the score would be significantly higher.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from register drift; "progressive disclosure" reads as a computing/legal term that clashes with the "moon bone" aesthetic. Additionally, some descriptions ("reed-blown melancholy") tilt toward purple prose, prioritizing sound over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lyrical and information-dense, with strong imagery ("slump into itself," "rise like breath"). Occasional phrasing ambiguity ("sank her diving suit") momentarily disorients, but the style is polished.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose has a strong rhythmic quality, but is marred by forced adjectival stacks ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity") and occasional filter verbs ("Ren... noticed"). The density of imagery is high, though sometimes ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong imagery ("bones under sand"). The sentences have good rhythm and propel the story forward without unnecessary scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is marred by the verbatim repetition of the phrase "fragmented radio frequencies" (three times) and "variant allegiance," creating a stitched, artifact-like rhythm. High metaphor density occasionally clogs the momentum, making the text feel overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is rhythmically strong and image-dense, though occasionally filters experience ("he felt," "he imagined"). The specific phrase "positively wistful" feels slightly awkward and shoehorned, disrupting the otherwise smooth fable register.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("air tasted of metal and winter apples"), but suffers from "simile churn." The frequent use of "like" or "as if" constructions (appearing nearly every few sentences) creates a patterned artifact that draws attention to the writing rather than the scene. Reducing this scaffold would significantly sharpen the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high density of summary and passive construction ("was born," "was meant to"). The reliance on diagnostic telling ("purpose is born from a fault in her blood") instead of concrete action stifles narrative momentum and leaves the reader observing the story from a great distance.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and atmospheric, with strong rhythm and sensory specificity ("sliding through her earpiece like oil"). There is a slight tendency toward breathless sentence structures that stack multiple clauses, but the momentum generally holds. The integration of prompt phrases is smooth, though "fortified it with facts" is a visible pivot for the required tone.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("spring barrels like lungs"), driving the narrative without stalling. The integration of required phrases is mostly seamless, though the repetition of "aptly deliberate" is noticeable; however, it serves a structural purpose in mirroring the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with imagery ("stubborn coin," "disciplined chaos") that advances the story without dragging. Sentence variety is strong, and the writing avoids scaffold, though a few phrases ("sad puddle") skirt the edge of being overly precious.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is exceptional—dense, rhythmic, and free of wasted motion. Images like "threads look like roads" and "dissolve into zeroes" act as micro-settings that charge the narrative. The line-level craft supports the story’s density, managing a complex backstory and plot within a compact word count without feeling rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is competent but leans toward abstraction ("stitched light to shadow"), obscuring the physical reality of the climax. The repetition of the "weighted breath" motif creates a minor loop artifact, and the metaphor density in the stitching sequence slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is rhythmically strong and dense with imagery ("ribs expand as if they remembered breathing"). There is a slight tendency toward simile stacking in high-pressure beats ("coughed like a patient"), but the overall control is high.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong with evocative imagery like "shadows look steeped in honey." The score is limited by the forced integration of required phrases that clash with the sensory focus, creating rhythmic stumbles in an otherwise polished text.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("meaning gather like dew," "ribs under skin"), maintaining a high level of craft. A handful of filter verbs ("Iri saw," "Iri felt," "Iri recognized") slightly distance the reader in moments that could be more immediate, preventing a perfect score, but the imagery is otherwise exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sentence-level craft ("curves began to answer curves"). While generally effective, it occasionally slips into decorative telling ("earnest whimsy") that softens the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, dense, and rhythmically controlled, fitting the "overgrown" aesthetic well. A slight over-reliance on simile structures ("like ink," "as if," "like letters") is the only artifact preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like &quot;future had coughed through him&quot; and &quot;scavenger eyes.&quot; The rhythm is generally strong, though there is a slight tendency toward repetitive sentence structures (Subject-Verb openings) that creates a fable-like, but somewhat static, cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("skittering around the dial like a trapped comet") that advances the narrative without scaffold. The rhythm of the sentences matches the tension of the scene, and there are no significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong verbs like "hushes into its highest ward." However, it occasionally slips into sentimental abstraction or overwrought metaphor ("jagged as a shard of night," "scratches like tender confessions") that softens the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, achieving high information density without clutter or scaffolding. Images like shadows "folded and stacked like letters never delivered" are striking and thematically precise. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the protagonist's deliberate pacing, creating a seamless marriage of form and content.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative, with high-quality line work. There is a slight reliance on summary in the middle section ("He went back to the riverbank at dusk...") which flattens the momentum compared to the scenic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high-quality imagery like "sealed ink" and "morning on water." A few required phrases feel slightly welded on (e.g., the specific collocation "reflectively vibrant"), but the overall line-level craft supports the story's gentle momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Imagery is vivid ("servers lay like tombstones"), but technical polish slips with missing hyphens ("leak shaped") and vague objects ("server foil"). The prose density is high, though occasionally crowded with metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic ("ink rising to her knees like doubt"), but suffers from occasional preciousness ("thimble full of laughter," "bank of broken metaphors"). These metaphors draw attention to the writing itself rather than the image, slightly dulling the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("sap rose like applause"). The line-level craft is solid, free of major mechanical errors or distracting artifacts. A few phrases lean toward the precious ("small jars of captured starlight"), but the density of image and action remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("stars bit into the surface like teeth"). The rhythm is well-managed, though there is a slight tendency toward noun-phrase clusters ("spiral of spoons around a lens-eye") that slows the pace.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythm and high information density ("surfaces were not only metal; they were sound, light"). The line-level craft successfully balances poetic abstraction with concrete mechanical details, avoiding scaffold and maintaining momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("light did not spread so much as sink"). However, the metaphor "kelp reads tide" slips into mixed agency (kelp reacts; it does not decode), and the required adverb "boundary-lessly" creates a rhythmic stumble in an otherwise polished sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    High-quality density is marred by a significant redundancy artifact in the opening sentence ("skylight of the loft, a rain-beaded skylight loft, with beads") which creates a stuttering rhythm. Additionally, the closing simile ("ember refusing to die") relies on stock phrasing that weakens the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    The writing is dense and evocative, with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. Phrasing is original ("tomorrow as a bruise"). A slight reliance on adjective-noun pairings in the opening ("resolute scavenger," "kinetic lagoon," "deliberate spirals") creates a heavy texture, but the rhythm smooths out significantly once the action begins.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong images like the "blank oceans" on the tile map. The writing is dense and propulsive, though the final sentence drifts into aphorism rather than narrative closure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong imagery ("faint comma on the wet stone") is undercut by repetition of the phrase "glacial hush" (three times) and the awkward noun-phrase insertion of "petrichor nostalgia." These artifacts, along with some interpretive scaffolding, clutter the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally competent with some strong imagery, but marred by clunky prompt insertions like "serene upheaval ran through her." Some sentences drift into purple description ("held breath," "fingerprints of stories") that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.0)
    Imagery is dense and evocative ("sentence without paper"), but the phrase "infinitely patient" repeats verbatim in a short space, creating a distracting template artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and no visible scaffolding artifacts. Figurative language ("hedges swallowing their own shadows," "wet with leaf decay") is functional and consistent, effectively charging the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is polished and high-density, with strong rhythmic variation and evocative imagery ("fragile as a held breath"). The repetition of the prompt phrase "hypothesizing about everything" is handled smoothly, integrating it into the sentence flow without feeling forced. There are no distracting artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is polished but suffers from "purple" abstraction and mixed metaphors ("grafted into light"). The text relies on stated emotions rather than evoked sensations, reducing the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose quality is high, with strong imagery and rhythm ("opened like an eyelid," "stacked like skulls") and no distracting artifacts. The sentence-level craft supports the atmospheric density without sacrificing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, balancing high-concept imagery ("turning thought into teeth") with clear, propulsive syntax. There are no visible artifacts or scaffold sentences; every line deepens character, setting, or plot. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the "quiet sigh" and "rotation" central to the story.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is weakened by heavy reliance on telling and forced phrasing ("throbbed in him like calm thunder") that disrupts clarity. The repeated insertion of required phrases ("fiercely meditative," "thundering calm") creates palpable artifacts that mar the rhythm and logic.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is high-density and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("shame turning like a key"). The sentences propel the narrative forward efficiently. A few phrases lean slightly toward the purple ("searing reverie"), but overall the line-level craft supports the story's weight and momentum effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery, avoiding scaffold loops. Some metaphors border on overwriting ("statue rubbed warm," "velveteen gloom"), but the line-level craft generally supports the atmospheric intent without hindering readability.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose quality is high, with excellent density and striking metaphors like "numbers that felt like bones warmed in her pocket." The writing is precise and evocative, avoiding scaffold, though the density occasionally slows the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from "simileitis," with nearly every description relying on "like" or "as" constructions ("like snow," "like fish," "like seeds"). Additionally, a repetitive artifact appears with "thistle"—used to describe pain ("pricked like thistles") and then immediately reused for "thistled calm" and "calm as a thistle," creating a confusing mixed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative, but significant grammatical slips mar the execution. Tense shifts occur at key moments ("she weaves truth" in a past-tense narrative; "chair finally slows... inspectors left"), breaking the timeline's logic. These artifacts are jarring in an otherwise polished piece and trigger the heavy line-level debt penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery like "opened like a throat." Rhythm varies well to support tension. A few similes lean slightly abstract ("sharp as a fresh decision"), but the line-level control is high and free of distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose flow is generally smooth, but the integration of prompt phrases like "across unlearning hatred" results in awkward syntax. Abstract constructions ("absence disguised as efficiency") occasionally clutter the sentence logic, though the rhythm is well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is evocative, with strong sensory pairings like "tasted of regret and diagrams," though the syntax relies heavily on repetitive subject-verb openers ("She planted," "She fed," "She pruned"). The insertion of technical phrasing like "synaptic plasticity" creates a slight tonal clash with the established "old iron" and "grandmother's wisdom" aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically strong, with high information density and no wasted scaffolding. Figurative language is generally excellent ("tiny bridge," "trapped fireflies"), though the personification of the sap ("softened as if shamed") strains the physical logic slightly. The imagery consistently serves the story’s dual nature of machine and myth.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("compact quiet that burned gently"), showing strong command of rhythm. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward slightly twee personification ("tables are thinking," "streetlights daydream"), but the line-level craft is generally high-quality and propulsion is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("bubbles stumbling," "fountain... throat trying to speak"), driving momentum. The description of the ampoule is slightly modifier-heavy ("foxglove-stained glass... color of bruised twilight"), but the overall line-level craft is precise and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly evocative, with lines like "repeated like a thought you could not finish" doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. The metaphor of numbers as lockpicks and assumptions as quarry is sustained without becoming strained. The writing is economical, with no wasted motion or filter artifacts to slow the pacing. The sentence-level craft supports the story's breathless, infinite logic.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("drifted up like seeds"), but suffers from a density of simile constructions (using "like" six times) that can feel repetitive. The line-level craft is generally high, but the figurative language sometimes draws attention away from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic ("chronology could keep the ceilings from cracking"). A few stock phrases ("insects in amber," "stomach twist") and filter verbs ("she saw," "she watched") dull the immediacy of the observation in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("teeth of stone," "drank the room's shadows"). The density of metaphor is high, occasionally bordering on overwrought ("slow exhale," "strangled," "verdict"), but generally serves the fable-like tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("moonlight filtered through spoiled milk"). The integration of required phrases is mostly smooth, though "unbosom" creates a slight register bump that is absorbed by the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive, handling the high-concept imagery with clarity ("fruit thudding like drumbeats"). While "fractal generating" feels slightly technical for the otherwise elemental lexicon, the line-level craft creates a strong, immersive texture that supports the story's "restless euphony."

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A few similes lean towards the ornamental ("rust flakes fall like burnt petals"), but the line-level craft generally supports the "sunwashed dread" tone well. Information density is high, moving the story efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose features strong imagery but suffers from some cliché phrasing ("building policies on sand," "reopen old wounds"). Additionally, the heavy use of reported speech leads to repetitive sentence structures (S-V-O patterns) in the middle section that flatten the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high-quality imagery ("ink has survived like a secret ember"). The writing sustains the dreamlike tension without sacrificing clarity during the action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong sensory verbs and efficient pacing. "Velvet rot" and "page exhaled" are evocative, though "dappled resolve" reads as a slightly forced modifier that creates a minor semantic stumble in an otherwise concrete sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("bite light cleanly," "stained dawn"), with strong rhythm and no wasted words. The figurative language supports the magical atmosphere without obscuring clarity or falling into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery like "clouds rolled under us like bruises." The phrasing is generally propulsive, though the repetition of the prompt phrase "intangibly tangible" feels slightly mechanical in an otherwise fluid text. The technical lexicon ("waveguide," "first order corrections") is used correctly to ground the more abstract elements.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose quality is high, with excellent information density and vivid figurative language (“dusk leaked... like ink poured onto paper”). The writing has strong rhythm and propulsion, avoiding empty scaffolding, though the metaphorical density occasionally borders on ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in every sentence. A few metaphors border on overwrought (e.g., "sliding into minds with the ease of moonlight"), but the "fish bone" watch hand and "sieved hush" imagery provide strong, original anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative, but the opening sentence contains a significant redundancy ("Mist stitched the storm-worn windblown parapet in mist") that creates an immediate stumble. A few adjective stacks ("storm-worn windblown") lack rhythmic polish. However, lines like "chains chimed softly" and "bodies like coins" demonstrate strong imagery that recovers momentum after the hook.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally high-quality with strong imagery. Some phrasing feels slightly manufactured to fit prompt requirements (e.g., the direct placement of &quot;merrily melancholic&quot;), but the rhythm and density are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and strong sentence variety. A few phrases feel slightly forced ("delicately robust" reads as an awkward oxymoron), but the line-level craft generally supports the story's momentum without stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and dense with imagery, but leans heavily on "as if" similes and filter verbs ("She feels the truth," "she realizes"). Greater immediacy in the emotional beats—showing the weight of gravity rather than stating she feels it like gravity—would sharpen the execution.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and evocative, maintaining strong momentum. A recurring reliance on "like/as" simile constructions ("like a seed," "like a river delta," "like lungs") creates a slight rhythmic monotony that holds back the highest mark.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and image-rich, with standout lines like "refusing the brittle AI that once indexed grief." However, some metaphors feel slightly strained or overwrought (e.g., "joy were a helium lung," "candle ghosts"), creating density that occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but overly dense with figurative language, often stacking metaphors ("pulses wrote soft equations," "prophecy had grown wings") in a way that obscures the physical reality of the scene. This "purple" tendency reduces the immediacy of the danger and creates a rhythmic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and no significant scaffolding artifacts. Phrases like "listened for teeth" and "moved like ink across paper" show strong command of imagery and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong, with evocative imagery like "silent sheets" and "borrowed dawn" creating a cohesive mood. The prose flows well, though the description of the dust forming a legible word strains visual credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. However, filter verbs ("I saw," "I realized") distance the reader at pivotal moments, and the required phrases ("furiously tranquil") feel inserted rather than organic to the sentence flow.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is distinct and rhythmically controlled, with high information density and strong imagery ("clash rang like a cymbal," "hiss of valves"). The writing avoids scaffolding and maintains momentum throughout the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical density that occasionally obscures logic (e.g., smuggling poems in "returned mugs" from a break room to solitary feels logistically dubious). The reliance on poetic summary over concrete action creates a static rhythm that lacks narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished and evocative ("bright as bone," "aimed like a flare"), creating a strong atmospheric rhythm. A few phrases lean toward the melodramatic or alliterative ("rats and regrets," "snapped as cleanly as his promises"), which feels slightly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense and evocative, though there is a slight logical friction in Tavo claiming to distrust the elders' instruction to use dreams while immediately using a notebook of dreams as a "different instrument." Aside from this momentary stumble, the imagery and rhythm are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong with good rhythm ("salt wind rifled my hair"), but suffers from occasional overwriting. Phrases like "rain pearls" and the pathetic fallacy of apologizing gulls detract slightly from the otherwise precise imagery. The prompt elements are integrated smoothly.

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and physics-true: “humidity curled the torn leaves as if each plant was exhaling a small apology” performs apology without purple. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“pinned,” “scattered,” “tightened”). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges “stars cooled by listening” with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevated diction—“lacework maps,” “crystallized final moment”—stays within the artisan’s lexicon and does not clot the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, heat, or choice. Figurative language is sparse, surgical—“missing tooth” for the empty slot—never clutters high-pressure beats. Paragraph lengths breathe with the thermal tide, accelerating during calibration test, lengthening at final glow. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges frost/heat polarity.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: opening spondees (“tide seems pause”) give way to liquid anapests that mimic underwater drift. Information density is high—one sentence often does three jobs: “Light bursts, not whole but workable, and it threads through the stacks, stitching catalog numbers onto drifting bones” advances plot, image, and theme. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the maritime archive conceit without contradiction. Minor filter verbs appear (“I understand”) but are justified by the brass receiver’s translation moment and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and apt (“soft as a spoon on glass”). Information density high: one line often does scene-work and metaphor simultaneously. Clean grammar; pronouns track.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density—each sentence layers image, breath, and emotional stakes; figurative language is selective, never clogs the peak beat, and the final flare sentence propels the release without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or choice. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “syrupy air” and “bark of time” extend the vegetal logic. One paraphrase loop (“the maze was smaller, simpler, more humane”) could have been cut. No artifacts touch the closure beat, so 9+ remains open.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from short ash-fall beats to longer chained clauses without drumbeat repetition. Figurative language is sparse, high-yield: “hollow note answers her knuckle” does two jobs—sound and confession. Zero paraphrase loops; each detail (copper foil, numbered keys) either advances cipher or barricade. One typo—“benches latch” needs apostrophe—does not blur closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “She fed it charcoal mixed with the gray dust of ruined hull planks” seeds setting, process, and metaphor in one breath. Occasional adjective clusters (“battered marvel of the greenhouse”) flirt with purple but never stall momentum; no loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and world data (“glass hummed faintly whenever it neared iron or oath”). Figurative load is high but patterned early, so closure beat (“tore the portrait in half”) lands with stark clarity against prior shimmer. No scaffold loops; only one near-paraphrase (“luminous disbelief”) recurs. Clean grammar, precise pronouns, varied paragraph rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high density: each sentence advances image or decision. Figurative language is selective—ice “exhaled,” consoles “like ribs”—never clotted. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One minor register lift: “conceptual repricing” idea risks abstraction, but it is earned by concrete glass/bookmark fusion. No artifacts in final third; closure image remains luminous and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: charcoal rubbing “like a gravestone” does triple duty (tactile, gothic, death motif). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—moths as shredded film—without purple stacking. One minor scaffold: “the certainty that trembled in my chest” is abstract; could compress to “my chest shook with certainty.” Closure line is clean, strong verb—“stepped into a future that I authored.”

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty—image plus conceptual reweighting—without scaffold: “the gilding lift and run in threads” simultaneously shows ruin and enacts the theme of erasure. Metaphors are coherent within the maritime-starchart lexicon; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“the way you trace a coast / the way fear tightened”) is minor and does not recur at closure. Filter verbs are scarce; when used (“I felt the ambered hush”) they serve immediacy. A single overripe phrase—“ambered hush that sealed sound like resin seals a dead insect”—flirts with purple, but the image is earned by prior pattern, so penalty stays modest.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“sound was a thin line of light”—and never clusters to stall momentum. Information density is high: each sentence sweeps forward character, image, or concept. Only one paraphrase-adjacent line (“questions still rose like dust motes”) but it is anchored in J-17’s cleaning ontology and does not recur.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or causality. Figurative language sparse and precise—“sheet of crushed crystal,” “ghostly images that could not hide”—never clogs the climax. Strong verbs (gleamed, whispered, sharpened) replace modifiers. Rhythm modulates with tension: longer cadence for surveillance, staccato for revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay vegetal and coherent—“dying vine curling back on itself.” Sentence variety propels the night walk without drumbeat. One clause (“because in a measurable world the tiny wins…”) edges toward aphorism but is earned by prior concrete ledger. Clean copy, zero artifacts in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “Frost filmed the observation dome, yet radiator grids under the floor gave the corridors an icy warmth” does three jobs in one line. No synonym loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“lung holding its breath”—but it is taught early and echoed by glider sigh, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—one sentence often carries image, motion, and metaphor—but occasional stacked qualifiers (“shallow pool under the stage… broken panels… in between space”) slightly dilute immediacy in the inciting beat; no loops or mixed metaphors touch the closure, so momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates from fevered cadence to spare confession without template repetition. Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—wind through spruce, graphite fog—each image reappears to reweight meaning. No paraphrase loops; every sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Proofing is clean; pronouns track flawlessly through the two-character scene.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Every sentence carries double duty: sensory + stakes or metaphor + causality. No scaffold, no loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into the ghost bay then exhales with the final turn. A single hairline slip—“the tunnel breathed” is borderline personification—but it pays off via valve causality, so barely grazes the 9+ ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; figurative language is selective, never stacked in high-pressure beats. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. “Spores bloom on parchment” does triple duty: image, theme, closure—high density without purple. Minor tic: repeated “drift of untold seasons” phrasing, not quite loop.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; no filter-verb stacks, no adjacent paraphrase. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (sound metaphors) so the eclipse climax stays clear.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; no template runs. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“silence settled like bronze dust,” “shadows… like searching animals”—and paid off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with action: long sentences while baking, staccato while shutters click. No synonym loops; “beam,” “flash,” “strip” retain precise referents. Metaphors are spare—“lighthouse like a single white tooth”—and never layered to clutter. Information density high: one sentence often does setting, character beat, and causal link.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—cloth-over-bell, thread-by-thread—taught early and coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stake or texture. One mixed metaphor—“unraveled stillness” is abstract, but immediately grounded by rewoven-by-stranger image. No artifacts in closure beat; final pause is earned, not overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax, propelling the quiet ascent; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is dense but patterned—spiral ridges as “score,” horizon as “seam”—and never muddies causality. The final paragraph’s clause rhythms mimic the conducted silence, achieving textual music without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the script were reading her back” does double duty—image + stakes. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances choice or atmosphere.

Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences vary from fluid cadence to staccato under stress; no template churn. Metaphors are spare and physically grounded: “breath held too long,” “gray pollen.” Information density is high—each sentence advances stakes or texture. Zero paraphrase loops; the single potential scaffold—“the same blank stare from her students and from herself”—is justified as iterative symptom of the parasite.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “chlorine mixed with rotting grain, a layered tranquility that tried to pass as safety” advances smell, irony, and theme in one stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and clause to mimic inhalation/exhalation; no scaffold loops. Figurative layer—“crystal shadows,” “green tongues curled out”—is selective and tied to stakes. Information density high: one sentence often does setting, emotion, and causality. No mixed metaphors or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances stakes or texture—“their presence bent minutes into elastic loops” simultaneously world-builds and escalates. Figurative language is selective, never crowding a single beat. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn appear; rope, knots, layers recur with evolving function. Final paragraph slows rhythm to match the poet’s relinquished urgency, earning the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective—“hush bends,” “silence has shape”—and never clusters into purple. One mixed metaphor risk: “knot…twine around her wrist” is tactile but quickly resolved into sonic strand, so clarity holds. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm modulates with the unbinding, culminating in the single unashamed laugh.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense but never purple: each image does double duty (amber as both beauty and terminal clock). No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative logic stays coherent—static electricity as lie-detector is maintained without mixed metaphors. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“I could hear… I could have sold”) appears mid-scene, not in closure beat, so 9+ remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “the sea had learned to whisper words” does triple duty (setting, atmosphere, POV bias). No filler loops; each sentence advances chain or character. Figurative control maintained—metaphors (storm vs stranger, tidewater urge) stay maritime-consistent. Clean grammar, strong verbs, purposeful paragraph breaks. One hairline slip: “cautious exuberance” is repeated descriptor, but it is motif-linked, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances map, reed, or kin pressure. Figurative layer is spare—only “wound trying to heal” risks purple but earns its place by reframing crater shimmer under council fire. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final arbor scene, then lands on the single-line declaration “asked to be named… as maker.”

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “boats slid there instead of streets” does world, stakes, and image in seven words. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative layer is controlled—metaphors extend the musical frame (smith-shaped sound, suspended bar). One mixed image (“silver ribbon laid on stone”) is minor; it never muddies causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language patterned (triangles, coordinates, bridge) without purple overload. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) justified by conjurer’s mindset. One near-mixed metaphor (“heart like scattered seeds” vs. “dovetail”) but clarity intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level density is high—nouns double as tools, verbs as stealth actions. Figurative control keeps metaphors sensory (tape “jagged as a crescent”) and consistent.

No mixed vehicles, no filter-verb stacks; final image is uncluttered, letting the shard’s warmth do the metaphorical lift.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “roots tasting minerals” fuses body and botany in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Metaphors stay vegetal—no mixed vehicles—and climax in the root-tongue image. A single filter-verb cluster (“she realized… she understood… she began to suspect”) slightly dulls the peak beat; trim would push 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies; strong verbs (“breathed,” “thresh,” “exhaled”) replace modifiers. Occasional poetic layering (“gray hour before dawn,” “skin of retreating water”) but never clogs causality. One paraphrase loop: “rain trails…led me…following rain trails again” in adjacent clauses costs −0.2. Otherwise clean, no mixed metaphor; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but patterned: “overlapping shadows” recurs with accruing menace, never looped. Metaphors stay physical—“sky full of invisible birds”—and don’t crowd high-pressure beats. One clause drifts toward loftiness (“bright darkness was the surest way to listen”) yet serves theme; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: cumulative anaphora (“then fourteen, then twenty-one”) mirrors tidal spacing; no template cadence. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—sound as reef, ledger as chart.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “colors...trying to remember another spectrum” advances both physics and mood. Figurative language is selective, never piled in high-stress beats. No loops or scaffold; pronouns track cleanly through spatial contortions. One mixed moment—“pressure change between angles”—is minor; clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with beats: short percussive moves during agent confrontation, liquid cadences when ink bleeds. Figurative layer is selective—ink “liquefies rigid thinking,” tag “a verb that could happen to him”—each metaphor earns its keep and recurs. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines are mirror-polished without sounding engineered. A single near-repeat of “priced” is the only hairline blemish.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and conceptual work without scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“pages pressed together,” “incandescent restraint”—and avoids clutter in peak beats.

    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the port fed on forgetting” compresses institutional critique into six words. No loops or scaffold; figurative vehicles stay coherent (sound-as-textile, tide-as-eraser). One near-mixed metaphor—“paper bite like a warning with teeth”—is vivid enough to pass.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “He stroked a string that was not yet tightened, and the instrument answered with a low hum” advances action, conveys tactile specificity, and launches the voices motif. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor (compass needle “flashed and vanished when he blinked”) is used once and built upon, not repeated. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-driven. A single mixed vehicle—“seconds folded like paper” beside “building listened”—is permissible under lyric license and does not fog causality.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; most sentences do two jobs (“translating customs so fights did not start over a wrong hand sign or song”). Occasional scaffold: “she owed… yet she owed” is deliberate parallelism, not churn. One metaphor mix: “tightrope above the music” is vivid, but “hope rise and panic chase it” borders cliché. No loops or filter stacks in the closure beat; the final mural line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)

No synonym loops or scaffold; information density is high (one sentence often does description, interior, and stakes). One minor filter-verb cluster “she thought of the lone sand grain” could be trimmed, but it does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “water spilling from each link like beads from Lio’s channel” does triple duty (image, rhythm, thematic echo).

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; rhythm breathes with scene tempi, no template cadence. High density—each line advances map, bone, or interior—yet remains clear.

    Sentences carry double duty: “She followed the central aisle until the orchard’s trunk rose from the altar, a pear tree rooted in cracked marble” advances plot, anchors space, and supplies tool resource. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles stay agricultural (orchard, bark, wax) without collision. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from iambic cadence of trespass to staccato of improvised surgery.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative layering (“constellations like fruit”) is selective, never clotted. No loops or scaffold; information dual-purposed. One mixed image: “brightened disquiet” is abstract, but fits tone. Minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction appears in narration, yet aligns with curator mindset. Closure beat remains clear and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “the act of naming loosened a spell that had pinched the corridor shut” advances plot, image, and theme in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the musical-bookstore logic. Minor filter verb (“she realized”) appears once at climax but does not stall momentum. Opening and closing lines book-end with sonic imagery, creating purposeful envelope.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; metaphor density is high but patterned early (“rusted halo,” “paint itself forgot”) so it reads as taught texture rather than ornament overload. Occasional cadence echo (“names grew on tags beneath leaves”) risks loop, yet each image advances knowledge or stakes. One mixed vehicle—“unchkindled solace, warm only in imagination”—slips into abstraction, but the closing line re-anchors motion: “the drifting ship finally chose a direction.”

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances gear, hand, or meaning. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“red moon” seal, “listening hush”—never clotted. Strong verbs (unweave, exhale, crystallize) propel without adverb clutter. Final line lands with cadence shift that signals closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm modulates: long resonance-building clauses build to short strikes—“she placed the stone.” Figurative density is high but patterned, taught early, and paid off in the final net of echoes. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. A single filter-verb cluster (“she understood that if she could redirect…”) is minor enough to keep the 9-band in reach.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with ascent and ignition—long sentences for vigil, clipped fragments for alignment turns; figurative language is spare and grounded (“healed scar” of rainbow code), avoiding purple drift; only minor scaffold (“the moment I…”) repeats twice, not enough to dull the final beam image.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but propulsive: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work without paraphrase loops. Metaphors are coherent—fog as stone slabs, nostalgia as compass—and never mixed. One minor scaffold: “the hush in the air deepened as if the observatory were drawing a long breath” slightly repeats the prior “hush” beat. No artifacts touch the closure image; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from drum-beat chant to flowing river-sentence; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “sky a lid of soot-gray cloud” does dual duty as weather and emotional lid. Information density is high—every sentence advances fuse logic or social pressure. One mixed metaphor (“hope fell heavier than stone”) is minor amid otherwise clean vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—two similes total, both tide-linked. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks. High information density: one sentence often advances image, stakes, and metaphor simultaneously. Final line earns cadence shift without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences multi-task: “silence thickened around its porcelain body, gathering like light on glaze” advances atmosphere and tactile outcome. No synonym loops or template cadence; openings vary. One mixed metaphor—“sprout upward as if the world had turned into soil”—is justified by gravity inversion and does not blur causality. Clean proofing; pronouns track.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—needles, vaulted chamber—and pays off in final wind image without clutter. Information density high: one sentence often does setting, character tool, and emotional filter (“He latched…felt the first duty…”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor alliteration (“vaulting hush”) reads intentional, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose shows rhythmic variety and high density: “ruby flake bled a red sheen that made the older pigments flare” does triple sensory job. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (waterfall as radio static). One near-miss: “city receded in neon reflections” is generic, but it occupies a transitional beat, not the closure. Line-level artifacts do not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is dense yet breathable: “starlight spilled into the chapel like water into a sinking boat” does triple duty (image, stakes, foreshadow). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. One near-mixed metaphor—“wet ash through cracks”—is forgiven because ash is already established as tactile wall matter. Final paragraph cadence slows to match exhausted dawn, sealing momentum cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose achieves high density: “the promises hardened into real, chalky bricks on her tongue” performs metaphor, backstory, and sensory cost in one stroke. Rhythm modulates from long fungal aisles sentences to staccato glitch fragments without mechanical repetition. No synonym churn or filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong—“pressurized,” “stitched,” “reefed.” Occasional elevated diction (“quantum promise,” “conceptual pressure”) is justified by the speculative rule-set taught on page. Closure line “bright enough to share” lands clean, without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“bridge sketched in ash”—never clutters high-pressure beats. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Information density high: one sentence often advances plot, mood, and image. Copy clean; no tense drift. Closure sentence breathes perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet limpid: “a factually mystical certainty rose in him, like counting that also sings” compresses epistemology and euphoria in one image. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances setting, character, or causality. Mixed metaphors are absent; vehicles stay coherent (knots → patterns → armor → compass). One hairline slip—“spring and graves together” edges toward oxymoron—but the context justifies the alchemical fusion, so deduction is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences do double duty—description advances plot, no scaffold. One paraphrase loop (“small kindnesses” echoed in narration and dialogue) is minor enough to leave closure untouched. Metaphors are precise: button crack as “lightning vein,” grief shifting “from weight into lens.” No mixed vehicles or purple stacks. Copy is clean; pronoun reference unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the night-time chase without algorithmic patterns. Figurative language is selective—auric lagoon, gold code, door in chest—each image reappears to charge the climax, avoiding decorative overload. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every clause advances stakes, sensory grounding, or tactic. One near-miss: “starlight braid with the lagoon’s gold” borders on purple, but the next clause snaps back to actionable tracing, preserving clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful; mixed metaphors (“postcards drifted across water”) are brief and licensed by dream-logic. Rhythm modulates with escalating dewdrops, propelling toward final hush. One paraphrase loop—“silence that felt like home and loss at once”—could compress, but it does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “leaves fell in patterns like handwriting” compresses world-rule, stakes, and beauty into one image. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. One mixed metaphor—“the spiral loosened into letters as if embarrassed”—is forgiven because the pathetic fallacy aligns with the tree’s story-hunger. Filter verbs are absent; action is pinned to concrete verbs: scraped, prodded, sighed.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “roots hung like dark hair.” Information density high—each clause advances image or stakes. No artifacts obscure the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances knowledge or stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphor chains (“silver water,” “luminous regret”) stay coherent. One strained image—“missing tooth” for coin blank—momentarily trips the physical logic of a flat face. Otherwise rhythm breathes with beats, and the final line lands without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative control keeps vehicles consistent—sound as liquid (“poured down,” “brush her face like cold rain”)—without mixed-metaphor clutter. High information density: “lantern unlit” signals night, humility, and tool in three syllables. Rhythm modulates from long breathless confession lines to the staccato laugh crack, propelling closure without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm accelerates with memory flashes, then lengthens during the equation reading, mirroring cardiac cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned—metal, sap, bruise, pollen—each returning to charge the final image; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold spot: “feeling displaced rooted at once” could lose “at once,” but the line still propels. No loops, no synonym churn; information density stays high without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from long breathless climbs to short pulses (“Cold light breathed up”) without algorithmic pattern. No loops or mixed metaphors; every image either advances setting or refracts light, sustaining momentum to the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances observation or atmosphere. Metaphors stay physical—“lint on my sleeves,” “slow metallic sigh”—avoiding purple overload. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor filter verb cluster around “I felt” could trim two instances, but immediacy remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—glass, frost, ink—each recharged at closure. Information density high: one sentence often sets scene, reveals motive, and advances action. Zero scaffolding; no artifacts in final third. Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and stress; strong verbs (“scrape the asteroid’s ornamented hull like a bow on tarnished brass”) propel. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks. Mixed metaphors absent. One scaffold risk—“visible time” repeated three times in 40 words—barely touches closure. Information density high; each clause adds stakes or texture.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong auditory and tactile specificity; sentences vary in length and openers. No loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevate—“headache of quiet” pushes abstract—but metaphor coherence holds. Information density high; every clause advances image or tool-use. Minor scaffold in “midnight itself stole the city’s light” could trim, yet propulsion never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and musical yet propulsive: “cold image rises of men in oilcloth, lanterns bobbing” does three jobs—temperature, sight, motion—in six words. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; each image advances knowledge or atmosphere. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful (“she feels another awakening”) where interiority is required. Final paragraph varies rhythm with short declaratives after a long sinuous sentence, closing on the quietly hinged “open enough.”

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rain skews sideways” does triple sensory work. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, action, or decision. Metaphors stay coherent—turbine blade as crescent moon—without purple overload. Opening and closing lines book-end the arc with sonic echo (“reverie” / “repair”), earning the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “stone itself were exhaling perfume” performs double sensory duty. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Metaphors stay coherent—vines as scratches, map as breath. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“she began to reckon”) is forgivable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “envelope seal had burned my fingers with a scent of salt and smoke” does triple duty (sensory, foreshadow, stakes). Metaphors stay coherent—lagoon as “mirror so dark it seemed to drink starlight” supports closure. One paraphrase loop spotted (“the truth…like a rope pulled tight” echoes later) but it doesn’t stall the beat. No filter-verb clusters; strong verbs anchor sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). Figurative language is sparse and precise—“paper frames nested like bones”—never muddies causality. Strong verbs dominate; no filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. One minor adjective cluster (“salt rotted beams and collapsed roofs”) but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences do double duty—advance plot while layering metaphor (“the wax kept the pattern like a bruise”). No scaffold or synonym loops; each image is bespoke. One mixed metaphor—“velvet disquiet… gathers in the leaves as if the trees are eavesdropping”—but it is purposeful personification, not slippage. Opening and closing lines frame the arc with sonic imagery, giving the piece a read-aloud cadence that justifies its lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “spiral of meltwater that refused to freeze” packs world-rule, tension, and metaphor into nine words. One mixed metaphor—“time itself had been stirred and left to cool in a different shape”—is forgiven because it occurs during the corridor’s first impossible appearance. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, choice, or consequence. Final line’s “furiously tranquil” is the only repeat offender, but it is the story’s required tone tag.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with pressure; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is spare—only “dark river” for rope—so clarity stays meteorological. One mixed metaphor risk: “clouds were holding their breath” is forgiven because it’s focalized through monk belief, not authorial flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“slow-moving embers,” “ticking like bones”—never stacked in high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Information density high: one sentence often performs atmosphere + interiority + foreshadowing. Final line lands on image, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often does two jobs—“the wind carried ash that settled on my tongue like vows I never spoke” fuses sensory, metaphor, and backstory. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each slip reading is a fresh, concrete image. Figurative layering is controlled—moonlight “spills” only once, at the charged poise. Minor micro-movement clutter (“stepped backward into the scorched air”) could lose two words, but nothing obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“green light folded inward like a closing eyelid.” Information density is high: each line advances stakes, texture, or atmosphere. One minor scaffold: “time capsule slept inside” could trim “slept,” but it doesn’t dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but breathable; metaphors (“ink thinned with milk”) serve double duty—scene color plus thematic dilution. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Occasional elevated phrasing (“burnished hush”) risks purple but stays within poet-POV lexicon. Final paragraph earns its cadence release after prior propulsion; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “copper wire…coax young limbs into arches” advances action, atmosphere, and stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language sparse and precise. High information density with clean grammar; paragraph cuts tight.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from short scalpel cuts to longer accumulative clauses that mirror crystal growth; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor chemically grounded—“stones like cooled bronze” sets temperature and alloy for later door. No paraphrase loops; “microcrystals arranged like tiny ladders” is first and only comparison. One near-slip: “pattern pulsed with the regularity of a reaction clock” borders on textbook simile, but POV licenses it. Closure line is clean, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layer is dense but each metaphor (jetty as spine, horizon as scroll) serves atmosphere or choice, never ornament for its own sake. Information density high—one line often does two jobs. A single mixed echo—“vast blue dusk where the horizon feels like an unrolled scroll”—skirts purple but is earned by voice. No artifacts touch the final blossoming beat.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, world-rule, emotional tilt—without scaffold. Occasional poetic stack (“wind moved… wild hush”) risks density but pattern is taught early and pays off in mirror-reading beat. Zero loops, clear propulsion; minor purple flicker keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: information dual-loads (“window faced the experimental ring, and beyond it the constellations”) without clog. Metaphors are coherent—magnet/filings, lantern, needle—none contradict the physical logic. One paraphrase loop (“temporally stretched feeling loosened into ordinary time”) costs −0.2; otherwise zero scaffold. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to the staccato of rusted bolts, mirroring the calibration release. No artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the 9-band open.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences do double duty: “swapping hand-carved chess pieces with secrets inside as neatly as prayer beads” advances plot, image, and simile in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the ice-and-sky motif without contradiction. One near-purple line—“sky churned, as if someone were repainting it with a wet brush”—is justified by POV’s painterly thief-eye. Rhythm accelerates into short beats at the ledge, then opens into the final glide; zero scaffolding touches the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Metaphors stay coherent within gallery acoustics and chess logic; no mixed vehicles. High information density—each sentence advances tension or atmosphere. Only minor scaffold: “bundles of testimony tied with red cord” could lose “of testimony,” but artifact does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and texture, accelerating during the corridor walk; figurative language is dense but patterned—storm, scales, thunder—so it teaches its own weather system. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed vehicle—“quill prickled with cold as if holding back lightning”—slightly over-pressurises the feather, nudging off perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “snowflakes hovered like pinned notes” does double sensory-symbolic work. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances maze, tapestry, or interior calculus. Figurative language peaks at the mirrored gate then steps aside for the release image, avoiding clutter at closure. One near-purple phrase—“bright maze of metal lines that hummed with the town's captured seconds”—earns its place by becoming the literal timer she must unlock.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “the canyon air turned every whisper into a thousand answers” simultaneously world-builds and foreshadows tactic. Figurative language is selective, never stacked; mixed metaphors are avoided. One filter-verb cluster (“she began impromptu poetry sessions”) is strategically placed to slow tempo before the scattering beat. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long inhalation of opening to shard-like final exhalation without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “pour molten gold into the fracture lines of my own regret” advances plot and metaphor simultaneously. Figurative language is selective, never stacked in high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each mention of acid, gears, or pockmarks adds new information. Opening and closing lines are sonic bookends—“prayer in a dead temple” vs “clink with the turning gears”—creating purposeful cadence. Proof-level clean: no tense drift, pronoun ambiguity, or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty—action plus atmospheric data—without scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, precise (“barnacles ring the pool like a crown”) and never clutters high-pressure beats. No loops, synonym churn, or register drift. Final paragraph lands with resonant brevity; zero artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose density is high—each sentence advances atmosphere, ritual step, or sensory cue without scaffold. Figurative language is selective: “blue bone,” “exhausted anger,” never stacked in a single beat. One near-loop: “whisper can travel farther than a shout” is conceptually reprised, but the final phrasing shifts to “promise sent gently,” avoiding verbatim churn. No mixed metaphors or register drift; the tower’s mechanical tremor stays physically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythmic control mirrors moon phases—lean clauses at thin crescent, heavier cadences at full. Information density high: one sentence often layers tool, body, and sky. One paraphrase loop (“the safest passage keeps changing, like grief”) is forgiven because it lands the thematic hinge. No mixed metaphors; closure image remains crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—”truth is shrapnel,” “orchard remembers falling”—and never clutters high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Strong verbs (“snapped a pear platform loose,” “slipped the hollow casing”) propel momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but breathable: information dual-loads (lantern-light both reveals and isolates). Metaphors are coherent—mountain cold vs salt rope—without mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “softly persistent” appears twice in close proximity; minor scaffold. Rhythm modulates from languid dock sentences to the staccato of naming. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“breathed its beam,” “slid it into”) propel. Closure line is uncluttered, letting the beam do final work.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“white fungi rose like lilies” serves as both image and warning of ephemerality. No mixed metaphors or scaffold. One typo: “compositor’s grid” should lose the apostrophe, but clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative layer is dense yet each image (bleeding thread, crown-ring hiss) advances stakes or sensation. One mixed-metaphor risk—“polite and persistent as lace around a throat”—survives because it fuses temptation with suffocation, on-theme. No paraphrase loops; information density high. Proof: “soot-streaked and steady” condenses ordeal into four words.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm flexes with scene heat: cavernous sentences pool, then snap at finger-snap release. Figurative density is high but patterned—light as vow, spiral as choice—never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensory or causal information. Clean copy; pronouns track across two male leads without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary from short pulses (“I outflew it”) to longer accumulations without template cadence. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful—no mixed metaphors obscure causality. One paraphrase loop: “feral nostalgia… went feral again” costs −0.3; otherwise density is high and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from fog-soft rolls to staccato observations; no template cadence. Figurative layer selective—“pale silhouettes,” “swallowed words”—never clogs high-pressure beats. Information dual-loaded: “clean, frightening blank” reveals symptom and emotion. Zero loops or scaffold; closure image crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the storm: cumulative clauses build hush, then single stressed verbs (“ink flashed, crystal facets forming”) mimic crystalline snap. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative layer is coherent—storm as voice, ink as skin—without mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors upside-down bowl platform; final line tucks quill into sleeve, cadence closing like a lid.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose dense yet propulsive; sentences multitask (“dust drifted like pale pollen through the county sheet music archive” sets tone, place, mood). Figurative language patterned—metaphors of carpentry, rivers, music—without muddle in peak beat. Minor scaffold: “she had learned… she had mocked…” could trim. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors at closure; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluid yet leans on abstract nouns (“contradictions,” “illusions,” “certitude”) that dilute sensory immediacy. Several near-paraphrase pairs (“sent them around and around until they met at a shared center”) could be trimmed. No loops or mixed metaphors in climax, but density of figurative language slows propulsion. Clean grammar and tense.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught (“razor edges” reframed from horizon to ice slit to time slice). Information density high—each sentence advances regulator, sighting, or creed—yet remains read-aloud fluid.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty—description seeds later tactical use (“mycelium mats that acted as living filters”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. One near-purple phrase (“quiet wildfire”) forgiven for thematic resonance. High density without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from long, clause-rich accumulations to the staccato “CERTAINTY IS A COIN WITH TWO HEADS,” mirroring the gamble between pattern and rupture. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each subway message advances knowledge. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“mica pane clouded but unbroken”), never clogging the high-pressure beats. One clause-borderline—“grief felt like clover again, green enough to hold sorrow”—is justified by the motif’s prior anchoring and closure reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “trains rumbled like distant weather and the walls sweated rust” fuses sensory layers without crowding. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for reflection, staccato for the call (“Then do the ending clean”). No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative control holds through the climax. A single filter-verb cluster (“she imagined Lena on the surface”) could trim “she imagined,” but it does not stall momentum or dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, selective, and physically coherent: “reeds hiss like paper” mirrors Mara’s archival vocation, and the metaphor never mutates. Information density is high—walnut broth steeping simultaneously reveals process, color symbolism, and moral stain. Opening and closing lines are precise anchors; no filler paragraphs survive the cut test. Even the experimental long sentence at the end earns its breath because the prior cadence has trained the ear.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose density is high: one sentence often does two jobs—“I gave my last cigarette to the barber, the barber mended a torn coat for a thief, the thief returned a lost child” advances plot, tallies reciprocity, and keeps rhythm. No scaffold loops; metaphors (jokes as fire, timetable of debts) stay coherent. Register holds: no filter-verb stacks or thesaurus churn. Final line—“my silence felt shared”—earns its abstract noun because the prior chain of concrete gifts has embodied the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences to the staccato “ring clicked to stillness,” mirroring the approach to stillpoint. Figurative density is high but each metaphor advances either map-language or grief-texture; no mixed vehicles. One scaffold risk: “quiet blaze” is repeated; however, it is the assigned tonal motif, hence justified. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; information per sentence remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“vine across dry stone” returns as auditory image—no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“looked almost wet”). Strong verbs dominate; no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is supple: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with accordion swell. Figurative density is high yet purposeful—every metaphor (moonlit commas, rope hush) serves silence-mapping. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Minor slip: “joyful sorrow” approaches label-speak, but context reclaims it as paradox the accordion enacts.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative control is tight: “volcano turned outward” lands once, at closure, where it reconfigures the metaphoric ledger. No mixed metaphors; ash, fire, breath, and obsidian form a coherent elemental palette. Rhythm accelerates through enjambed clauses during descent, then snaps to short beats for the drawer reveal, mirroring pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary from long liquid rolls to abrupt taps, mimicking musical phrasing without falling into template cadence. Figurative layering—“auroral sorrow,” “constellation of gestures”—is selective, never stalls momentum, and pays off in final afterimage. Zero paraphrase loops; pronouns stable through entanglement sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is selective (“whispers travel… like water in gutters”) and never clutters high-tempo beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances knowledge, atmosphere, or pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the new quiet order. One clause—“the little constellations catching the storm light”—is slightly ornamental, but it occurs in a lull and does not blunt the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or tactic. Metaphors are coherent—“ribs like a staircase,” “water learning to read a sky”—and physically tied to shutter angles. No filter-verb stacks; actions are verb-driven (“tilted,” “widening,” “wove”). Line-level craft peaks at closure: “darkness there began to shimmer, not banished but persuaded”—compressed, muscular, luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical, sentences double-tasking: “cobalt library seemed to float” sets tone and stakes simultaneously. Metaphors (watery stars, pawn-sapling) stay coherent, no mixed vehicles. No scaffold loops; only two near-adjectives (“quiet,” “humble”) risk repetition but serve thematic pulse. One tiny filter slip—“he heard the unspoken excitement”—would benefit from embodied cue, yet momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; high-information lines (“Coral roots lifted from sand, and the whole mass began to drift seaward, half seen”) advance both image and causality. No filter-verb clusters, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and precise; when it appears (“hair streaming like kelp”) it tightens the maritime lens. Zero scaffolding or synonym loops; every paragraph survives the cut test.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with chore pacing; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“summoning of water from the deep well”) is motivated by Orin’s mock-epic narration, not authorial purple, and drops away at the quiet ending, preserving clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences do multi-duty: “her gaze aesthetically driven toward any line that might make grief look symmetrical” reveals motive, stakes, and metaphor in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each image advances dissolution. Figurative language is sparse under peak pressure—the final three breath-versions are almost bare—heightening the moment. Read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally; paragraph cuts are surgical.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propel without scaffold, and carry double duty (e.g., “cold edge bites her palm like an honest mistake”). One mixed metaphor—“bartered awakenings… turned sour in his mouth”—is minor; no loops or register drift touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet musical—“golden shadows pooled,” “grit of real streets”—without metaphor pile-up. Each sentence advances: mounting the lens, feeding fragments, hearing sigh. No loops or scaffold; “refracted” recurs only when the physics demands. Final clause “learning that connection has texture” is the sole abstract line, but it is earned by sixty prior seconds of tactile sound.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences do double duty: “every pendant she had ever soldered now felt like a small coffin” fuses backstory, metaphor, and emotional charge in one stroke. No scaffold or synonym loops; each metaphor (salt jar, basil-constellation) is used once and repurposed at closure. Rhythm breathes—long grief-laden cadences contract into tool-action fragments. Zero grammar or pronoun ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative layering (“rain stitched the dusk into silver lines”) is sparse enough to avoid purple drift. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. One filter-verb cluster (“I understood the inheritance she left”) is brief and earned. Rhythm modulates with scene tempo—long reflective sentences early, shorter beats at the final fold.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers archival procedure onto emotional stakes. Figurative control holds—mixed metaphors are avoided even at peak beats. Minor scaffold: "turning the pagoda a quarter, then a seventh, then not at all" is a deliberate pattern-break rather than template cadence, so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors per paragraph—each re-used (“milk-reflecting cloud sea,” “stone like a held breath”) to build pattern, not clutter. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Information density is high: one sentence often does three jobs (“She carried her river stone…offering it the only thing she had never uploaded: her unshared childhood dusk”). No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long reflective sentences breathe, then staccato actions (“She wrote two lists…”) propel. No loops or synonym churn; “tail tip” recurs with reweighted meaning, not repetition. Figurative language sparse and accurate—tail as “curled fragment” is precise. Zero scaffolding; each sentence advances character, image, or causality. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths contract under physical strain. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat, no stacking. Information density high: “brown rings on the saucer are the only maps she trusts” does setting, character, and world-rule work. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is dense yet musical: “pressure, and the strip pressed back” doubles noun/verb without redundancy. Figurative control: metaphors of burglary, incubation, and thunder remain coherent under projection-booth physics. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Micro-flaw: “as though forgotten lyrics search for tune inside her skull” leans simile where prior clauses owned the image, a hairline slack in peak beat. Otherwise propulsion is flawless to the whispered end.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long clauses for aurora curtains, staccato fragments for meteor needles. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances map, body, or sky. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—spiral, dust, calendar—paying off in final swarm. One mixed moment: “bruise of green fire” risks cliché, yet the bodily cost immediately grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence advances image, world-rule, or stakes. Rhythm modulates from long rail-thunder lines to clipped seed-planting fragments. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; figurative language is sparse enough to stay precise. Final third remains clean—no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from hammer-blow fragments to winding cadences; no two openings repeat. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful—each metaphor is a gear that later clicks into thematic place. One paraphrase loop (“wind… wind…”) mid-story costs a tenth. Otherwise, every line advances atmosphere, choice, or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often does setting + metaphor + interiority (“the sea keeps breathing a shoreline lullaby, and in that sound she hears the quiet part of herself that always waits”). Metaphors stay coherent—star punch = constellation = wire cutter. Only loop is the triple “keeps —ing” anaphora; it stalls momentum for one beat but never recurs near closure. Opening and closing lines are razor-sharp anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling without scaffold. Figurative language is selective—white palm of snow, bolt like a star—and never clutters high-pressure beats. Information density high: one sentence can anchor setting, reveal policy, and foreshadow surveillance. No loops or mixed metaphors impair clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “heavens above the broken oculus paused, constellations shifting so slowly that an hour became a season” performs world-rule exposition inside a sensory beat. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. One mixed vehicle—“vines hung like loosened braids”—is minor against the sustained control. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors collapsing shelves without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. High density: “quiet solar, a floating cube anchored to pilings, drifting in its leash like a patient animal” does world, tech, and mood in one breath. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“patient animal,” “time slices”—never layered to purple. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffolding. Proofing clean; only nit is an optional comma after “tide gauge” that would aid rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose carries high density: “thunder rolled over the dead docks” fuses weather, sound, and mortality in six words. Metaphors stay coherent—thunder as drummer, stones as circuitry—without mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop detected (“the prayers were over, the leaders jailed or fled”) but it serves as caesura, not clutter. No artifacts touch the final beat; rhythm modulates toward the closing single-sentence paragraph that crystallizes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “amber clouded, unsealed along a seam like a mouth opening” does image + action + stakes in one breath. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors are coherent (mouth, drum, curtain). Final line cadence mirrors kite-flight release, giving sonic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stake, image, or atmosphere. Figurative control is tight: “pearl of stillness” recurs only after earned, never overwrought. Reed-mat windbreaks, waterproof box—objects handled, not catalogued. Final paragraph’s cadence slows to match fog roll without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—image and causality—without scaffold; metaphors (lightning-split Tower = lighthouse) stay coherent. One mixed vehicle: “sea flashed like a cracked mirror” followed by “beam swept as if trying to stitch” creates momentary mirror/needle dissonance, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is selective and patterned (“bright thought that refused to land”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One near-overwrite: “corridor of slow-moving dust” might risk abstraction, but immediate tactile follow-up grounds it. Momentum never stalls; every sentence advances image, stakes, or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from vaulted cadences to clipped revelation; no template churn. Metaphors stay coherent—snow as muffler, copper veins, pond ripple—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often performs atmosphere, world rule, and emotional tilt. Zero loops or scaffold in final third; closure image clean. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized options”) fits archivist’s idiolect, not register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “she watched his shoulders soften as the air cooled” advances both body and atmosphere. No paraphrase loops; metaphors (roses like tranquil blaze) stay consistent with dome optics. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs—“she sheathed it,” “militia backed away”—propel. One mixed moment: “quiet in his palm pulled his thoughts inward the way gravity pulls sand” risks physics stretch, but pattern holds. Line-level control survives closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, high-yield: “silence thickened into a figure” does double duty for atmosphere and plot. One paraphrase loop—“patterns break themselves” repeated twice in 30 words—drops the score a hair. Otherwise clean grammar, precise verbs, zero scaffolding; the final line breathes with propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layer (“white sea,” “orbit of regret”) is selective and purposeful, never crowding causality. Clean mechanics; only minor over-modifying (“practiced wonder”) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “needle buzz sounded like a baby crying under water” fuses tool, sense, and metaphor in one stroke. No synonym loops; “meteor hush” recurs with shifting valence, not repetition for padding. One mixed metaphor risk—“night water” opening overhead—skirts clarity edge but fits the observatory dome reveal. Rhythm accelerates into the final quiet, no scaffolding sentences drag the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with mist: long sentence for echo, fragment for tap. Information density high—one sentence often does setting, metaphor, and motive. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“watered lilacs,” “Conceptual Repricing”) stays within artist POV lexicon. Closure image crisp: “meaning…lived while it was being touched, rearranged, and heard into a hush.”

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors in 800 words, both grounded (steel cradle, bread tray). No synonym loops; “Grasp” and “Keepers” accrue meaning through re-use. Final line (“the past loosen”) is crisp, no scaffold. Copy-clean: tessera/tessera, minaret/minaret consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from short percussion (“She flipped the coin”) to longer braided clauses that mimic echoing; no loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“patient hunger of an encore-seeking stage ghost”—is forgiven because it fuses Silas’s need with the garden’s appetite, and the closure image remains crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “brewed tea, listened closely, and let their fear fill her darkroom” advances action, atmosphere, and stakes in one sweep. Figurative layer is dense yet patterned—ozone, clicking grid, willowglass—no mixed metaphors. One scaffold loop: “she asked him to move, to walk a simple square” could compress to “she had him walk a square,” but the repetition mirrors the protocol’s rigor, so artifact is minor. Closure line is uncluttered, letting final image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences do double duty: “The cave was an enormous sleeping body” fuses metaphor, stakes, and stakes-of-knowing in one breath. No loops or scaffold; each clause advances map, emotion, or world-rule. Figurative layer is spare—only two sustained metaphors (sleeping body, compass needle) and both pay off. Final line’s monosyllabic lift (“began to sing the cave its own name”) gives cadence release without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty (action + metaphor) without purple drift. One paraphrase loop: “prophecy was never one voice, but a braid of voices” restates prior line; minor. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph lands cleanly: “air felt lighter” is simple, earned contrast. Read-aloud rhythm modulates effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is sparse and grounded—“mist slipped across the marks like breath over a mirror”—never stacked. High information density: one sentence often performs atmosphere, tool detail, and emotional cue. No scaffolding or filter-verb clusters in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “rain had been tapping the bridgehouse gutters all evening” compresses duration, place, and mood in one clause. Figurative language is selective—lamps like distant stars, anger percolating—never clustering to purple. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“palimpsest,” “scabbed and scraped”) is justified by Rowan’s professional literacy with documents, so register remains internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative layering (“little kilns,” “pressed-gray lid”) is sparse and purposeful—no metaphor pile-ups in the climax. One paraphrase loop: “flattened again overhead” echoes the earlier smoke line, but it serves as accumulative echo rather than scaffold. High information density; no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops, high density: “wedge those mirror shards between bolts to angle moonlight across the lock faces” does world, body, and tactic in one breath. Figurative control precise—no mixed metaphors, no filler.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or knowledge. Figurative layering (“clouds rolled like a pale surf”) is selective and purposeful, never clogging the beat. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally. A single paraphrase loop—“brittle awakenings” echoed as “each return to dryness felt like waking in a place that had almost dissolved”—is earned by thematic weight, not padding.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences perform double duty: “Their ladders made thin reflections in the water” anchors setting and foreshadows fragile connectivity. No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Figurative control stays precise—cloud-burst sky as “leftover bruises” without mixed metaphor. High information density maintained; zero scaffolding in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Figurative language is sparse, surgical: “braided sound to starlight,” “prayer spoken through concrete.” Information density high—charts, tone generator, subsonic lattice packed into 740 words. Rhythm accelerates into the 2:13 a.m. switch without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty—description seeds next causal trigger (“Each chord marked an interval before the floor slid sideways”)—and rhythm varies from organ-held legato to staccato gasp. Figurative language is selective, never piled in high-pressure beats; mixed metaphors are avoided. One paraphrase loop detected (“the vital key was not metal but consent” restated as “the key was the compass point itself”) but it occurs early and does not touch closure. Pronouns, tense, and spatial tracking remain clean throughout hinge-walls and spiral shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; high information density—each clause adds tool, scent, or contradiction. No synonym loops or scaffold; “ribbon” reappears with accruing meaning rather than repetition fatigue. Metaphors (broken glass, mason’s plumb) stay consistent with narrator’s mechanical mindset. One mixed vehicle: “furrowed hush” is tactile + auditory, but the compression is brief and voice-motivated, not muddling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary from fluid catalogues of salt-stiff pages to staccato revelations (“the lock yielded”), propelling the beat. Figurative language is sparse but precise: the station “exhales,” dread is “spongey,” metaphors never layered to clutter. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each line advances either map-overlay logic or atmospheric pressure. The final clause—“a sky that, at last, had room for Elias Kline’s name”—lands with rhythmic cadence that closes the sonic pattern opened in the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies like bow strokes; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative density is high but each vehicle advances stakes (pixelated amnesty, scaffold flag). One mixed metaphor—“legal and tender” jars slightly but reads as character idiom. Information density strong; every sentence advances image or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling from scanner tech to lion-car silence without scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“dust fell like stage glitter”—never clogging high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop (“loops…returning”) is thematic recurrence, not artifact. Clean grammar and precise verbs sustain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences do double duty: “I recorded everything, in ink and in dream, because chronicles are also vessels” advances both action and theme without flab. One mixed-metaphor risk—“ship stalled in black water” beside desert salt—passes because the chronicler’s own tears later literalize the salt. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph shifts knowledge or emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “branches circling in disciplined fury” packs motion, menace, and military metaphor in four words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence either advances descent or reconfigures the mirror logic. Figurative language peaks at the twin’s “breath halted in crystal,” then thins for the final flat-lake image, creating cadence release. One hairline slip—“a tide of lost things that rose around me like offerings in widening rings”—leans ornamental, but the simile is earned by the prior circle mechanic.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax; figurative density is high but patterned (leaves/rivers/disks) and never clutters the climactic blood-to-seal beat. One near-loop: “future arrived early” appears twice in opening 60 words; otherwise no scaffold or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: every sentence advances atmosphere, stakes, or choice. Figurative language is selective (“skulls like pale apples,” “ash…like dark pollen”) and never clusters into purple. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; temporal sequence is clean. Opening and closing lines book-end the arc with mirrored light-and-pollen imagery, giving the piece a satisfying cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from lean inventory beats to elongated grief coils without losing propulsion. Figurative control: "the valley holding our voices in its stone throat" is the single extended metaphor and it pays off at closure. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. One near-slip: "confidently uncertain nods" is a label pair that could feel workshop-cute, but the next sentence grounds it in physical memory of giving the same nod to sound engineers, so it earns its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with coil charge—long sentences for ascent, clipped fragments for snap warning. Figurative density is high yet coherent: magnetism–grammar–cloud-parchment share the lexical field of inscription. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor advances knowledge or grief. One strained overlap: “knowledge fruit seed” repeats noun stack three times; minor sanding needed.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with the tide, information density stays high, and no loops or scaffold intrude; one mixed metaphor—“moon hung like a clipped coin”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates: clipped inspection verbs yield to liquid consonants in caves. No loops; each sentence adds image or stakes. Figurative language peaks in the crystal reveal yet remains coherent. Strong verbs (“flared,” “spilled,” “loosening”) propel without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ivy threads the ticket windows” performs noun-verb economy. No paraphrase loops or template cadences; metaphors (river living in the station) remain coherent. The only hairline slip—“the air smells of rust and wet leaves, like the river has been living here too”—edges toward overt symbolism, but the simile is grounded in POV perception. Closure line sustains rhythm without figurative muddle, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences do double duty: "mist rose, carrying a faint radiance" advances both atmosphere and beacon. No scaffold loops; each clause adds new causal or sensory data. Figurative layer—"bottled dawn"—is sparse, pattern-taught, and paid off. One hairline slip: "cyclically reversed every thirteen minutes" could trim "cyclically."

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric density sustained without purple overload; each metaphor (velvet observatory breathing heat like dark fruit) advances atmosphere or stakes. No paraphrase loops; information multiplexed (“bitter coffee…grounds run” reveals future and status dynamic). Occasional elevated diction—“provenance indeterminate”—is motivated by bureaucratic genre. Final clause “bright as sap” lands clean, no mixed vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from short crystalline beats to long breathless coils that mimic auroral drapery. Figurative language is selective, never more than one vehicle per high-pressure beat, avoiding purple drift. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge or charge. The final line—“ready to return to her parlor and meet the next quiet face with the same radiant hush”—resolves rhythmically and conceptually, reusing “radiant hush” with new weight.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with ascent: longer sentences climb, shorter ones notch into bark. Figurative language is sparse outside the two allowed poetic nodes (cloud-foam, seasonal pool), preventing purple overload. Zero loops, clean grammar, strong verbs (“wedging,” “scallop,” “replant”) propel without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty—atmosphere, motive, forward motion—without scaffold. Only one paraphrase loop detected (“certainty… certainty” within adjacent clauses) but it occurs pre-escalation and does not touch closure. Strong verbs dominate: “flinched,” “unhook,” “widened.” Figurative language is sparse, precise: cloak like “cool smoke” is the single extended image and it lands. Read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops: each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective—ripples as writing/erasing, iron filings as thought—never crowding a single beat. No mixed metaphors or register drift. The final sentence’s cadence mirrors the sycamore hush, closing the sonic frame opened in line one.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory, metaphoric, causal—“Each return carried dust memories, layers of footfalls and lost prayers.” No paraphrase loops; every clause adds new acoustic information. Figurative vehicles stay coherent within a sonic geology—no mixed metaphors. Only micro-slip: “weathered resolve” edges toward label-speak, but the next line immediately embodies it in breathing steadiness, so closure beat remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences carry double duty: “a needle of blue ice thrust through sun” anchors size, color, danger in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the last rather than repeats. Rhythm accelerates up the spiral, then breathes on the terrace. Only one filter-verb cluster (“he heard…he felt”) but it occurs pre-climax and does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: high information density, zero paraphrase loops, varied sentence openings, and metaphors that obey internal physics (“curtains that waved like tired flags”). Figurative language is selective; no purple stacking in the climax. Copy is clean. The only micro-trace of scaffold is the repeated “I” anaphora in the final paragraph, but it serves as breath-beat under rising water pressure and thus reads intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are few, sharp, and coherent—“bruise lit from within,” “broken chord”—never stacked to clutter. Information density is high: one sentence often performs atmosphere, world-rule, and emotional tilt. A single paraphrase hiccup—“the prophecy was never about certainty, but about becoming aligned enough to act anyway”—could be trimmed, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences perform double labor: “His laughter scattered through the light, crystallized, and became a string of beads I could lay along the map like a safe harbor” simultaneously advances action, deepens metaphor, and reweights stakes. No paraphrase loops; each image introduces new physical logic. Figurative language peaks at the closure beat yet stays coherent—mixed metaphors are avoided. Occasional elevated diction (“atlas page with sea monsters”) is voice-motivated for a death-cartographer.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “nets hang like empty ribs” performs atmosphere and stakes simultaneously. No synonym churn or template cadence; varied sentence openings sustain read-aloud rhythm. One mixed metaphor risk—“cooled flame”—reads as intentional oxymoron matching lukewarm magic. Minor scaffold: “he waits and listens” could compress, but does not stall climax.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences vary from short telemetry—“the lake had dropped again”—to lyric cadence that mirrors water movement, avoiding algorithmic rhythm. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each image advances knowledge or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “rooflines rising from mud as if waking” condenses resurrection and accusation in one stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, rhythm echoing the crucible’s heat-cool cycles. Figurative language is selective: “single dark cloth” for starlings, “door opening on a room she had always owned” for epiphany—no mixed metaphors. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. One minor scaffold—“she needed flame”—could be cut, but it occurs early and doesn’t touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere; only minor scaffold (“the way he paused...”) and one mixed metaphor (“stone dropped into a deep well” beside “frayed sky”) keep it from 9+ perfection, but nothing touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “I opened the jar and placed my palm on the glass, letting my breath slow until I could feel both our pulses” advances plot, theme, and sensation in one line. No loops or scaffold; mixed metaphors are absent. Strong verbs—“sliced,” “shuddered,” “watered”—replace modifiers. One minor paraphrase: “neither of us was an original, we were both rewrites” could trim second clause, but it occurs before the final third, leaving closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; most sentences carry double duty (action + metaphor). One paraphrase loop—“because I am notably receptive, I noticed…”—restates the obvious. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Final image (“storm-born silence… like a vow”) lands cleanly, recharging the opening weather note. Minor loop prevents 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “He grinds them into pulp…mixing in the water that drips from the ceiling” advances action, sets smell, and preps lore requirement. No paraphrase loops; each paragraph adds new sensorial or causal layer. One mixed metaphor—“laughter…flees into places built for echoes, and…can hold it like a jar”—is forgiven because the image is later literalized. Rhythm breathes with escalating paragraph lengths until final terse homecoming.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate; sentence variety carries the dream cadence without drumbeat loops. One mixed metaphor—“boundary stepped like a cautious animal”—is forgiven because it crystallizes the final conceptual reprice. No filter-verb stacks or synonym churn; information density stays high.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty—description advances tool-state while echoing emotional heat. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphor vehicles (banked coals, frozen bloom) stay coherent. One clause—“successive approximation, a measure, a note, a correction, and then the next measure”—risks minor scaffolding but serves as pattern-teaching for the iterative smithing and is paid off. Closure image is uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but never purple; each sentence advances image or action. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay coherent—mast as spear, hush as water—without mixed vehicles. Final paragraph’s rhythm shift (short clauses, then the long sentence of future listening) gives cadence closure. Minor scaffold: “the city had once broadcast…” is pure exposition, but it’s brief and placed early.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet buoyant: “water…arranged itself into interconnected patterns…like the hourglass engraving made liquid” does triple sensory, metaphoric, and causal duty. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances. A single strained simile—“smelled of coffee, hearing footsteps that were not there”—is momentarily ghost-cliché but does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences do double duty: “the calm in the room became unsettling, a quiet so smooth that it scraped” advances atmosphere while foreshadowing the haptic cost of connection. No paraphrase loops; each image adds new angle or sensory layer. Figurative logic stays coherent—thread maps perspective, mirror refuses reflection—without mixed-metaphor clutter. Rhythm accelerates into the eruption, then settles into the hush, ear-tested and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“broken pearl,” “petals.” The single typo (“citys”) is the only artifact. Sentence variety propels the ascent without drumbeat monotony. High information density lets every line serve atmosphere or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences do double duty: “the air held a reeling hush, as if the building itself waited” sets atmosphere and stakes. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends rather than repeats. Rhythm modulates—long breathy clauses in atrium, staccato pulses in stairwell. Opening and closing lines bookend with the aid’s temperature, a subtle echo. Proofing clean; no mixed metaphors or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, precise (“throat of stone,” “tired animals”). High information density: one line often does setting + emotion + stakes. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final line breathes with rhythmic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“dark lake bloom”), and paid off in camera translation. High information density: one sentence often advances setting, emotion, and causality. Only nit: “like small insects” for drive ticks is familiar, but it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences do double duty: “He placed the diamond on Toma’s palm, asking him to stroke its chipped edge” advances action, reveals tenderness, and primes the vibration mechanic. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the acoustic world (flock as score, bone as organ pipe). Register stays within Ilen’s mineral lexicon; no corporate drift. Final scrape and spiral are rendered with surgical clarity—zero figurative muddle at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences do dual work (action + atmosphere) with almost no scaffold. Metaphors are coherent: “gravity learned to smile” is taught by sliding pots and paid off. One mixed image—“laugh that never reached his mouth”—is forgiven because the final line redeems it. No loops, no synonym churn, no register drift; final line lands with crystalline punch.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Every sentence advances image or causality; no paraphrase loops, no filler filters. Figurative layer is dense yet coherent—velvet filing metal, guilty teeth tags—because each vehicle returns to tactile sound. One clause—“a crack that sounded like a chord resolving”—risks minor mixed metaphor but pays off the musical through-line, so artifact stays sub-deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense: “bottle rattled softly, holding cloud and lightning tight.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors stay coherent (storm=rule-bending force). One near-miss: “brittle hush” is repeated; the reprise is purposeful but edges close to mannerism—still, it charges the final cadence rather than clogging it.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “lace of wind bells,” “whispering gleam,” each image does double duty for atmosphere and stakes. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances either the repair or the hush-release. One mixed metaphor risk—“train seemed to inhale”—is saved by the sustained lung motif. Final line varies rhythm, letting the last comma-ring echo the bells.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: each sentence advances image or concept (“the room briefly smelled of river water and coal smoke, the way analog memories arrive without asking”). One paraphrase loop—“stories were not written objects but relations, stitched between readers and paper in curving space”—is forgivable because it crystallizes the reprice. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter; paragraph cuts are crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty—world, metaphor, motion—without scaffold: “light she captured and repainted layered into a doorway.” Figurative control peaks in the final beat where metaphor becomes literal threshold; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“luminous absence” repeated in narration and closure) is purposeful reprise, not artifact. Rhythm accelerates into the single-run final sentence, propelling the resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence advances image or stakes without scaffold. Figurative layering is high but coherent—mixed metaphors are avoided, and vehicles stay within the celestial/locksmith lexicon. One paraphrase loop detected (“steps turned…then a staircase again”) but it serves the disorientation pattern. No artifacts touch the closure beat; final line is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances memory, setting, or mythic rule. Figurative layer is controlled—no mixed metaphors, no synonym churn. One minor scaffold: “she remembered the fever, the boy on the pier, the promise…” lists three abstractions in a row; a concrete sensory fragment would sharpen. Otherwise, cadence breathes with scene tempo, and the final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences do triple duty: “the forgotten library listens like a lung holding breath” fuses metaphor, stakes, and setting in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates into the mirror press, then exhales with the tag’s fall, mirroring the swing’s cadence outside.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary from waterfall-long cadences to clipped seed-placement beats; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is dense but each metaphor services either world-rule (“knot in the weave”) or emotional state (“frostbitten imagination”), avoiding purple drift. Information density is high—one line can anchor setting, tool, and mythic rule. Only minor slip: “the world answered my insatiably creative gesture” is slightly self-conscious meta-commentary, yet it occurs mid-arc, not at closure, so momentum survives.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences do double duty—description advances knot-by-knot action; metaphors (stormlight heart, eyelid slab) remain coherent and physically grounded. Rhythm breathes with beats: caesuras mimic held breath before slab opens. One micro-loop: “interlaced hush” is repeated three times in close succession; however, the phrase is the story’s title-concept, so the echo reads intentional rather than artifact. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences perform double duty: “she traced the last confirmed road until it stopped at a ring symbol” advances plot and stakes. No synonym churn or scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (storm-cloud frescoes, seam in earth). One paraphrase loop—“the whisper was the chapel keeping company”—is justified as thematic compression. Strong read-aloud cadence; paragraph cuts pass.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet clear; mixed metaphors are rare. One minor loop: “way paper turns to lace, the way ink becomes a bruise, and the way silence…” could trim the third anaphora. Otherwise, syntax is varied, verbs strong, and paragraph cuts tight. No artifacts obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, tool-state, or emotional stake. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—no stacked metaphors muddle the lightning beat. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Minor cadence repetition in “he” openings across three adjacent lines mid-story, but rhythm variation elsewhere compensates and closure clarity untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary from fluid cadence to clipped urgency; no template runs or synonym loops. Figurative language is spare and integrated: “ladder built out of light” appears once, at peak beat, and justifies itself. Information density is high—tea tray, goggles, wire key, brake vein—yet never stalls momentum. One mixed metaphor risk (“frozen candle” beside “frozen spine”) is minor and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “the line traced a catenary that trembled with old vortices” advances action, physics, and metaphor in one breath. No scaffold loops; each image is new. One mixed vehicle—“loose tooth in dusty starlight”—is allowed because the cosmic dental metaphor is taught early and reprises at closure. Momentum never stalls; paragraph cuts are surgical.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is dense yet breathable: “ladders and shelves spiraled upward like ribs” does double sensory work. Metaphors are coherent—valleys/rivers on the coin become star charts—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold loop: “fractally precise” is repeated conceptually though wording shifts. Final third avoids figurative overload, keeping closure image crystalline. Minor paraphrase in “heightened stillness of a chapel that had forgotten its prayers” could trim one clause.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty—description advances plot: “the stranded luminance slid along those lines like water choosing a channel” fuses image and causality. Metaphors stay coherent (starlings/numbers/spirals) and avoid purple overload. Minor scaffold: “he noted…he drew…he aligned” triplet could vary syntax, but the loop is isolated and does not touch the closure beat. Opening and closing lines are sonic and propulsive; no typographical or pronoun errors detected.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat at most—and stays coherent (lock sighs, tide of repair). High information density: each sentence advances goal, image, or causality. A single mixed image (“tired patience of driftwood”) is minor enough not to dull closure. Clean grammar and pronoun reference throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid yet disciplined: “valleys stitched with pear trees” packs two senses into five words. Occasional soft fillers—“seemed to attract windblown thorns”—could trim to “attracted windblown thorns,” but such loops are rare and never cluster near closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift; the read-aloud rhythm breathes with the orchard winds.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences perform double labor: “the clock’s hands shivered nearer to midnight without striking” advances plot, deepens stakes, and maintains sonic echo. Figurative layer is disciplined—no mixed metaphors; sea-as-verdict and wave-that-knows-stones extend the maritime lens without crowding. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new pressure or sensory bite. Rhythm accelerates into the final beat then cuts to the keeper’s epilogue, giving clean cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “pressing my palms close enough for frostless air to bruise bark” does triple sensory, metaphorical, and causal duty. Rhythm varies from clipped counts to longer breath-stained clauses, mirroring maze turns. One mixed metaphor—“reluctant applause”—is earned by context and does not obscure clarity. No loops, no filler, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences do double duty: “foam gathered in scalloped rafts” shows image and foreshadows shear domains. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. High-pressure beat (insight on rock) keeps figurative language sparse and precise. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the hike uphill and the hammer-blow finale.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; high information density without scaffold. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent—moonlight as map, silence as countable—never muddling causality. One tiny loop of “I counted” repeats but does not stall the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs: “Rain had just finished worrying the desert” sets weather, tone, and personification in five words. Metaphors stay coherent—coral ribs, brine breath—without mixed-vehicle clutter. Rhythm accelerates during descent, then slows for the kneeling beat, mirroring breath. Minor scaffold: “stored remorse like spice” is repeated conceptually but varied in image; does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense but legible; sentences carry double duty (action + metaphor) without scaffold. One paraphrase loop—“she trained her small night choir to sing…”—restates the multilingual intent already shown. Mixed metaphor spike: “concrete giants” + “silo of words” + “first plank” crowds a single beat. Otherwise rhythm breathes with the hoist-and-bolt tempo, and the final line snaps shut without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Information density high: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and technical work (“copper helix…solder point…collision”). Mixed-metaphor risk—“moon fractured into a dozen pale eyes”—reads as POV hallucination, not incoherence. One paraphrase loop: “she rehearsed…until it settled…she rehearsed…until it stopped” costs −0.2, but it does not appear in the final third, so 9+ global cap is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density—each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is selective (“water dripped upward,” “door of calcite smooth as a book cover”) and never clusters to clog urgency. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Clean mechanics, strong verbs, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary from long breathy accumulations to single-word beats (“She plucks.”), propelling the silent crescendo. Only minor scaffold: two near-adjacent “crack-patterns / crack-patterns” could compress, but figurative control holds; no mixed metaphors dull the final vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm consciously mirrors magnetic sway—long sentences coil, then snap in short predicate bursts. Figurative layering (“iron dust...secret dance”) is purposeful and paid off when dust literally writes. No loops or scaffold; one mixed metaphor (“measuring breath in a sickroom”) barely grazes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “metal clasp locked tight as if the dead owner still guarded a secret” performs metaphor, stakes, and obstacle in one breath. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is selective—reserved for hinge moments—so the final “glitter settling” lands clean without purple drag.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “grave and ripe pears” collapses disgust and sweetness in four syllables. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances scent, motion, or choice. Occasional elevated diction (“olfactorily,” “journalize”) is justified by Jun’s technical mind and stays within her lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “irrigation ribbons unspooled upward” does image + world rule in five words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, motion, or knowledge. Metaphors are coherent—arches as “glass ladders,” silence as “whirling.” One clause drifts toward elevated register (“conceptual repricing” territory) but recovers immediately. Final line lands with cadence match to opening water motif.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty—sensor data, metaphor, forward push; occasional poetic stack (“wind behaved like a liquid”) is earned and pattern-taught; no scaffold loops, no filter-verb clutter; final paragraph lands with clean cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, sound, motion—without scaffold: “the hush loosens as if it had joints” collapses abstract silence into tactile anatomy. Figurative density is high yet patterned; aurora colors return as chords, preventing metaphor sprawl. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. A single near-cliché (“ice over deep water”) is earned by prior ice imagery and does not dull the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from 5 to 35 words, accelerating into the corridor, then settling into quiet cadence at exit. Figurative layer is disciplined: every metaphor (stone throat, iron rain) maps to physical logic of the world. One near-loop: “avalanchingly quiet and heavy” is echoed later as “avalanchingly quiet hush”; because the echo is purposeful reprise that recharges the ending, it reads as pattern, not scaffold. Zero grammar or pronoun errors; strong verbs carry motion.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “wear it in her mouth” shows theft and sensuality. No loops, no scaffold, no filter stacks. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“stars being typeset and erased”) and paid off in the blank broadside. One near-drone in the auditors paragraph kept from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm varies from short pulse-like sentences under aurora glare to longer reflective stretches on Nera, supporting breath control. Figurative language is selective—only two sustained metaphors (aurora as curtain, thaw in stone) and both pay off in the sympathetic vibration logic. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each paragraph advances either motion, memory, or myth. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line (“no one could agree whether he was real”) releases into legend without expositional puff.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors avoided—“water in stone” is sustained, not contradicted. One filter-verb cluster (“I felt… I heard…”) appears in the climax but is justified by the narrator’s stunned reception. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, propelling and resolving the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from long filamentary builds to single-word clauses under pressure; no template cadence. Figurative layering is high but patterned—silence as thread, dusk, tide—each recurrence reweights stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; information density carries dual duty (image + causality).

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is compressed and rhythmic, almost every sentence advancing stakes or texture: “he shaped it into azure defiance, a calm blue flame.” One paraphrase loop (“memory loosen, slipping into confusion…like a fruit you taste only after it is gone”)轻度重复 but does not stall momentum or touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often maps temperature, scent, and emotional charge. Figurative language is selective—green shard as “dangerous sail”—and never clutters the climactic seam-cut. One paraphrase loop (“weight… heavier than any cargo” echoed two sentences later) but it lands outside the closure beat. Final line is crisp, image-driven, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—lighthouse as throat, lens as eye—without mixed metaphors. High information density: “three flat stones meant safe water, two meant trouble, and a single tall cairn meant come” teaches rule and stakes in one breath. Rhythm breathes with the scene—long sentences for fog, staccato for filament repair—propelling to the final silver sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but breathable; figurative layering serves the concept, never obscuring causality. One scaffold loop: “laughing…laughter” echoes three times in mid-section without new pressure. Otherwise, sentences carry triple duty—image, motion, theme. Read-aloud rhythm surges with storm, then settles into starlit hush at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative layering recedes when stakes peak, preventing purple overload. One paraphrase loop (“stories magnetize… stories stick”) and a filter-verb cluster (“I began to understand”) mildly dull momentum. Otherwise rhythm breathes, and every paragraph advances knowledge or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences do double duty—sweeping grief-flakes while foreshadowing the roof route. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “windows into sheets of moving ink” is earned. One paraphrase loop (“my duty was to keep the stones aligned…”) and a minor filter-verb cluster (“I felt the weight…”) keep it from 9+. Otherwise propulsive, clean, and read-aloud ready.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or memory economy. Metaphors stay coherent—starlight split by mica becomes thread that “warmed her fingers like breath held too long,” fusing tactile and temporal. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“pulled,” “fought,” “spill”). Rhythm modulates from incantatory song to urgent clause burst at the climax, mirroring night’s tightening collar. Final line lands on concrete noun-verb pair—“long awaited sky”—without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences do double duty: “he could remain in the museum as a harmless clerk while his true self crossed into the Society’s stacks” advances both disguise and psychological split. Metaphors are spare and coherent—honeyed lamplight, paper seam—never stacked. One paraphrase loop (“mistake… error… blunder” in adjacent clauses) mildly dulls momentum, but it does not touch the closure beat. Opening and final lines are crisp, no scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean and rhythmic; no synonym loops or template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“lantern light trembling among fig trees” sets tone without density overload. Strong verbs (tucked, bricked, scraped) replace modifiers. Opening and final lines anchor voice and reweight stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “quartz hush,” “slow ink,” “tremble in their light” each do double sensory-conceptual work. No paraphrase loops; every sentence either advances the slide’s warming or Ilian’s interior transfer. Metaphors stay coherent within the glass-light-frost matrix. A single adjective stack—“gentle, unfinished sentences”—is justified by the sister memory’s fragility, keeping line-level craft firmly in the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. High density: “lantern glass and wet coin” does two jobs of image and economy. One mixed metaphor check—“lanterns rocked like tired fireflies” slightly jars with maritime palette but does not touch closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; prop tracking (fob, wax, chain) stays exact.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    Figurative density is high but patterned (taste, metal, weather) and tied to POV; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—slow ribbons, then hard stop of ring settling. One paraphrase loop (“converge” twice in four lines) and a buried lead mid-paragraph are minor scaffolds. No artifacts touch the final image; clarity and propulsion remain strong, though not pristine enough for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “lantern light spills into a subterranean crystal cave where the walls glitter like frozen music” carries three sensory channels in one sweep. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or tactic. Metaphor stack is controlled—only two figuratives per high-pressure beat—and vehicles stay physically coherent. Minor purple tint in “auroral sorrow” is forgiven because the phrase is later literalized as colored light on stone.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “conversations evaporated without a last line” does double world-and-character work. No mixed metaphors; the spiraled sap arrow, zinc click, and fern frond create a consistent tactile lexicon. One scaffold loop—“she reread the map scraps… reread the fragments”—is forgiven because the repetition mirrors her obsessive search. No artifacts touch the final beat, keeping 9-band eligibility intact.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythmic variety mirrors carillon cadences; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layering is dense but each metaphor extends the spectrum motif; no mixed vehicles. Information density is high—each sentence advances wind-motion-light causality. One minor scaffold: “truth had a spectrum” is abstract, but immediately grounded by prismatic flash. Closure line breathes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, disciplined, and coherent—flame “small as a candle,” ribs “flex like bark.” No mixed metaphors or register drift. High information density without overwriting; the read-aloud rhythm modulates with the fire’s crawl.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with beats; no template cadence. Information often doubled (synonym pairs like “nowhere and everywhere”) but compressed enough to avoid drag. Metaphors stay physical and consistent. One paraphrase loop (“listening heals”) is institutional tagline, not peak-beat clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “saltwater pressed against cracked glass like a slow drum” anchors setting, stakes, and Lyra’s sonic bias. No scaffold loops; each clause advances. Figurative language is patterned—spider, dice, web—and never muddies causality. One mixed vehicle—“alarms sang only to themselves”—is allowed because it is closure-adjacent and thematically apt.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are coherent—gravity pockets, glass cities, lantern moths—and never stacked in high-pressure beats. Rhythm modulates from hush to blade-bright to final cadenced release. Proof-clean; no scaffolding or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lyrical yet information-dense: one sentence often does two jobs (“She pressed the crane’s origami wing to the water, and it drank the remaining code”). Metaphors are mostly coherent; only “tranquil blaze” risks oxymoron but is justified by gauze-hearth image. No loops or scaffold detected; rhythm modulates without algorithmic repetition. A single filter-verb cluster (“seemed to lean closer to hear nothing”) is minor enough to leave 9+ bands open.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet limpid: “meteors stitched white seams across the dark” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or tactic. Figurative language peaks at the wax impression then recedes, preventing clutter. Minor over-modification in “gentle insistence” is the only hairline slip, and it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings. Occasional stacked modifiers (“tragically radiant,” “ghostly resolve”) flirt with purple but pattern is taught early and pays off in final image. No paraphrase loops; information density high. One mixed metaphor stretch—“light quarantined from the day”—but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “pearl twilight lay over the fjord” opens with rhythmic anapest, then switches to hard stresses during key insertion. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative control holds—mixed metaphors avoided even when rose, iron, and ink converge. One clause—“the scent of crushed petals rose faintly as if the cave remembered summer”—risks purple but earns its place by halting Senn’s cadence, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances sonic mythology or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—vehicles stay acoustic (reed, thread, echo) and never mixed with unrelated domains. High information density: “the chamber now returned her footsteps too loudly” simultaneously reveals world rule, poetic justice, and tactical outcome in eleven words.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry triple duty—atmosphere, motive, world-rule—without scaffold: “glass does not slump into itself in seawater unless…” marries technical observation to moral indictment. Rhythm varies from long accumulative clauses to short pulses under pressure. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse, precise. A single filter-verb cluster (“she saw… she saw…”) during the lens vision is minor enough to leave high-band intact.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layers (“moon in shreds”) stay coherent and never stack during the high-pressure smuggler beat. One paraphrase loop—“hidden effort…quiet courage behind a watch”—could trim, but it doesn’t touch closure. Density remains high: each sentence braids sensory, symbolic, and causal work.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “rows of apple trees, leaves glossy and unburned” does triple duty—image, impossibility, temptation. No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors; the single participial opener “Standing in a basin” is sequential, not simultaneous, so clarity holds. One micro-drag: “I promised, for my own motivation as much as for her grief” is self-explanatory throat-clearing—cutting it would push this toward 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “lightning sketch equations across the glass” shows weather, metaphor, and Eli’s delusion in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each clause advances. One mixed metaphor risk—“blue bruise” beside “sanctified”—reads intentional, so waived. Filter verbs absent under peak pressure; strong verbs drive propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—sound, emotion, and metaphor in one coil: “the tide hiss jar went first… the spring loosened, as though the box remembered.” No loops or scaffold; occasional alliteration (“salt-stung,” “lonesome splendor”) stays purposeful. One mixed risk: “positively wistful smile” edges on cliché, but the adverb is later redeemed when the smile never reaches his eyes—self-contradiction shown.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “drift-ice marina creaked like an old ribcage” fuses metaphor and sensory specificity without purple drift. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. One hairline slip—“confession seemed to drain into the sound like blood into bandage”—leans simile-heavy amid climax, keeping it below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes: long moonlit sentences contract to clipped “then, by her signal.” No scaffold loops; each sentence advances tactic or atmosphere. Figurative layer is spare—only “wolf behind a half-opened door” and “angry twitch”—each paid off in action. One mixed metaphor risk—“iron sky meets white water”—reads as horizon line, not muddle, so minimal deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry triple duty—atmosphere, fact, motive—without metaphor pile-ups. Concrete nouns (“portable shear,” “chalk arrows”) replace modifiers. Zero paraphrase loops; each detail advances. The final paragraph’s rhythm slows to match the extinguished flame, then snaps shut on “would not reverberate,” giving cadence closure. Clean copy: no tense slips, pronoun drift, or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose breathes with variable rhythm; storm-light “breaks” twice, each time recharging meaning rather than repeating. Figurative control keeps gears/heart metaphors coherent; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop—“second opinion” appears three times in closing paragraph—barely dulls momentum. High information density: one sentence often performs atmosphere, motive, and causal push (“the clockwork heart lay there… as though it knew it did not deserve to run”).

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; rhythm accelerates into flight, then exhales on landing. Figurative density is high but patterned—coins, teeth, bells—taught early and paid off. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“pebble into time and hearing it never land”) is earned by emotional crest, not muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: one sentence often performs scene, voice, and world work (“families still tag the dead…three in the morning”). No paraphrase loops; metaphors (threads like roads) stay coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) fits corporate narrator lexicon and does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “she stitched light to shadow the way she had been trained” does triple duty (action, metaphor, backstory). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language spikes in the climax yet stays coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing”) is acceptable within the story’s mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, selective, never muddles causality. Information density high: “wind moved constantly there, not hostile, just tireless” does three jobs in ten words. Zero paraphrase loops; only micro-repeat is “fold in patience” twice, justified as motif.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: no paraphrase loops, no filler filters. Figurative layer is dense but each image (crushed skins, held breath of pavilion) advances atmosphere or stakes. One mixed metaphor—“cork that belongs to one bottle yet is pressed into another until both bleed”—skirts physical impossibility yet reads as character speech, not artifact. Final paragraph lands with cadence shift that mirrors dawn exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is taut, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences multitask, advancing atmosphere while guiding action. Metaphors (“parapet... like ribs under skin”) cohere and do not pile up within high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop—“clearing could be called... a clearing of quiet”—is a hairline slack. Otherwise no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks, and the final paragraph lands with crystalline brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentences carry double duty (“widow’s profile joining a coworker’s raised fist” advances both photo placement and social repair). One scaffold loop—“arcs began to answer curves” restates prior beat without new pressure—minor, outside closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift; high density maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “night like ink,” “paper skins shedding silently” do double duty; one paraphrase loop (“suspended hush” repeated without new pressure) and a single mixed metaphor (“weathered innocence”) keep it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, emotion, world rule—without overcrowding: “the magnetic hush thick as fog” conflates medium, weather, and stakes. No paraphrase loops; each driftwood arrow adds new orientation or memory slip. Metaphors stay coherent within salt-electronics domain; no mixed vehicles. Minor register elevation (“tidal longing”) is earned by prior concrete tide imagery. Closure line is uncluttered, letting the transitive verb “copy” carry the conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “the domes breathed slow vapor as if the mountain itself were thinking” sets tone and stakes simultaneously. No scaffold loops; each clause advances. Metaphors stay coherent—clock hand “like a trapped comet,” Moon “bright as a scar”—and culminate in closure image. Only micro-slip: “luminous ache of the shaking night” edges purple but reads as POV hyper-awareness under stress; doesn’t dull clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is textured yet spare: “jagged as a shard of night,” “breath runs out,” each metaphor serves dual duty (image + emotional state). No paraphrase loops; every sentence advances image, action, or stakes. Rhythm modulates—long lullaby clauses contract to “the needle drops it wobbles yet holds” to mimic cardiac falter. One mixed metaphor risk—“aroma…becomes the scent of hope”—but the POV’s synesthetic bias justifies it and the closure image redeems the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Figurative control is disciplined—“noon fell like water… like stone” sets the physics break early, never repeated. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for ascent, staccato clicks for the automaton, quiet final clause as reservoir sighs. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; information density stays high without purple compression.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “the wrong kind of familiar, like seeing his own handwriting in a threat” does double duty—metaphor and stakes in one stroke. No loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. The final clause “determined to chart whatever came next” could be trimmed to avoid a touch of editorial summary, but it does not dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; sentences carry dual duty (“he weighed that guilt the way he weighed his brass star charts”). No loops or scaffold, strong verbs (“loosened,” “rounded,” “charged”). Figurative layer is restrained; only “night itself had learned to smile” edges sweet but survives at closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with polishing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long clauses for moss hush, staccato drip sentences for encryption urgency. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught early (“servers lay like tombstones”), paid off in resin seal. One loop risk: “quiet that tasted of sap” echoed as “honeyed hush” could read as synonym churn, but cadence shift differentiates. No scaffolding; every paragraph advances knowledge or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “letters seeped from its grooves into the margins” does triple duty—image, stakes, plot trigger. Figurative language is patterned (tidal, baking, editorial) and pays off in the reversed river and yeast-scented hope. No synonym loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image or choice. One mixed metaphor—“ground…rustled with unfinished choices”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm is varied and read-aloud smooth; sentences advance both image and causality. One scaffold pair: “the contraption looked like a child had tried to copy a harp from a dream, but Marn knew dreams were where the truest tools begin” restates the same insight; trimming the second clause would tighten. Metaphors stay coherent within the orchard’s physics. No filter-verb clusters or loops touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and tactical information (“flash-paper flare without smoke” fixes image and stakes in one stroke). Metaphors are coherent—constellation of refuse, starlight as seed—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: two adjacent sentences begin “She…” in the sealing beat, but rhythm recovers. No loops or synonym churn; closing line (“aurora…moved a fraction”) lands with precise cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “frost came late and left early” compresses season into causality; lanternlight/echo pitch correlations do double duty as sensory and plot data. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and machined to purpose. A single filter-verb cluster (“seemed to drift”) is justified by the POV’s uncertainty about echo agency. Closure line is unmarred, earning high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary from tidal anapests to clipped rotations; no loops or scaffold, high density—each image advances atmosphere or stakes; mixed metaphors are avoided, and the final “whalebone reverie” line breathes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors steam cycles: clipped during carve, expansive during cloud. Figurative language is sparse and carpentry-specific; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop—“crystals cloud... crystals clear”—is purposeful echo, not scaffold. Information density high; every sentence advances craft, memory, or atmosphere—minor hairline repetition in “rain-beaded skylight loft” opener keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry dual duty: “water looping…click like gears” shows motion and sounds simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language sparse outside taught pattern, avoiding purple drift. Strong verbs (“pinning,” “forfeiture”) replace modifiers. Closure image (“tend the small repairs”) crisp and uncluttered. Minor alliteration but not intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “first trickle sounded like a small animal returning to a burrow” does double sensory duty without overwriting. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances flow, light, or insight. Filter verbs are scarce and purposeful (“she realized” is earned after physical discovery). One micro-scaffold: “she rerouted…she redirected” in adjacent clauses, but the repetition enacts the iterative tuning she performs, so it reads intentional rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during the bear approach, then lengthens for the shared stillness, mirroring respiratory fear. Metaphors stay mechanical—stone murmurs, clocks refuse to ring—keeping the POV’s diction coherent. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Only hairline slip: “petrichor nostalgia” edges toward label, but is immediately embodied by throat-tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—description braided to motive—yet occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”-type phrasing in narration) slightly overshoots POV lexicon. No loops or mixed metaphors; prop and body positions track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “snow sifted…softening every rope creak into an oceanic hush” does three jobs in one breath. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent. One near-purple phrase—“quiet argument between order and drift”—is earned by prior concrete knot-work, so permitted.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long loom-sentence followed by clipped “I tied the carpet thread.” Metaphors stay coherent—thread as bridge, absence as map—with no mixed vehicles. One scaffold near opening (“salt and coal smoke”) is instantly grounded by palace hill. No loops or synonym churn in peak beat. High density: one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and causality.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; stacked metaphors (“chandelier palace,” “sugar burnt on a blade”) stay purposeful and paid off. Minor scaffold: “he hypothesized aloud, because sound steadied him” repeats twice. No loops obscure causality or dull the final pigment bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty—action, metaphor, emotional calculus—without scaffold. Figurative control consistent: “clouds migration,” “kelp-drift peace,” “black sand shining as if it could absorb every story.” No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Minor filter verb in “I watched the girl stare” but immediately compensated by embodied detail. Closure image crisp, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “lantern light seemed to bend toward her yet she refused every easy story” advances both world and character. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (constellation map = valve code). One clause—“the whole city listened”—is mild hyperbole, but within lyrical license. Closure image is uncluttered and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “starvines coiled as their ancestors had” packs history and metaphor in five words. Mixed metaphors are controlled—gear-as-map, moth-as-engine, light-as-discipline—each revisited without contradiction. One paraphrase loop: “across the quiet sigh of falling petals” appears twice; second use reprises time marker and earns thematic echo, so penalty minimal. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“strained,” “carving,” “loosen”) propel motion.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable—“orange wings drifted over the glass like embers” does triple sensory work; occasional soft repeats (“thundering calm”) are pattern-taught and payoff in the final line, so artifacts never dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is spare—“cooled forge,” “surf gnawing”—each image does double duty for setting and emotional state. No scaffolding; every paragraph advances knowledge, intention, or emotional charge. Lead weight wrapped in cloth and dated on the rake handle is a concrete, propulsive detail that carries into closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no scaffold or synonym loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“velveteen gloom,” “cobalt silo”) risks purple but remains anchored to POV’s heightened night perception. One mixed metaphor drift: “night feels less like a shroud and more like velvet” edges close to tactile cliché, yet the reweighting justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, metaphor, and causal push (“numbers that felt like bones warmed in her pocket”). Figurative layer is sparse, taught early (“dull mirror beneath the obsidian spire”), and paid off when the lake cracks open. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge, stakes, or texture. A single near-miss—“conditional sentences” repeated in adjacent clauses—drops the tenth of a point.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; metaphors (dust, ember, thistle) form coherent field without overcrowding beats. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentences vary in length, supporting musical cadence. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing”) momentarily lifts register above Mara’s voice but occurs outside peak beats. Clean grammar, precise punctuation, strong verbs anchor the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“night sky being made”) and paid off in the ash-scatter finale. No mixed metaphors or register drift; high information density without purple compression. Clean copy, varied paragraph rhythm, strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “green with age but sharp as a fresh decision” compresses time and agency into one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either stratigraphy or bodily strain. Rhythm accelerates during the dig—long sentence for the auger’s descent, staccato fragment when metal clicks. One near-miss: “principles needed anchors” flirts with aphorism, but the next sentence buries the cliché under pipe fittings and sewer stench.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; high information density—“the vanishing arts were quieter casualties, erased not by flames but by memos”—carries two jobs (image + stakes) without padding. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each metaphor (velvet hush, station echo, lace shadow) is deployed once and repurposed at closure. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. One near-miss: “expectantly resigned” risks oxymoron cliché, but the contradiction is immediately embodied in action, so clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density high—one sentence often does three jobs (taste, memory, world-rule). Figurative language is sparse and precise: “moons lined up like coins on black velvet” serves as clock and stakes. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“branches tried to tangle… like a hand”) but it resolves into the canopy image without muddling closure. No artifacts in final third; eligible for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or causality. Metaphors stay pollinator-ecstatic yet precise—“nectar dusk,” “tiny projector bees spiraled out.” No filter-verb stacks, no register drift. Opening and closing lines book-end with pollinator light. A single adverb (“involuntarily truthful”) is accepted as diagnostic shorthand; otherwise diction is concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or rule. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay coherent—“hushed blaze,” “compact quiet”—and culminate in the final iris-note. One microscopic scaffold: “the conversations made a gentle heat you could feel through plaster” is slightly explanatory, but it caps rather than stalls the beat, so penalty stays sub-deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, causality, or pressure. Metaphors are spare and coherent: “algae fronds holding still like curtains” serves spatial clarity before it beautifies. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“unspooled,” “cradled,” “spiraled”). Opening and closing lines frame the arc with sonic echo—“descending” vs. “rose toward the surface”—creating cadence closure without scaffolding. Artifacts do not appear; prose is publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; clauses stack like steps, then break into monosyllables when the wheel stalls. No filter-verb clusters or synonym loops. Metaphors are sparse and clean—“flaw that sounded like truth”—and never obscure causality. One paraphrase loop (“each step was the same height, each turn the same angle”) is purposeful patterning, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “letters… drifted up like seeds” does double sensory work. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors stay coherent within smog/light/seed lexicon. One near-purple line (“methodically hopeful that one clean beam could still reach”) is justified by voice and not repeated.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “rosewater from the crust rose with the cold mist” does triple sensory duty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, tactic, or temperature. Metaphors stay physically coherent (ice door, varnish crust). Minor elevated diction (“provenance,” “scrims”) fits museum-guide POV and is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density, zero loops, varied sentence lengths. Figurative language is controlled; only one near-muddle (“teeth of stone” beside “weed-dark”) but image remains legible. No artifacts near closure; final beam sentence lands clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: "fungus breathed a cold perfume" does triple sensory duty. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, stakes, or tactic. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors per beat at most—and coherent: the flash-bulb maggot, the swan hook, the wet-paint fear. One hairline slip—"repulsive allure" is repeated within sixty words—barely grazes closure. Otherwise, syntax varies, subjects stay strong, and the final line releases with percussive finality.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from long breathless clauses during the squall to staccato taps of barrel-bell beats. Information density is high: one sentence often layers sensorial data, tactical consequence, and metaphoric echo. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each percussive noun (knock, ring, thud) is distinct. A single mixed metaphor—“conductor without an orchestra”—is allowed because it is taught early and paid off when the crew becomes his ensemble.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences do double duty: “dust leaps from a narrow seam” shows both acoustic success and forward motion. Metaphors stay coherent—gate as mouth, rust as reef, compass as confessor—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold loop appears (“spiral to mean shelter” echoed three lines later) but it is brief and early enough to avoid dulling the climax. Rhythm modulates from sun-bleached cadence to the final staccato taps, propelling the ending without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences do double duty: “ivy had overgrown the brick walls so completely that the nameboards looked like graves with green hair” fuses metaphor, status, and stakes. No paraphrase loops; each clause advances knowledge or pressure. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to staccato bargain beats. One near-mixed metaphor—“weeds rose through the tiles like slow smoke”—but physical logic holds (weeds ≠ smoke) and the image is saved by POV-coloration, so deduction stays minor.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or obstacle. Figurative layer is spare—only “curtains of weed,” “pale ladders”—and paid off by action. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases breath. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no algorithmic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense: “pale tunnel through silted water” does three jobs at once. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors are coherent (city “held breath,” page “exhaled”) and avoid purple escalation. Minor filter verbs (“I knew”) are voice-motivated and sparse enough to retain immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors are avoided—light bites, shadows crawl, paper accepts creases, all consistent. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s rhythmic repetition of “lanterns shaped like cranes” is earned callback, not template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. High information density: one sentence often performs sensory, emotional, and causal work. Metaphors (“smoke that still weighs your palm”) stay coherent and grounded. Minor loop risk in “perturbation” repetitions but each use carries new causal payload; no mixed vehicles. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns; paragraph cuts tight—none removable without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “the chain sounded like punctuation in the quiet” performs three jobs—auditory, metaphorical, character beat—in nine words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Figurative language clusters only in low-tempo descriptive stretches; under peak beat (fitting chips, cranking tuner) diction turns spare and tactile. Minor alliteration (“brass…brilliant”) is pattern-taught early and feels intentional. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns, strong paragraph cuts.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long tidal sentences build, then clipped clauses at the reveal. Figurative language is selective—no metaphor stacking—and vehicles stay coherent (sea, mesh, ticking). One paraphrase loop around “weight of withheld truth” is the only minor scaffold. Information density is high; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere without padding.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses (mist stitching parapet) to staccato beats (boots scrape, chains chimed). Figurative language is selective: “mist stitched” teaches pattern early and pays off in final hush; no mixed metaphors. Information density high—one sentence often layers weather, body, and political stakes. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong density: most sentences layer motion, sensory cue, and metaphor without clog. Mixed metaphor cluster (“wet paper tears,” “salt in a cut,” “backlash”) in the same early paragraph mildly dilutes precision. No loops or scaffold survive; final third stays clean, keeping 8-band within reach.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    High-density lines carry triple duty—action, metaphor, emotional tilt—without clogging. Rhythm breathes at beats: short pulses during hatch descent, longer coils for lake reveal. Zero paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; only a single filter-verb cluster (“felt heavy”) but it coincides with legitimate tactile moment.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from cavernous clauses to the final short circling line; mixed metaphors are avoided. Occasional elevated phrasing (“geometry,” “conceptual repricing”) momentarily lifts register above the POV’s concrete sensorium, a hairline slip that keeps it below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty (image, motion, metaphor) without scaffold; only a single mixed metaphor (“confession trapped here in weather”) momentarily clouds physics, but the final palm-trace line lands clean, ensuring no closure drag.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, metaphor, and causal nudge: “thread pulled from vacuum suit seals” tells material, stakes, and scarcity in five words. Rhythm ascends with Mara’s body, then releases in a breath-long final sentence that mirrors the hatch opening. Two adjacent “she”-openings create minor scaffold; not enough to dull closure. No mixed metaphors; figurative logic stays coherent (salt track → mercury → silver thread).

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates from incantatory opening to staccato ash-sift without template cadence. Figurative layering is dense yet precise: "lava smoked... waves hissed on coal-dark grit" compresses two senses into one verb each. One paraphrase loop—"transformation has a grain, a roughness you can feel when you stop resisting it" restates the lava-sand image already shown. Otherwise zero scaffold, high density, and the final applause-line propels closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling without scaffold. Figurative language is selective: “locks that usually snapped at midnight eased open by a hair” does two jobs—sound and stakes—in one stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose density is high—each sentence advances image or causality; no scaffold or synonym loops. Metaphors (“storm shaped like a mouth”) stay coherent and necessary.

Rhythm accelerates across the three pours, propelling the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates from long tidal sentences to the clipped “I pruned one brittle twig,” mirroring diffusion of anger.

Minor deduction for slight over-compression in tunneling sequence, where physical effort borders on implausible—but this serves thematic urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “rain sounded like someone folding velvet” establishes tone and tactility in one stroke. Figurative language is coherent (light as envelope, thunder as voice) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in mid-story (“vault for words,” “emotions having coordinates”)—still legible but borders on density without variation. Final paragraph’s cadence (“thunder that has learned to whisper”) perfectly resolves opening motif with earned quietude.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“The astrolabe was heavy with memory; if Sel pressed an ear to it, the metal murmured names of stars that had died before any written year”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “green fire against the winter dark” and “silver dust that swarmed upward” slightly strain metaphor coherence, but never obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s cadence (“walked through them as if through dreams finally given daylight”) recharges the opening’s dreamer motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)

Figurative language is pattern-taught (mechanical flora) and payoff-consistent (wind’s timbre shift at end). No loops or scaffold—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in translocation description (“mailed” metaphor risks obscurity), but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “leash end frayed like seafoam” conveys state, metaphor, and emotional residue in six words. Sentence variety supports rhythm—long undulating lines for sea descriptions, staccato phrases for panic. One minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in the middle third (“heather and cloud braid together,” “stones seem listening”) risks purple prose, though it serves the accumulative lens. No loops, no scaffolding, no clarity breaks—even complex images remain legible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)

    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gears murmur behind the walls,” “dust glowed… with a luminescent ache.” Every sentence multitasks—establishing mood, advancing plot, revealing character. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent (light as thread, library as body). Final line’s “stitched radiance that asked, without needing answers” crystallizes theme without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful: “iron frame jointed like a cradle,” “pulse of remembered prayer rise into his throat.” Figurative language is coherent and earned—no mixed metaphors.

Sentence variety supports emotional cadence—fragments for tension (“No money is hidden there”), flowing clauses for revelation. Minor overwriting in “windblown sand” metaphor slightly strains physical logic (sand doesn’t braid), but doesn’t obscure closure. One paraphrase loop: “follow those arrows with Lio at my side… follow the seam” could tighten, though not severely.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “alarms slept under silt” conveys setting, time, and threat).

Figurative language is coherent—steam as script, wax as mortar—and never overwhelms causality. Sentence variety supports rhythm: short clauses during tension (“I followed… clicks of old hinges”), flowing cadences in reflection. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “hairline cracks arranged themselves into lines”—“arranged” verges on anthropomorphism—but closure remains unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “scorched, as if it had kissed the lightning collection tower” merges image and causality; “sap softened as if shamed” personifies without purple excess. No loops or scaffold—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully, from the languid “nectar dusk” opening to the staccato truth-revelation. One minor slip: “brittle code” slightly abstracts, but it’s anchored by context. Final line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “streetlights daydream,” “hush slid into her palm,” “floorboards softened underfoot” all advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence propels. Figurative language is coherent—hush as “kindling for a fire that made no smoke”—and never muddles causality.

Final line (“Tell them the whole seam”) echoes the threading action, rewarding attention with syntactic and thematic resonance. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, with paragraph cuts heightening discovery beats.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or concept. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (dice chip as “truth,” expectation as motion). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally with paragraph length and sentence structure. Final lines (“each one was mine, and that was the only exit the proofs allowed”) resolve with image and recharged motif. Minor density in mid-section (“proof by contradiction” exposition) slightly slows propulsion but remains voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold—every sentence propels. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“moon-tipped brush,” “drowned streetlamps”) and paid off (“crescent shells” on glass).

Final line (“wrote one last word… rouse”) resolves by recharging the moon motif with actionable hope—no purple prose, no muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “monumental curtain of water,” “sweet dread, like rose syrup turned sour,” “crusts dark as varnish.” Figurative language is coherent—rosewater, honey, mold interweave without muddle. Minor redundancy in “rescued what she could… rescue what she could” slightly dulls propulsion, but closure image (“arts thawed back into breath”) is pristine. No scaffold loops or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)

Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors; “maggot” flash bulb aligns with decay motif. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary rhythmically. One minor density risk: “repulsive allure” appears twice, but the repetition serves thematic echo, not redundancy. Final paragraph’s cadence (“walked out… went dark for good”) delivers closure with quiet authority.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “sea still held the day in its throat,” “sky began to bruise”—figurative language is consistent, physical, and never muddled.

Rhythm varies naturally, with paragraph cuts serving emotional beats. Minor figurative density in the opening (“weeds rose through the tiles like slow smoke”) risks slight overwriting but pays off in closure’s “cold wind threaded through the ivy.” No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every line advances pressure or character.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high information density: “moonlight filters down in pale ladders, igniting a hushed blaze across silted tiles” merges image, tone, and setting.

Final line (“her hidden words will bind the pavilion back to memory”) recharges motifs without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ink bled dark, and under the lighthouse emblem, letters surfaced in the fibers as if the page exhaled” does triple duty (action, image, theme). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (light/darkness, breath/silence, drowning/truth). Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in mid-story, but no artifacts dull closure. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence (e.g., short paragraph before “I sat on a toppled globe”).

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful metaphor (“kettles sing,” “leaves drift like small boats”) but avoids overwriting—figurative language serves character and stakes.

No loops or scaffold—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor deduction for one slightly overloaded clause (“intangibly tangible, like holding smoke that still weighs your palm”), but clarity remains intact even in peak beats. Final line crystallizes tone, concept, and closure without flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “stones began to drink the last light and give it back as a brilliant dimness” establishes tone economically. Figurative language is coherent—light as liquid, sound as comet—and avoids overwriting. Minor flaw: “pulled the rotors free of their clips, the motion deliberate” slightly stalls momentum with explanatory clause, but this is offset by strong sentence variation and paragraph cuts that mirror discovery rhythm.
