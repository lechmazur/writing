  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is solid: varied syntax, concrete imagery, no major loops. Opening and closing beats carry thematic charge. However, a few phrases feel overwritten for their moment: "luminous glass artist, known throughout the territory" front-loads exposition, and "drifting resonance of regret" stacks metaphor during a gunpoint scene. The phrase "scorched testament" appears twice in similar constructions, creating minor redundancy. The summary transition ("The stars had faded to grey when she walked back…") compresses the climax into tell, reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high: most lines advance character state, world detail, or thematic image. The opening sentence establishes voice, setting, and damage in one move. Minor loops appear: "the ocean had taken something permanent" / "the ocean had silenced her" restate without added pressure. "Silently expressive" and "unshaken marvels" feel like prompt-element insertions with elevated diction that doesn't quite match the surrounding register. Stock phrases cluster: "bloomed across her skin," "beautiful wreckage," "deeper frequency" trend generic in peak beats. Paragraph structure varies; no major grammatical errors.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm and varied syntax. The opening anchors voice and stakes effectively; the final image resolves through concrete detail (empty dreams, glittering surface). Information density is high in the library sequences. However, several passages rely on abstract summary rather than concrete action: "He worked for days or hours—time flowed strangely here—repairing catalogs, shelving scattered books, creating order from chaos" compresses the central labor into generic verbs. Occasional filter-verb stacks ("Marcel understood," "they'd needed") dull immediacy. Minor paraphrase loop: "suspicious absence / strange stillness" and "impossible architecture / architectural impossibility" recycle near-synonyms within close proximity. No major loops or template cadence, but compression of key beats into summary lowers propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively—short declaratives ("She decided to declare herself, but carefully") against longer accumulative phrases ("the children studying by candlelight… the elder men repairing… the women teaching"). Two minor loops: "anonymity, she realized, had limits" is paraphrased two lines later as "anonymous donations feed our bodies, but they starve something else"; and "three generations of exile" in the opening echoes structurally in "intergenerational" later without adding pressure. The final paragraph stacks three negations ("neither would exile mean… nor survival mean") that slightly muddy the closure image. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs; information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is lush and image-rich, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold. "The unused love hadn't gone nowhere—it had gone everywhere, transformed into the beauty…" restates the thesis mid-passage. "Vast reservoir of unuttered devotion" and "museums of transformed feeling" repeat the concept without advancing pressure. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "She [verb]" or "Mei [verb]," flattening rhythm. Overwriting in peak beats (stacked metaphors: "rivers of it pouring," "golden threads spiraling," "a thousand purple worlds") blurs rather than sharpens the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the middle transformation sequence where photographs disintegrate and geometric structures unfold. Opening and bridge-setting paragraphs offer vivid, specific detail without padding. However, the piece carries several paraphrase loops: "retrocognitively trapped" is explained twice in slightly different terms in paragraph two; "texture of time" and "substance of time" restate the same concept; "what she'd already known" in the final line echoes "what it remembered being" from the opening without added pressure. Stock metaphors appear in the penultimate paragraph ("time felt like soil after rain, dense with possibility, yielding yet structured") that blur rather than sharpen the image. The closure beat leans on abstract summary rather than concrete action or image, reducing propulsion at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with vivid images ("dust motes danced," "chains singing their quiet song") and good sentence variety. Information density is high in the key-decoding sequence. However, several lines carry metaphoric overload without earned payoff: "staggering grace of seeds splitting concrete" appears twice in different forms, and the phrase "patient truth" + "slow, certain return" in the final paragraph stacks abstractions. The phrase "chained liberator, now freed, chose to bind herself" toggles the bind/free concept mechanically. Minor template cadence in the middle: "She lifted... She began... She moved..." sequence flattens momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information density is high; figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("the sound of trust breaking was not sharp like glass or sudden like thunder...like a bridge cable fraying one strand at a time"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Sentence rhythm varies and accelerates through the peak beat. Minor deduction for one phrase that edges toward overwriting: "battered marvel of atmospheric collision" feels slightly ornamental in the forge paragraph, though it does not obscure the closure image. No scaffolding or synonym churn detected.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in early beats. However, figurative language clusters in peak moments without consistent payoff: "moonlight spilling out, coalescing into forms," "illuminated moment when someone's life had pivoted irrevocably" (abstract high-register phrasing), "quietly savvy understanding bloom" (mixed metaphor/stock phrase). Template cadence in the final paragraph: "Tomorrow she would [X]. Tomorrow she would [Y]. Tonight, she simply [Z]." These patterns dull closure propulsion, triggering −0.6 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is largely clean with strong imagery ("dust motes into constellations," "glowed like captured sunset," "ice fragments glittering downstream like messages"). Rhythm varies and sentence openings show variety. Two artifacts lower the score: the phrase "his voice thoughtfully spirited despite the emptiness" uses the prompt attribute as shorthand rather than showing it through action, and "weighty lightness" appears as a declared trait. Template cadence appears in the narration beats ("Now we introduce," "We must maintain," "The gather must be") but this repetition is voice-motivated by Marcus's teaching habit. Information density is high; no paraphrase loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing images are vivid. Minor scaffold appears: "fighting the familiar tightness" and "channeling her adaptive survival instincts" summarize rather than embody in action. The phrase "something breaking in her voice" (Reeves) is a stock gesture. Figurative density is controlled except for the closing thesis paragraph, which stacks abstractions ("fractured identity...sharper, clearer, more dangerous") without concrete image. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; information density is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose is largely clean. However, several phrases drift toward elevated register without clear POV motivation: "relief marbled with doubt," "topology of hope deferred," "ambered hush...marbled quiet" recur as decorative motifs rather than functional pressure. The phrase "ambered hush" and its synonym "marbled quiet" form a paraphrase loop across paragraphs. Template cadence appears in the three-silence catalog structure without variation in syntax. These patterns accumulate to −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: "locked in perpetual twilight since the Amalgamation Protocol began" does triple work (time, cause, atmosphere). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the violin sequence. Two minor artifacts: "something like wonder" and "something between melody and mathematics" use identical "something like/between" constructions within proximity (−0.3). The opening's "remarkably composed" reads slightly detached from J-7's interior voice. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Propulsion remains clear; each paragraph advances understanding or iteration state.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm and varied syntax. Strong images: "ambiguously clear patterns—neither sharp nor blurred," "keys for wings," "language beyond sound." However, several lines carry template cadence and near-paraphrase: "resonant hush" appears twice in similar constructions; "The quiet night registrar had finally stopped eavesdropping on her own life and stepped into it instead" summarizes rather than trusts the dramatized closure. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she saw," "she heard") in mid-pressure beats reduce immediacy. Information density is high but final-paragraph summary dilutes propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies effectively: short declaratives during revelation ("You're measuring something else"), longer descriptive sentences for the garden's impossible blooming. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (the wisteria dying overnight anchors time and foreshadows the garden's knowledge). One paraphrase near-loop: "He'd been designing the maze to disorient me" followed by "Making me believe I had no instinct" restates without adding pressure, triggering −0.2. Figurative language ("light through leaves," "water parting for a stone") charges beats without overwriting. The marble descriptions risk ornamental density but each ties to a specific deception. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Minor scaffolding in the husband's notebook exposition could tighten, but it doesn't obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual variety. Information density is high without padding: "mechanically warm" conveys both literal heat and nexus function. However, the phrase "obliging sky mechanic" recurs three times (opening, mid-story, closing) in near-identical form, creating a scaffold loop. "Subdued awakening/awakenings" appears twice in close proximity without reweighting. The metaphor "time moved sideways, perpendicular to causality itself" is vivid but borders on abstract without concrete grounding in Kael's perception. No major grammar or sequencing errors; clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (flood context, ghost history, decoding method all woven through action). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line ("the opera house felt complete") resonates. Clarity is strong, with one exception: "water lapping at the third rung of her chair" (chairs lack rungs). Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "She'd found it floating... its ink bleeding" and "The water damage had transformed... now a series of dots" restate transformation without added pressure. Filter-verb use is light and voice-motivated. No loops or template cadence runs. The phrase "in those in-between spaces when rehearsal ended and performance hadn't yet begun" slightly over-explains the concept already shown. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "The oracle hadn't been wrong, exactly—it had been uncertain, and its fault-tolerance had interpreted uncertainty as something to suppress rather than elevate" advances both diagnosis and theme). Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer reflective sentences during Mira's insight and shorter action beats during the redesign. No loops or scaffold; paragraph structure supports momentum. Two friction points: "auroral sorrow" appears twice in the final third, risking ornamental repetition, and "swallowed the truth of its own doubt" / "the truth it had swallowed before" recycles the "swallowed" vehicle without clear pattern-teaching. These register as minor texture issues rather than clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance setting, character reasoning, or thematic charge. The opening valve-wheel description and the recurring beaded-wheel motif carry specificity without clutter. Two deductions: the phrase "drowsy alertness" recurs identically in paragraphs one and nine without reweighting, a mild paraphrase loop. More significantly, the closure paragraph stacks abstract constructions ("psychic impressions," "weight of collective guilt pressed into stone and steel and water") that slightly dull immediacy when concrete image would sharpen the beat. No major artifacts obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and many images are striking ("Books became soil. Soil became roots. Roots became stories the trees would tell"). Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, several paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: the chronicle keeper's shift from preservation to witnessing is restated multiple times without added pressure ("she no longer sought to judge," "she chose to witness change without judgment," "She smiled in the darkness"). Template cadence runs surface in the final third: "The library crumbled. She crumbled. The world crumbled and rebuilt itself" and "Above ground, the river flowed. Below ground, the stones breathed." These artifacts dull propulsion at closure and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clean with strong individual images ("where the pines grew so dense that even noon felt like twilight," "beneath the hush of dreaming roots"). However, several passages loop thematically: the opening and closing both explain Mara's mission via similar abstract phrasing ("ordinary magic," "nurture lifelong wonder"). The phrase "ordinary magic" appears four times, functioning as a thematic tag rather than earning its recurrence through evolving context. Filter verbs cluster in reflective beats ("she'd learned," "she thought") without significant voice payoff. The eclipse description effectively compresses sensory detail, but the final two paragraphs dilute momentum with summary and planning rather than resting on the charged moment.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the tapestry and diary beats. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor scaffold appears: "Every object… spoke if you knew how to listen" and "Every whisper, every witness, every fragment" trend toward list rhythm, and the phrase "always, always worth doing" adds emphasis without new information. The Catherine discovery sequence is propulsive and clear. No loops or figurative muddle touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines do double work (e.g., "Her father had been a Cold War spymaster who taught her that the best secrets were the ones everyone could read" establishes backstory, motive, and method). Clarity is strong throughout with no pronoun ambiguity or spatial confusion. Minor scaffold appears in the backstory paragraph: "He'd written about wanting to transpose life into a new key, to take the dark machinery of espionage and tune it toward something resembling grace. He couldn't manage it." The second sentence paraphrases the first's failure without adding pressure, warranting −0.2. No loops or template cadence in peak beats; the final image sustains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies effectively, with purposeful compression in the priest's looped questions and more expansive description of the chamber. Information density is high in key moments (the palette introduction, the blue marks forming a mandala). However, several lines loop conceptually: "What assumes?" / "What assumes control requires?" / "What requires control assumes what about stillness?" cycles without advancing pressure. The phrase "decorated with/by silence" recurs three times without evolving meaning. Filter verbs and passive constructions appear frequently ("was ancient," "bore only one color," "seemed distant") in a high-stakes beat, dulling immediacy. The closure image is clean but some earlier scaffold ("He'd brought it not as decoration but as tool") reads as scaffolding rather than tight prose.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (mirrored horizon, nautilus chambers, grandfather's cosmic symphonies). Minor template cadence in the memory sequence: "Back then, the world hummed... Back then, everything meant something" is purposeful parallelism but borders on decorative. The phrase "upturned hush of dawn settled around her like blessing" in the final third layers elevated metaphor without clear propulsion. No paraphrase loops or factual breaks; clarity and grammar are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and the read-aloud test mostly passes. Line-level clarity holds except for a few overwritten moments: "brightening darkness that hurt to perceive" and "periodically eternal" stack metaphor without payoff. Paraphrase loop: "She was here, now, whole" and "one woman walking forward" in the final paragraph restate singularity with slight synonym churn. Template cadence appears mid-story: "The viaduct had appeared... sometimes moss-covered, sometimes pristine, occasionally fractured" uses parallel stems without taught pattern. Figurative language is dense in the climax ("shattered into light," "blazed bright and darkened") but mostly coherent. Minor scaffold: "This was her curse and gift" and "This was the truth" are boilerplate frames that could be cut. No major loops or artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The broken-needle discovery, backward-recording experiment, and method dissemination advance causality without padding. However, several template cadences appear: "He worked... He'd kept... He understood" in early paragraphs, and the final two paragraphs stack parallel constructions ("a way to enthrall... a victory carved... a symphony composed") that edge toward ornamental summary. The phrase "defeat transformed into something else entirely" is abstract when a concrete final image would land harder. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats, but the closing section drifts toward telling rather than showing the stakes, applying −0.4 for patterned summary in the closure zone and keeping this below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with varied rhythm and strong information density. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes effectively. Minor pattern detected: several sentences open with prepositional phrases or participial constructions in sequence ("Inside the tube," "In the margins"), creating subtle template cadence in the middle third. One paraphrase loop: the "layered tranquility" concept is restated twice without added pressure. No figurative muddle; clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in rope-reading passages. Clarity is mostly strong, though "末端" (Chinese character) appears untranslated, breaking immersion. Some template cadence: "Here: where she'd gripped hardest... There: where the rope had caught..." and minor redundancy: "particular to this voice and setting" recaps what "distinct" already conveys. The mandala formation and Sarah's flicker are vivid, but figurative density—"wound in the hillside," "dandelion seeds," "mandala of sorts"—accumulates without pattern-teaching. No major loops, but mid-pressure beats favor description over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or theme without padding. Minor scaffold: "turned the horizon amber" and "ash-laden wind" are stock weather phrases; "dusk thickened" is borderline cliché. The final image—fruit dropping into water—is clear and propulsive. No mixed metaphors or register drift. One small clarity slip: "hanging vines" appear suddenly without prior cue. Overall, the prose is clean and momentum is sustained through the performance sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance through sensory detail and metaphor simultaneously. Rhythm varies effectively between short declaratives ("It was still a lie") and longer accumulative sentences. Two distinct issues lower the score: (1) "affectionate detachment" appears identically twice, creating a label loop; (2) the phrase "As the transformation completes, she thought, reading the electrical signature" embeds an incomplete sentence fragment awkwardly. The opening and closing images are strong, and no major clarity issues obscure causality. Total deduction: −0.8 for two distinct patterns (label repetition, fragment awkwardness).

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in early beats ("the only place in town open this late," "cargo broker...shrewdness"). The line "something softer than ledgers and manifests" and later "currency of gratitude" rely on predictable business-versus-emotion diction. The closing paragraph leans into elevated register ("ancient patterns, witnesses to this new cycle") that feels slightly algorithmic rather than voice-particular. Minimal loops; one paraphrase near the end ("thank you"/"thank you") is conversational rather than scaffolding. Clarity and propulsion are strong; no artifact obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and figurative language is generally purposeful ("bark that felt like frozen starlight," "webs of kinship"). Information density is high. However, "luminescent longing" in paragraph three and "luminescent ache" as the required tone element both appear with similar construction, creating mild ornamental repetition. The final paragraph contains template phrasing: "no longer at its edge but woven into its very heart, finally understanding that belonging wasn't about..." stacks explanatory clauses that reduce propulsion. No major loops, but the closure beat could tighten by one sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "leather satchel heavy with specimen jars and charcoal sticks" anchors profession, physicality, and purpose). Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Minor slip: "Between the towers, where water catches breath before falling" and the mentor's near-identical quote feel paraphrase-adjacent, a micro-loop. Figurative language ("gossamer thing," "silk made of memory") enriches without overwhelming, though "borrowed time" recurs frequently. No major scaffolding or clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied with strong specificity ("silver milk," "seed through stone"). However, several lines loop or restate without adding pressure: "she had not solved the mathematics of emotion, but she had mapped its territory—that was enough" recaps the prior insight. The final paragraph stacks summary claims ("patient as stone, alive as grief, growing toward its own mysterious proof") where a single concrete image would land harder. Figurative density is high but controlled; no mixed metaphors. Minor template cadence in the opening third (repetitive "she had" and "her brother" constructions) but clears by midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the discovery beats. Minor scaffold appears: "She needed only to watch" + "She needed only" constructs a template stem. The phrase "sapphire hush" recurs three times, functioning as motif but risking ornament. "Achieved visibility—not as a body taking up space, but as a presence that preserved" over-explains the metaphor already enacted. No loops obscure causality or closure, keeping penalties moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory anchors (dripping trellis, trembling leaf, scent of approaching rain). Information density is high in the middle third. However, the piece carries some scaffold: "she began collecting its leaves, pressing them" recounts rather than shows a key attachment moment; "This was study too, she realized—perhaps truer than any she'd conducted" tells the epiphany rather than trusting the image. The final paragraph's "mysterious forces she'd spent years trying to control" and "finally felt like she was growing alongside her plants" loop back over ground already established, adding abstract summary where a sharper image would serve. No major loops or template cadence, but the closure beat could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify; no major loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled—"branching like neurons," "map of thirst and endurance"—without overwriting. Minor scaffold appears: "she'd been trying to capture" and "she'd been following" across adjacent paragraphs repeat the "she'd been [verb]ing" stem without new pressure. Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. The final image charges prior motifs cleanly. Propulsion suffers slightly in the Marcus exchange, where exposition slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; figurative density ("shadows grew teeth," "bright darkness") supports atmosphere without overwhelming clarity. Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "boot-strike sending discordant ripples" advances both plot and sonic motif). Minor issues: "stalactite hummed a different prophecy, every mineral vein traced probability's path" edges toward list-like parallelism; "desperate hope all seekers wore like ill-fitting clothes" is vivid but slightly stock. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The final line—"it was beautiful"—lands cleanly without scaffold. Propulsion remains strong across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (setting, interiority, and motif work). "The rain had left everything clean and bright, the white stones of the harbor gleaming like promises kept" threads sensory detail with thematic charge without overwriting. One small scaffold: "she realized as she spoke" is a mild filter, but voice-motivated. No figurative muddle, pronoun confusion, or temporal drift. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Zero text-artifact issues that obscure cause/effect or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at the dare, longer accumulative sentences in the tunnel). Clarity is high; no loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is dense ("starlit cathedral," "fractal complexity," "calcified silence") but controlled and legible. Minor overwriting: "trembling certainty, that particular state of being utterly convinced while remaining fundamentally terrified" is a paraphrase loop that could compress to one phrase. The final paragraph's "dawn's hour had arrived" is slightly redundant after "The clock struck five." Information density is strong; sentences do multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear, but several artifacts accumulate. Paraphrase loop: "mathematical curiosity, nothing more" (para 2) restates the skeptic frame already established. Template cadence in the memory-cascade paragraph: "Her grandmother... her great-grandmother... women whose names..." reads mechanical. Stock metaphor: "tears streaming down her face—not from sadness but from..." is a familiar construction. Filter-verb stack in para 9: "felt her grandmother's purpose flow through her" followed by exposition. The closure beat is clean, but mid-story scaffolding and synonym churn ("observation," "observational wisdom," "observations") dull momentum. Deduction: −0.6 for patterned artifacts across non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several prose artifacts accumulate: "feeling the magnetic fields writhe like serpents" and "understanding blooming like poison" are stock metaphors; "hushed thunder quality she'd perfected" is filter-heavy telling; "gesturing at the equations hovering in light" buries the vivid detail in a gerund clause. Template cadence appears in the opening: "He had lived... until the fragment arrived. The cursed amulet piece sat... pulsing with a rhythm." Paraphrase loop: "the fragment wasn't merely cursed. It was a key" restates without added pressure. These artifacts don't touch closure but spread across the first half, triggering −0.8 per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap. No loops in the final third; closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies well; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: "Mara had found the ink pot in his briefcase, recognized it from the estate sale of a genuine immigration attorney who'd died last month, and understood exactly what her father planned" compresses setup efficiently. No paraphrase loops. Minor template cadence in the opening exposition ("she was sixteen," "he'd say," "today's con") but it breaks before becoming intrusive. The closure beat is clean. "Deathly vitality" recurs purposefully to charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is generally purposeful ("decades pressed into compact spaces," "flowers insist on their original magnitude"). However, the piece exhibits moderate overwriting in high-detail passages: "pink luminescence refracting through the fluorescent tubes' chemical glow" stacks modifiers without adding pressure, and several beats loop conceptually—paragraphs 4 and 5 both explore compression/expansion through different examples (cherry blossoms, then maple roots) without advancing her stance. The phrase "by charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn, she had learned to map temporal resonances" uses passive perfect construction that distances the method from present action. "Incandescent restraint" as self-descriptor (paragraph 6) tells rather than shows stylistic choice. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she realized," "she had learned") appears but does not cluster heavily. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; information density is generally high. The closure image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. The opening establishes situation economically, and images like "purple light filtered through container gaps" provide specific sensory grounding. Minor scaffold appears in "She'd stopped fighting" / "Instead, she drifted" and "She began documenting" / "She started listening," where consecutive paragraph openers follow similar stems. The phrase "trying to discover the texture of memories embedded in fabric and molded plastic" uses "texture" in a way that will be repeated thematically, which reads purposeful rather than repetitive. No loops obscure the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    Syntax varies and rhythms support mood, but several passages loop thematically without advancing pressure: "Some instruments, after all, measure distances that have no units. Some compasses point toward conversations we're still learning to hear" restates the closure idea without new information. "Gloomy cheerfulness" appears twice as a label without embodiment. The phrase "inside the whisper of closing pages in her grandmother's story" is figuratively dense but abstract. No major grammatical errors; clarity is maintained. Figurative language clusters in reflective beats (shell "like a forgotten promise," cello "skeletal," threads "visible") but doesn't obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop conceptually: "perpetual carnival," "raft city," and variations on "carnival logic/language" recur without adding pressure. The phrase "hopeful desperation" followed immediately by "hope that the carnival could survive, desperation because..." is a paraphrase loop (−0.2). Metaphorical choices are coherent, though "barnacles" for gentrification and "swallowed" for the city read as stock. Sentence openings vary adequately, no major propulsion stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean and propulsive with strong sensory anchors ("pearled toward dawn," "swayed gently in a phantom breeze"). Minor artifact: "dawnlit melancholy" appears three times as a phrase, and "purposefully curious" recurs mechanically. Template cadence in the middle section: "He mixed… He positioned… He retrieved…" across sequential beats (−0.4). Some figurative language stacks without payoff ("shroud," "cathedral," "rebellion" within two paragraphs). No major loops or scaffold, and information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear, with strong concrete nouns (hummingbird, polymer patch, glass channels). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "She had been blind for three years now, ever since the welding accident that had taken her sight but sharpened everything else" is immediately restated through her sensory work; "every repair was personal, a promise that damage didn't mean the end" is echoed by "everything broken has a signature" and again by the closing line. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "she understood… she returned… she worked" creates rhythmic monotony. The metaphoric language is purposeful but occasionally stacks without tight integration: "mist rolled through... like breath through lungs" followed by "magnetic calm" and "cathedral silence" within close proximity. Information density is high in the repair sequence but dips in the thematic summary beats.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean with strong imagery ("ice crystals frosting its wings," "circles within circles"). Rhythm varies and information density is high. However, several template stems appear: "She had learned," "She had seen," "She had photographed," "She had her gear ready—had kept it ready." The phrase "worrying tranquility" appears twice verbatim. Metaphors are coherent. The final paragraph's short declarative sentences create effective cadence. Minor filtering ("She pulled out her tablet") slightly dulls immediacy. No paraphrase loops touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high; grammar and usage are clean. However, the prose carries noticeable template cadence and scaffold: "Left foot, right foot, pause" repeats verbatim; "infinitely slowly" and "infinite patience" echo; "hollow-eyed" buildings and "wild hush" read as stock descriptors. Several beats paraphrase prior content without added pressure ("slowly—infinitely slowly—the ghost town remembered how to live" restates the prior paragraph's arc). Figurative language ("heartbeat," "harmonize themselves whole," "frequency of hope") clusters without embodied grounding, and the register drifts toward abstraction ("resonance between them," "collective heartbeat") that clashes with the fable-simple diction elsewhere. The loop and scaffold artifacts do not break causality but dull momentum, especially in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence lengths modulate with pressure (short bursts during the oxygen crisis, longer syntactic builds in the reflective exit). Information density is high: most lines advance situation, character, or atmosphere. Two minor loops: "lonesome in their splendor" (paragraph re memories) echoes "lonesome splendor" (exit paragraph) without reweighting; "gathered hush" appears twice as atmosphere rather than causal element. Stock phrases "relief flooding," "understanding dawning," and "color returning" are functional but generic. No scaffold or simultaneous-action errors. Clarity and concision hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid ("skeleton of faith," "air itself was learning to hover"). However, template stems recur in the middle section: "Rooms nested...," "Stairs descended...," "And everywhere..." creates a list-like cadence (−0.4). The phrase "sustains impossibilities" appears three times in similar syntactic frames, bordering on thematic loop (−0.2). "Through the scuffs on its surface" delivers texture, but "messages from men who'd tried to thread this labyrinth" paraphrases the lattice carving without added pressure (−0.2). No artifacts touch closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly controlled. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: "through ephemeral cameo appearances at the edge of vision" and "mournful elation, like bells ringing for both funeral and feast" stack metaphor and abstraction where concrete image would sharpen. "Lovingly venomous" recurs three times (exposition, Eleanora's dialogue, final reflection) as a label rather than enacted contradiction. Paraphrase appears: "He died. I became this" could compress further. Some stock metaphor: "temperature dropped like a stone into dark water." Information density is high overall and no major loops obscure causality, but figurative excess in the closure paragraph ("whatever light waits beyond lovingly venomous mistakes") dilutes the final image's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean and rhythmically varied, with strong visual detail and no major loops or scaffolding. Information density is moderate; many sentences do two jobs (action + atmosphere). However, several phrases echo stock literary templates: "methodical grace," "devotion of someone certain her work would outlive her," "her dreams still walking those luminous corridors." The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the emotional departure. Figurative language (silk threads as veins, red stone into rose gold) is vivid but not dense enough to trigger overwriting penalties. Clarity and momentum are steady but lack the line-level propulsion expected at 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm and clarity are generally strong, with varied sentence openings and spatial anchoring. However, the piece carries paraphrase loops ("restore what was broken, to restore the connection"; "the patient work of restoration, the faithful tending") and synonym churn around "rebuild," "restore," "heal." The closing paragraphs stack filter verbs and summary constructions ("She thought of," "She would stay, she decided") that dull immediacy. Template cadence in the final third ("She picked... she pressed") and the expository tone of "the journey that had brought her here was over" lower momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Opening line ("The golden arcade gleamed in the dawn light…") anchors voice and stakes; final line ("wondering who she would be when the reply finally came") recharges the identity motif with cost. Minor scaffold detected: "carefully inventive" appears twice in identical phrasing ("this carefully inventive system," "this carefully inventive throwback"), a ~0.3 deduction for template recurrence. "Juxtaposed the morning's chalk codes against the information" is slightly elevated diction but fits Iris's analytical mind. No loops, filter stacks, or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high; sentences advance character, world, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully. However, template artifacts cluster: "She had been listening...," "She pulled her needle through again...," "She set down...," "She returned...," "She embroidered..." (six consecutive paragraph openings with identical subject-verb stem in the middle section). "Echoed silence" recurs four times, tipping from motif into synonym loop. The phrase "adjacent possibilities" is used twice but never concretely defined, reading as clever placeholder. Figurative language ("autumn wind howled," "history prepared to bend") in the final beats feels elevated but earned. Deductions: template cadence −0.6, echo loop −0.4, total −1.0.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language ("roots twisted like arthritic fingers," "spirits sang their ancient, knowing songs") is vivid without overwhelming clarity. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like "grief-hollowed face with fierce tenderness" and "fierce tenderness of her calling," where "fierce tenderness" repeats as a motif but does not evolve. The final two paragraphs summarize Meera's reflective stance rather than dramatizing a new beat, slightly dulling momentum. No major loops or template cadence, but density could tighten in the closing.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies appropriately; sentence openings diversify. Information density high: most lines advance character understanding, coral symbolism, or stakes. Figurative language concentrated but serves closure (silk scarf mist, labyrinthine conversations, polyps building from seawater). Minor template cadence in middle section: "The coordinates pointed...The brain coral's chambers...Maricel understood..." uses parallel declarative stems across three beats. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively. No paraphrase loops; proofreading clean.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or insight). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is controlled: "cracked like exposed film" anchors the concept; "light dancing across cracked plaster" closes without overwriting. Minor scaffold in "She'd been commissioned to display" (passive efficiency) and "already imagining" (weak nominalizing construction) but neither obscures causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve momentum. Zero artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high (most lines advance image, discovery, or choice). Opening anchors voice and stakes; final image ("pointing always downward") resonates. Minor loop: "dreams itself awake" / "dreaming this discovery" / "having dreamed" recurs without escalating pressure mid-story, though the recursion serves theme. One template-cadence run in the discovery sequence ("Behind it... Behind that...") is brief and pattern-taught. No major clarity issues. Figurative language ("conversation with the dead artist," "splinter," "Russian dolls") is coherent and serves the nested premise without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence openings vary and information density is high in the opening third ("gourd rattle seed—a hollowed vessel filled with peppercorns—three times, the signal that meant *sanctuary compromised*"). However, the ending paragraph accumulates figurative language without clear propulsion: "convergence," "chaos that somehow harmonized," "bloomed like defiant flowers," "roots sinking deep" stack metaphors without advancing the beat. The "He shook the gourd rattle one final time. The sound meant *begin*" pivot is clean, but the subsequent sentence ("And in seventeen minds, ancient languages bloomed...") drifts into thematic summary rather than concrete action. Minor paraphrase loops ("community garden" / "community gardens," "warp" / "warped" / "warp") slightly dull momentum. No gross artifacts, but the closure beat trades propulsion for atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled, sentences vary in structure, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent (shell/coral/photosynthesis/galaxy metaphors interlock). However, mild overwriting appears in high-concept beats: "the accumulated weight of all wars, all the centuries of longing" and "converting it through attention's light into oxygen others might breathe" add metaphor on metaphor without propulsion. No loops or scaffold detected. Template cadence does not intrude. Information density is high but occasionally tips into decorative layering rather than advancement. Line-level clarity remains strong enough to avoid artifact penalties, but the piece does not reach the propulsion needed for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly legible ("clouds drifted past like slow thoughts," "frozen music"). However, several beats loop or paraphrase: the museum's purpose is explained twice (extinction theme in paragraphs 3 and 5), and Miren's "true work" is stated then restated with synonym variations. Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph: three sentences open with "The" constructions in close succession. Stock metaphor: "lighting a small candle of sound in the vast darkness" borders on cliché. Elevated diction in peak beats ("crystalline suspension," "split-tone aria") slightly obscures immediacy. No causality break, but momentum drags in the middle reflection block.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports pacing. Information density is high in the Varesh exposition but occasionally tips into scaffolding: "Not music, exactly, but linguistic structures..." reads like clarification for the reader rather than Mira's urgent thought. Minor template cadence in the confession paragraph: "She wrote of Chen's fabrications, of her own cowardice, of how silence had felt safer"—the parallel "of" stems risk mechanical listing. No outright loops or synonym churn. The phrase "dust and possibility" in the opening and "fragile, new understanding" near the close lean stock. Figurative language (e.g., "tumblers in an ancient mechanism") supports rather than overwhelms. Proofreading clean; no grammar slips.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph structure creates visual breathing room. Information density is generally high, with lines doing double duty (setting detail that also reveals character priorities). However, multiple prose artifacts cluster in key beats: "encrypted compassion" appears three times, each time as a thematic label rather than a concrete image; "dappled resolve" is repeated; "breathed/breathes/breathing" recurs six times in near-identical constructions; the final two paragraphs loop through "trembling," "encrypted compassion," "harmonize," and "breathing" in paraphrase cycles. Template cadence appears in several passages: "She uncoiled… She began… She photographed… She sealed…" Mid-story clarity is strong, but the closure beat is dulled by abstraction and repetition. No filter-verb stacks or major grammar issues, but the figurative language around "encrypted compassion" and "breathing" becomes rhetorical rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and syntactic variety. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity is strong throughout. Minor artifactual slip: "The withering would come—it always did—but perhaps this time she could let it be natural, seasonal, rather than self-imposed" edges toward explain-everything summary at a peak beat, reducing immediacy slightly. Otherwise, line-level craft is controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative density (prism edges, featherly determined, fractured hush) stays within lyric bounds without overwhelming clarity. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic pressure. Minor loop appears in the "necessary distances" phrasing (repeated three times without added nuance). The phrase "featherly determined" is coined but not fully dramatized on the page. Template cadence appears in the backstory paragraph's list-like recounting ("he'd grown obsessed," "he'd carried," "he insisted"). No critical artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is high. The opening image (burnt feather in eddy) anchors voice and stakes. Minor issues: "spotting the first fireflies of summer" as a metaphor vehicle feels externally imposed rather than organic to the underwater setting; "shadowseam wonder" appears twice as a label without full dramatization. "Their shared exhale spotting" is grammatically strained (exhale doesn't spot). No major loops or scaffold, but a few constructions (the fireflies simile, the "captivating her voice" phrasing) reduce clarity slightly without breaking momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("pulsed with dim, cheerful light," "smooth as memory itself"). Information density is generally high. Minor scaffold appears: "She had perhaps three hours before memory fades—before the tide returned" restates the same constraint in adjacent clauses. The phrase "understanding dawning like the iridescent light around her" is a stock metaphor. Register is consistent, and no loops obscure causality. Sentence openings vary adequately, though several begin with "Marina" or "She" in the second half. No major line-level artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clean with good rhythm variation. Opening line anchors voice and concept effectively. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor scaffolding appears: "She called it 'ordering randomness,' though her mentor had called it overthinking. Perhaps both were true" reads slightly expository. "Interesting. Most chose white" is a brief paraphrase loop (the chess choice already shown). Some template stems appear: "She'd [verb]" pattern runs across setup paragraphs. No major loops or artifacts touch the closure beat. Figurative language (kelp-dripping columns, constellation-bright LEDs) serves setting without density overload.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Minor scaffold appears: "She understood suddenly" (telling the realization rather than showing it through action or image), and the final two paragraphs recycle conceptual ground ("living document," "memories ran deeper than thought," "written herself into the cosmos") without advancing the image. The phrase "moonstone cabochon dust speck" mixes scale cues awkwardly (cabochon vs. dust speck). No template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, though "obsidian grace" and "mercury" lack vehicle specificity that would ground the comparison in Kaleth's world.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm and vivid imagery ("mist clung to the water like breath on glass," "rings spread outward in perfect circles"). Information density is high in the pond-ring sequence, where physical description (interference patterns, dark and bright bands) advances thematic realization without stalling momentum. However, several mild artifacts appear: "the liminal hour before everything shifts" is somewhat stock lyric phrasing; "His hands would cut and fit and seal, but his real work was more subtle" drifts toward summary-tell. The phrase "colors that had no names, only the feeling of revelation" is elevated but vague. Sentence openings vary and no paraphrase loops are present. One template-cadence slip: "The rings revealed… The way morning light… The way a clean window…" uses parallel "The" stems across adjacent sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the opening and closing images (moonlit ridge, cracked box, aspens). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. However, several phrases repeat structural stems without variation: "he'd been," "what haunted Marcus," "another bargain, another exchange." The closing metaphor cluster ("hard softness," "armor with a door built in") stacks figurative language in adjacent lines without clear vehicle coherence, approaching overwriting. Grammar and tense are clean; spatial choreography is legible. The Text Artifact Screen finds minor scaffold but nothing that obscures causality or dulls the closure image significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("brass altitude gauge," "frosted glass," "wind through canvas"). Minor redundancies appear: "creating patterns" recurs without advancement, and the phrase "trial balloons" is invoked three times in thematic rather than causal ways. The closure beat—"weaving them together like shells and glass in a grotto polished by countless tides"—leans slightly ornamental, extending the metaphor past propulsion. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; information density is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong images ("thick as leather," "sodden ash"). Minor scaffold appears: "The legacy's burden pressed harder now" repeats the burden motif without advancing it, and "sensitively perceptive" is used twice as a descriptor rather than shown through fresh detail. One paraphrase loop in the grandfather's legacy introduction (satchel mentioned, then immediately re-described). No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("prism parapet," "dusky harmony," "mirror-maze of what might yet be," "coded lullabies") without always advancing concrete pressure—multiple beats layer metaphor where sharper action would tighten momentum. Paraphrase loop: "elusive mirage painter" in the opening and "Vesper gathered her brushes and left the echoing terrace, her grace undiminished" in the closing recycle the grace motif without new cost. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with the bell crescendo, but information density dips when abstractions ("spiritual drought," "failure of imagination") summarize stakes already shown. No major loops or scaffold, but the figurative load in peak beats (bell tolling, final stroke) competes with propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong propulsion in most beats: "She had negotiated seventeen truces in this forever war, and buried colleagues after fourteen of them collapsed" is high-density. Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (ebony clipboard as penitent's cross, celestial dance, violence compressed into sediment) serves pressure. Two minor drags: "operatively gentle—not soft, but deliberately calibrated to disarm without diminishing" is scaffold explaining the term, and "The flawed beauty of the approach lay in its honesty" summarizes rather than trusts the dramatized ritual. No loops or template cadence, but the explanatory asides slightly dull momentum in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and most lines advance character or atmosphere. "The weight of it surprised him every time, dense as grief" is sharp. Opening and closing images anchor and recharge. Two paraphrase loops lower the score: "echo of birds" / "echo dissipating" and "something cracked inside his own chest" / "felt something like grace fracture through him" restate the internal shift without added pressure. Filter-verb reliance ("He felt," "thought he heard") in the final third dulls immediacy during peak beats. No other template cadence or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is abundant ("living sculpture of restraint," "threads of golden light woven so tightly"), though density occasionally tips into overwriting in non-peak beats. The piece suffers from minor paraphrase loops: "no longer chaste in spirit though her body remained her own, no longer a courtesan but a liberator" recycles structure without adding pressure. Clarity remains high, with no major grammar or coherence breaks. Information density is moderate; some lines advance atmosphere more than plot. The final image is vivid but the penultimate paragraph front-loads interpretation ("She had unlocked more than a spell") that the image itself should carry.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse; information density is high in most beats. The opening ("uncommonly serene silence, the kind that follows a storm") and recurring "meteor hush" anchor tone effectively. However, mild scaffold appears in the reflective passages: "But discomfort wasn't enlightenment. Provocation wasn't ethical" is a two-sentence toggle pattern that edges toward template cadence, and "Not just the puppet positions... he needed to reverse his entire approach" is a paraphrase loop that restates the same idea. These patterns do not obscure closure but dull momentum slightly in the middle third, triggering a −0.5 deduction in Q7 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing images bookend with care. Information density is high in the grotto description and migration backstory. However, several lines loop conceptually: "temporary structures could carry weight that stone never would" is restated in "acknowledged an ending without pretending permanence" and again in "temporary hymns." The phrase "blushing stillness" appears twice without changed meaning. Template stems recur: "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" dominate sentence openings in the middle third. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "question mark" for the tower and "living petals" for butterflies are apt. Mild overwriting in "the violence of permanent erasure or permanent enshrinement" where simpler phrasing would serve. No major artifacts touch closure, limiting deduction under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in key beats (braiding, pouring bronze), but template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "She had cast thousands... she had never preserved... she had forgiven herself." The phrase "technically gentle" recurs three times without syntactic variation, creating a loop. Figurative language is dense ("snowmelt ardor," "green fire," "ice walls seemed to lean") and mostly coherent, though "presence" as a descriptor for the rope's shimmer is abstract. Overwriting is present but does not obscure the closure image; apply a −0.6 deduction for loops and template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is controlled (fate as nervous system, mycelial threads, communion-bread wafer). Clarity is high and no loops appear. However, the final third relies heavily on abstract summary: "transcended the tyranny of linear time," "echo and prophecy," "conversation between seeker and way" stack metaphysical claims without concrete anchoring action or sensory grounding. Template cadence in the closing paragraph ("the paths chose...," "every journey was...," "choice and destiny weren't...") creates a thesis-like rhythm that slows closure momentum (−0.4 for figurative density without pattern payoff in final beat).

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong, with information-dense sentences that advance plot and atmosphere. Two loops weaken the mid-section: "encrypted devotion" appears four times in similar phrasing, and "dusky harmony" is repeated verbatim without adding pressure. Template cadence surfaces in the excavation sequence ("She began to dig... uncovering not treasure but something more precious..."). The phrase "through schematic representations" in paragraph four reads as prompt-echo rather than organic diction. High figurative density in the final two paragraphs (bridge, covenant, harmony, surrender) borders on overwriting but remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful imagery (music box, broken pin, light-text). Rhythm varies and description integrates with action. However, several lines lean on stock constructions: "reality shifted around them" (repeated thrice), "soundless embrace," "desperate to be free." The phrase "shifting grace, Mira's teacher had called it" is exposition-dump scaffolding mid-scene. Metaphors occasionally reach ("fury so intense it seemed to warp the air") without payoff. Information density is solid in the music-box beats but sags in the cellular-memory exposition, which recounts rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence runs. "The fog beyond her windows moved with breath-like rhythm, thick as mountains of translucent glass" demonstrates figurative density without muddle. Clarity is high; spatial and temporal progression are legible. Minor scaffold appears: "She arranged...," "She closed...," "She began applying..." forms a light stem pattern across three beats, but it does not obscure causality. "Firm" appears twice in close proximity ("firmly grounded," "firmly present"), a small synonym echo. Information density is strong overall; the grinding/mixing sequence and the vision through mirror-paste advance multiple jobs per line. No loops or paraphrase that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings show strong variety. Information density is high: most lines do double duty (e.g., "The blue silk had faded to grey over the years" establishes time passage and Marta's care simultaneously). One paraphrase loop appears mid-story: the explanation of "deciduous vows" is stated by the narrator, then restated by Lena in dialogue, covering the same conceptual ground. Minor scaffold in "endearingly feisty even in anger" reads as authorial label rather than embodied trait. The final image is strong and concrete, avoiding summary. No clarity issues; grammar and pronoun references remain clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "fear itself had learned to phosphoresce," "soil of crushed starlight," "water spiraling up a drain." Several metaphors blur under scrutiny (phosphorescent fear; spiraling upward against gravity). The phrase "simply complicated" recurs without concrete grounding, reading as placeholder. Paraphrase loop near the end: "only cultivated, only lived, only passed along" restates the same concept three ways without added pressure. Template cadence in the exposition-heavy opening ("She had inherited... who had inherited... who hadn't been born yet") stacks clauses mechanically. These artifacts pervade but do not fully obscure causality, staying within the Q7-only penalty range (−0.8 for density + coherence + loop).

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language (shelves branching like neural pathways, features phasing between ages) is vivid and controlled. The piece avoids scaffold loops and maintains clarity. However, several high-register abstractions appear in peak beats without concrete anchors: "frequencies that bypassed ears entirely," "knowledge that couldn't exist in conventional reality," "lessons yet unlearned" (repeated twice in the final paragraph). The closing phrase "The mountain would keep its library, but now it would share" tells the resolution rather than showing a specific image or action that embodies the new exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies well; sentence openings shift; figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated ("rewriting the coastline," "phantom music," "drifting too far out"). Information density is high. Minor loop: "the garden of forgotten names" repeats three times without functional variation, and "narrative threads" appears twice in similar phrasing. The phrase "trapped in the freedom" in penultimate paragraph tells theme rather than letting the final image carry it. Proofreading clean; no major artifacts, but paragraph six's "blissfully aberrant" feels like prompt fulfillment rather than organic voice at that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and information density is generally high. The opening line ("existed in the wrong time") anchors voice and stakes. However, several paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "the door…had been sealed…Yet here it stood, open and waiting" restates the same surprise; "translate confusion into clarity…make sense of the senseless" cycles near-synonyms without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle section with repeated "The [noun]" + past-tense structures. Figurative language occasionally muddles: "fables of absence…tales about what wasn't there rather than what was" doubles back on itself. The phrase "carrying with her the clear complexity of truth finally arranged into its proper configuration" stacks abstract nominalizations that blur concrete sense.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but two patterns accumulate: "gently luminous" repeats identically across three uses, and several sentences open with "The" in close succession (chambers 1–3). The metaphor "ripple marks like waves frozen mid-crash" is specific and apt; "bloom of hush" as extended figure remains coherent. Clarity is strong, with no ambiguous pronouns or sequence errors. The piece avoids loops and scaffold in most beats, but the repeated "gently luminous" phrasing and minor template cadence in the cave-descent sequence ("He sat cross-legged... placed both palms... closed his eyes") slightly flatten momentum. No figurative muddle in peak beats; the stone's activation remains imagistically clear.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.0)
    Figurative language appears frequently without pattern-taught payoff ("prayers in disguise," "frost flowers," "glass-song and thistle-hope," "shards of hush"). Paraphrase loops are minimal, but several lines restate concepts: "coincidences were prayers" / "coincidences... were simply meaning waiting to be proven." Template cadence in the middle section: "The first location... The second marked... The third indicated..." without variation. Elevated register ("retrocognitively blessed," "coherence," "convergence") does not match the urgency of rekindling a failed beacon. Information density is moderate; several beats summarize future intention rather than advancing present action.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    Syntax varies and information density is high, but several artifacts lower the score: "preemptively nostalgic weight" and "deepening hush" appear as stock metaphor pairings; "whispering" recurs three times without reweighting; "shadow lengths at monuments" and "temporal depth" feel like exposition toggles. The phrase "becoming memory, becoming monument, becoming the bridge" is a template triad that risks synonym churn. No paraphrase loops, but the closure beat leans on parallelism ("what was and what would be") that dulls specificity. Propulsion is strong until the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening long immersive lines contrast with clipped dialogue mid-scene. Information density is high: "burned hands" signals shared failure without backstory dump, mosaics serve as both setting and instruction archive. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor deductions: "serious playfulness dancing in her eyes" mixes metaphor (playfulness doesn't dance spatially), and "the hush of a night with no stars" borders poetic stock phrasing. The final paragraph stacks several abstracted summary clauses ("who he might become," "different kinds of darkness") that slightly dilute the prior embodied momentum. Propulsion is strong through mid-scene but eases into thematic wrap at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is largely clean with strong rhythm and sentence variety; opening and closing images anchor effectively. Information density is high in the tidal-pool observations and cicada reveal. Template-cadence slip: repeated sentence stems in the middle section ("Chen [verb]..." / "Mira [verb]...") create mild monotony across three consecutive beats. The phrase "the pause in their difficult conversation had opened something neither had anticipated" in the final paragraph is slightly scaffolding-like, summarizing rather than showing the shift. Filter verbs ("he heard," "he foresaw") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No loops or clarity issues at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, setting, or thematic charge. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, accelerating during the chase and breathing in reflective beats. Minor template cadence in the final section: three consecutive paragraphs open with "She chose" / "She chose" / "She chose," creating intentional parallelism that borders on mechanical. One paraphrase loop: "stretched infinite" (paragraph 2) and "stretching-contracting sky" (final paragraphs) recur without added pressure. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "cloudvines...reaching toward earth instead of heaven" works, though "intangibly tangible" in paragraph 6 remains abstract despite embodiment attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically controlled, with varied syntax and vivid images ("liquid color," "vaulting hush," "fern patterns"). The phrase "fluidly logical certainty" and "catalyze all your memories into a single note" drift toward elevated, abstract diction that clashes with the gondola operator's lived-in POV. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but "vaulting hush" recurs three times, risking template cadence. Information density is high; sentences layer action, description, and interiority without padding. The storm-glass and prism descriptions occasionally tilt ornamental (e.g., "geometric marvel of refracted light") when simpler anchoring would maintain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the chapel and orchard beats. Two issues lower the score: "her scanner crackling against the chapel's wall" then "Each frequency pulse peeled back another era" is paraphrase-loop (−0.2). The phrase "make her pulse quicken with the kind of wisely adventurous certainty that separated historians from treasure hunters" is register drift into authorial commentary (−0.3). Final paragraph's "she was a lore keeper" summary flattens momentum slightly. Otherwise propulsion is strong and figurative language ("light parted like beaded curtains") is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is mostly clear with strong images (doorknocker from melted wedding bands, scars like embroidery, footprints in ash). Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports the contemplative tone. However, multiple filter-verb stacks appear in high-pressure beats ("watched it," "recognized the pattern," "understood"), dulling immediacy. The final paragraph contains paraphrase loops: "suffocating became the breathing" restates "how to make suffocating breathe" without added pressure. Metaphor density is high but mostly coherent; "loaded emptiness" and "beautiful devastation" edge toward oxymoron without clear grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting is pervasive: "cathedral of living stars," "sea of liquid light," "symphonic brilliance" stack figurative language in nearly every paragraph without escalation. Mixed metaphor: mushrooms glow, cast shadows in seventeen directions (physically implausible without multiple point sources, unexplained), then become "liquid light." Template cadence in the backstory block: "how it could... how it turned... how to smile... how to comply..." Paraphrase loop: "pressure could also create beauty. Carbon crushed long enough became diamond. Suffering endured with awareness became wisdom" restates the same idea three times. Propulsion stalls under ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally with strong opening and closing images. Clarity is high, no grammar or continuity errors, and information density is good across most beats. However, several lines carry mild scaffold or near-paraphrase: "understanding flooding through him like cold water" is a stock embodiment; "Golden shadows had deepened to violet now" repeats the "golden shadows" motif without adding pressure; "this proof that his intuition had been correct" restates the bridge metaphor. The final two paragraphs loop thematic language ("eloquently silent," "bridge of intuition," "secrets, waiting") in a way that feels like recapitulation rather than propulsion. Minimal figurative muddle, but the elevated register ("amber light filtered through the towering windows") is consistent enough to read as voice rather than drift. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase and thematic echo in the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing images are vivid. Information density is high—most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The knight had come here seeking solitude after his disgrace, but solitude had taught him only to watch" restates the withdrawn premise; "the space between what was and what could be" and "capturing the shape of possibility" recycle the same concept. Template cadence in the climax ("he began to murmur," "the trees swayed," "the vast marionette master waited") flattens propulsion. Figurative density ("gossamer filaments," "strings ascending," "crossbars rotated") clusters without clear escalation pattern. Apply −0.6 for loops/template stems, −0.3 for figurative density in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: "forgotten promises," "chaotic years after the war," "the gulf of decades" are specific and propulsive. Information density is high (each paragraph advances discovery or stakes). Minor loop: "These unknown histories deserved to be magnified, spoken, remembered" restates the theme without added pressure (−0.2). The final beat "She could still bear witness. That would be enough" edges toward summary, but the prior archival actions (cross-referencing, historical society contact) provide concrete grounding. No filter stacks or template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance situation, character, or world. Clarity is strong throughout. Two paraphrase loops appear: "Everyone dismissed her" / "That underestimation had kept her alive" restates the same idea across adjacent sentences; "small acts, easily dismissed, but cumulatively devastating" / "The resistance wasn't spectacular. It was persistent" echoes the same thematic claim in close proximity. The phrase "carefully resourceful resisters" and later "careful resourcefulness" repeats the prompt language without transformation. Apply −0.4 for loops and scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines doing double work (e.g., dewdrops both anchor time and foreshadow the prism effect). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "through negative space" is restated three times in close proximity; "quietly" recurs as a modifier in multiple paragraphs without fresh angle; "each one" anaphora in the final paragraph feels template-driven. The phrase "some truths could only be unmade through negative space—by playing around them, defining their absence until they collapsed into silence" repeats the same idea within one sentence. Figurative language density is high but controlled, with no mixed metaphors touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "building tiny monuments to forgotten things" is restated across paragraphs six and seven; "emerged transformed always" echoes "She emerged transformed always from these encounters." Template cadence in paragraph eight: "She began to build… she arranged… Each tiny monument hummed…" The phrase "mossy delight" (paragraph seven) and "hush where past meets prophecy" (used three times) approach stock metaphor without fresh grounding. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent. These artifacts touch multiple beats; applying −0.6 for loops and −0.4 for template stems, total −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening (workshop, waterfall, magnifying glass, seven years compressed efficiently). However, the middle section leans on stock constructions: "He'd been collecting," "People said," "Marcus recognized it immediately." The phrase "the way things broke and sometimes, through patience, found new purpose" borders on theme summary rather than image. The final paragraph stacks modifiers ("uncertainly certain nature of being alive") and the compass description—"pointing everywhere and nowhere, which was exactly where he needed to go"—edges toward purple. No major loops, but figurative density in the closing beat slightly obscures propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and image. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor issues: "luminous regret" recurs without reweighting (line-level echo), and "terrible gravity" + "terrible, suspended hope" repeats the modifier within close range. "The weight of a name that had never stopped meaning something to someone" edges toward abstraction. No loops or scaffold; propulsion is clear. Artifacts are non-closure and minor, capping deduction at −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, and stakes. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor register drift: "modestly fearless in the way of those who've faced death enough to know its textures" reads slightly elevated for the established voice during a physical descent, though it remains character-motivated. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs ("hidden sunrise" / "waking canyon"). No scaffold or text artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong imagery: "dumped like medical waste," "pain became language," "ultraviolet spectrum was the only light that didn't make me remember." Rhythm varies appropriately. Specific friction: "She found him in the clearing's center—an old man sitting cross-legged" is efficient, but the transition from walking to finding him is abrupt. "Bracing herself not against pain this time, but against the terrifying possibility of peace" uses contrast effectively but leans slightly abstract. Minor filter-verb presence ("feeling," "let her feel") in early paragraphs is voice-motivated. No loops or template cadence. Information density is high; each sentence advances.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong propulsion and varied syntax. Information density is high in the market and lens-reveal beats. Two paraphrase loops appear: the vendor's explanation of the lighthouse keeper's view repeats the paintings' layered-city concept, and the final paragraph cycles through "between things" twice within three sentences. Template cadence in the exhibition paragraph ("she began to document… the paintings became… these were") stacks three parallel constructions without variation. Figurative language (splitting light, compressed time) serves the closure without overwriting. No major grammatical issues or filter-verb stacks. The loops and cadence run merit a modest deduction but do not obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.7)
    Syntax varies purposefully: short declaratives ("Marcus set down his toolbox") to longer, nested observations ("Here, the dust lay thick and undisturbed, but there, along one tile's edge, the gray film showed disturbance"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or discovery. One minor scaffold: "he'd been called here because…" could tighten. The final paragraph stacks three phrases ("Some burdens… Some cracks… Some secrets…") in purposeful parallelism that charges the image. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by action. No figurative muddle in peak beats. Propulsion is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and syntax serves the fable-like tone, but several passages stack figurative language without clear propulsion: "almost like words, almost like code, almost like the truth" and "either way, you'll stop compressing eternity and start experiencing moments" lean abstract where concrete image would sharpen. Template cadence appears in "Real. Imperfect. Alive." (three one-word fragments) and the operator's packing description feels like scaffold. The final aphorism ("awakening always feels like falling until you remember how to fly") risks cliché and tells rather than letting the image speak. Clarity remains high; information density is good in the middle third but softens at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "revolution taught you to read symbols the powerful tried to hide" establishes expertise, motive, and interpretive lens). Rhythm varies appropriately. Two minor artifacts: "reimagining civilization" appears three times without enough functional variation, creating a template feel. "Burnished sorrow" in the closing paragraph reads slightly elevated relative to the established register. No loops or clarity breaks, but the repetition of core thesis language ("reimagining," "baroque excess," "brokenness") across multiple beats trends toward synonym churn in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is largely clean with strong rhythmic control and purposeful detail. Information density is high: most sentences advance understanding of problem or solution. Modest loop/scaffold issues: "the melody darkened rooms, that candles guttered" and "light stolen by midnight" recur without added pressure; "whispered" and "worry-worn" are stock descriptors. The phrase "a testament to the small magics that repair the world one gear at a time" in the closing verges on abstraction that dulls the concrete image of echoes singing. Figurative language (covenant of rust, oxidized joy) is coherent and purpose-driven. No grammatical errors or unclear pronoun references.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings shift, and information density is high (most lines advance character, world, or pressure). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity is strong throughout. Minor overwriting: "resonant hush" appears three times; "the place where..." construction recurs ("the place where sound behaved strangely," "the place where explanations fail," "the place where measurement instruments spun"). These near-repetitions slightly dull propulsion in the middle third. The final image—compass stilling, dive into "primordial storms"—is vivid and propulsive. No filter-verb stacks or stock metaphors in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance perception, discovery, or decision. Rhythm varies naturally with no template cadence. Minor scaffold appears: "She thought of her sculptures... She thought of Eleanor Strand..." creates a brief stem-repetition pattern (~mid-story) that could tighten. The final paragraph edges toward overwriting with stacked metaphor ("transparent layer, humming with the turbine-song of time itself") but remains legible. No loops or paraphrase chains. Sentence openings vary; clarity holds throughout. One stock phrase: "catching her breath" in the archway.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies appropriately; sentences compress under emotional pressure ("She finally knew what to paint") and expand during reflective beats. Information density is strong—most lines serve dual function (postcards are both object and thematic vehicle; amber glass both setting and metaphor). Two minor loops reduce clarity: "through the hidden layers of etched glass in a cathedral window" appears twice with identical phrasing (paragraphs 6 and 7), and the autumn/spring timeline contradiction (opening "winter's last snow" versus closing "autumn evening") creates a scaffold artifact. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; propulsion remains clean through the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear with strong images (copper clouds, obsidian mirror, ribbed sand). However, several passages rely on abstract phrasing and metaphorical density that slow momentum: "searing reverie," "benediction," "covenant was sealed," "unbearable truth" stack without concrete anchoring. The phrase "retrocognitively trapped" is clinical and voice-foreign. Paraphrase loops appear: "couldn't speak about what he'd seen" / "had to reach the lagoon" / "understood immediately" recycle stems across adjacent beats. The final two paragraphs summarize rather than propel, with lines like "some testimonies weren't stored in climate-controlled vaults" reading as thematic placeholder. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with scene needs, but figurative language in high-pressure beats (the parley, the looking) trends decorative rather than knife-edge specific.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing images are strong. Information density is high in the bottle-examination and nightly-work passages. Minor loop: "She remembered..." x3 in one paragraph uses identical stems without escalation between iterations. Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed metaphor: "wishes were parasites" feeding on "possibility until nothing remained but the empty husk"—the vehicle shifts from biological parasite to plant remains. "Architecture of hope" and "mind's crucible" are stock metaphor strings. No clarity-breaking artifacts, but these small slips accumulate to −0.5 to −0.7 from an 8.0 baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clean with strong images ("apple blossoms fell all at once," "honey and ash"). However, scaffold phrases recur: "she handed him" appears twice in parallel beats, and "Madame Verity smiled and spoke" mirrors earlier "beckoned...speaking." The phrase "velvet disquiet that settled" and "desperate urgency" lean toward stock metaphor. Information density is solid in the child sequence but thins in the adult return, which largely restates the premise. No major loops or clarity breaks, but peak moments favor declaration over embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with vivid images (ice thick enough to distort stars, frost retreating like glass tears). Minor overwriting: "furiously tranquil" recurs as an abstract label without fresh embodiment; "wild serenity" and "rough as burlap... slick as oil" pile metaphor at the spiral entry without grounding in Mara's physical sensation. Template cadence in one sequence: "They contained... They contained..." (two adjacent sentences). Information density is high but some figurative language (the probability hatchling "solidifying with each pass into something with wings and purpose") adds texture without causal clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, setting, or stakes. Sentence variety supports rhythm ("The rope trembled. Not the rough jerk... but a deep thrumming"). Minor scaffold: "her motivation had always been to favor listening over noise" could be leaner; "the kind that spawned the deadly horizontal tornadoes that had killed eleven people five winters ago" carries slight exposition drag. No loops or metaphor muddle at closure. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve cleanly. Propulsion is steady through the storm sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully between lyric reflection and tactile action. Information density is high in world-building (dissolved corporation, automated payments, seven years) but several sentences loop conceptually: the "falling/flying" insight appears three times in different phrasings, and "watching and cleaning, cleaning and watching" is decorative reversal. Template cadence emerges in the middle third: "She'd learned..." "She thought about..." "She returned to..." "Some might call..." The final paragraph's "surrender itself was a kind of strength, that vulnerability was the only honest relationship" stacks abstract nominalizations where image would charge harder. Figurative language is controlled but occasionally stacked ("primal elegance," "flourishing stillness," "permeable, present, powerful") without earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in beats like the box description and letter reading. Clarity is strong with no loops or synonym churn in key moments. Minor scaffold appears in transitional phrases ("Today she found something new," "They came as shadows lengthened") that could be tighter. Figurative language is controlled and grounded ("light like captured honey," "morning mist"), with no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: "unspoken apologies, smothered love, honest anger buried beneath false peace" restates the covenant theme without advancing pressure. No grammar or punctuation errors; pronoun references are clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Clarity and concision are strong in most beats: "After the Shift, when numbers changed meaning and calendars became decorative relics" compresses world-building efficiently. Minor scaffold appears in "After the visitor left, Mira added the urn fragment to her collection, a damaged time capsule of sorts—not buried intentionally but shattered by the world's transformation," where the appositive slightly paraphrases the preceding image. The phrase "suddenly timeless" recurs three times (visitor's grandmother, Mira's final statement, closing line), edging toward pattern without clear escalation. No major loops or figurative muddle touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and most lines do double duty (e.g., "scales caught the emerging sunlight, scattering bronze and green" advances image and motion). Strong propulsion through the drake sequence. However, the piece carries mild figurative density in peak beats ("beauty had visited her again, dressed in loss and wonder") and a paraphrase loop in the final paragraph: "what she kept forgetting: wholeness wasn't the goal. The goal was to remain warmly attentive..." restates the same realization. The closing "harmonizing discord into something almost like peace" echoes the Method element too neatly rather than charging it with fresh cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or the remodeling project. Sentence rhythm varies naturally and accelerates appropriately in the transformation sequence. Template cadence appears in the middle section with repeated "She [verb]" constructions across multiple beats ("She started," "She rewired," "She opened," "She transplanted"), creating a mild drumbeat effect (−0.4). One paraphrase loop: the architect's diary insight about respect/tolerance appears in both the diary quote and Maren's final entry with only slight variation (−0.2). Figurative language ("morning fog," "veins carrying intention") remains controlled and doesn't obscure clarity. Grammar and pronoun reference are clean. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. No simultaneous-action errors or major scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with most lines advancing character understanding or thematic layering. The amber passage efficiently demonstrates homecoming's paradox without scaffolding. Minor template cadence appears in mid-section exposition ("The aliens had arrived...The question had fractured...Her colleagues called it..."), applying −0.3 for three adjacent summary constructions, though these remain functional rather than purely ornamental. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks mar peak beats. The closing image—rain continuing "its quiet music against stone"—charges prior motifs without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong sensory anchors and varied syntax. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Information density is high: most sentences advance image, character knowledge, or world detail. Figurative language is controlled—"twilight painted the horizon in shades of ash and violet" is fresh; "contradiction settle into his bones" is stock but brief. The dead-language phrases risk ornamental clutter but remain sparse enough not to stall momentum. Minor hedge: "he thought this place would become" could be tighter. The final paragraph's repetition of "thanking" is purposeful parallelism, not churn.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high ("breathing steam and rust," "tinted revelations poured from his speaker in waves of static and voice"). Figurative language is purposeful: the leaf's veins "branching like roads," the scrapyard "like iron cancer." Paraphrase loop: "We were trackers once, weren't we, girl? You found bodies, and I found voices in the dead grooves of history" restates prior material without new pressure, costing −0.2. Template cadence in the middle paragraphs ("He kept it," "He brought it," "He played it") creates mild repetition. The phrase "tinted revelations" appears only in narration, not earned through scene image. The final beat "grooves worn into earth by those who had always known" stacks metaphor without sharp clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in descriptive passages. However, several beats loop thematically without advancing pressure: "blessed pariah" appears twice as framing device; "true north" is restated in the compass-rose beats and again in the final paragraph. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "From one corner… From another… In the third…" The closing paragraph's "alone but never lonely, charting the infinite permutations" stacks near-synonyms. Figurative language is dense ("geological strata," "patient unfolding," "plasticity," "malleability") but mostly coherent. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she'd been," "she understood," "she could watch") slightly dulls immediacy in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structures. However, figurative density is high throughout ("sky the color of old brass," "secrets written on rice paper thin as wishes," "cautious abandon, the way one might pet a wolf") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff that narrows options. Several phrases risk poetic abstraction: "embrace the unknown with open arms" and "apprenticed himself to wonder" read as thematic shorthand rather than embodied action. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the elevated register persists in peak beats where grounded interiority would sharpen pressure. Information density is solid; no scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong imagery ("stone ear," "luminous absence," "slow unbinding of civilization"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold detected. Minor issues: "benevolently ruthless" and "nomadic penumbra" are coined but feel slightly elevated for the POV without embodied grounding. The phrase "luminous absence" recurs but borders on thematic echo rather than fresh perception. The archivist's introduction is efficient but slightly abrupt, eliding the social negotiation of two strangers meeting.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character interiority, or thematic pressure. Rhythm varies effectively, with longer contemplative sentences balanced by sharp declaratives ("She made her choice."). However, repetitive conceptual phrasing weakens momentum: "buried talents," "buried her true name," "burial seemed safer than blooming" recycles the burial metaphor without escalating meaning. Template cadence appears in the reflection段: "She saw herself... She saw why she'd fled... She had been trying..." clusters identical sentence openings. The figurative language is dense ("mercury-glass," "hidden thunder," "seed," "blooming," "feather's texture") but mostly coherent, though "seed doubt over certainty" and "seed itself across the valley" within close proximity creates minor lexical echo.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentences are clear and varied; no major loops or template cadence. Information density is high in the decoding sequence. Two frictions lower the score: "fierce repose" in paragraph nine reads as elevated diction imported from the prompt rather than earned through the POV's lexicon, and the final paragraph ("how to forgive the player behind the pieces") stacks abstract phrasing where a concrete image would sharpen closure. No artifacts touch causality, so penalties remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with strong imagery ("vertebrae from the canyon floor," "fog coil around its base like breath"). However, the piece suffers from mild template cadence in places: "She was a defiant artist... she had been there... she had done nothing" and repetitive structural patterns. The metaphor of truth-as-prism is developed consistently but borders on over-explanation in the middle section. Information density is good overall, though a few beats paraphrase without adding pressure (the elder's grave face "beneath his hood" moment). No major loops or artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening (groaning workshop, thirty seconds, burning lungs anchor urgency and constraint). The 45th-pockmark beat is clean and propulsive. However, the final paragraph leans into summary mode ("she would map," "teach others," "transform their world") rather than concrete next action, and several lines recycle abstract phrasing: "meaning conjured from the edge of oblivion" echoes "meaning crystallized like gold," and "quilting together memories" appears twice without added pressure. Stock metaphor "veins of precious metal" and "seared her throat" are functional but unearned specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean with strong sensory specificity ("bleached white by salt and sun," "green-gold of seaweed"). Information density is high in the cave sequence; each detail advances discovery or choice. Minor scaffold appears in the backstory paragraph: "She'd made herself a promise...to paint something that mattered before she forgot why she'd started" then repeats the promise concept in the next paragraph. The final paragraph stacks thematic statements that paraphrase each other: "art wasn't about permanence or audience," "allowing herself to be broken open," "intimacy didn't require proximity—only truth," and "nostalgia was just another form of distance" all gesture at the same realization. Template cadence in the closing: "Where...Where..." parallel construction feels slightly mechanical. No major loops, but the ending's repetitive conceptual packaging reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is generally strong, but several passages drift into near-paraphrase loops: "Sometimes the fiercest love speaks most quietly... Sometimes tenderness screams loudest in its silence" restates the same idea. The final three paragraphs stack thematic summary rather than advancing image or action, dulling momentum. "Background said" is a typo that breaks the closure beat. Figurative language ("like light through breaking clouds") is serviceable but not dense enough to trigger overwriting penalties. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but the ending lingers in reflection rather than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively ("The phone rang at midnight, as it had every night since she'd arrived" versus the longer device-assembly sequence). Information density is high: the jacket description simultaneously establishes character, world-state, and thematic direction. Minor template cadence appears in "traced…remembering…moved" sequence and the "Green toward…black toward" construction feels slightly mechanical. The "fish-line wrapped around her heart" is vivid but borders on stock metaphor. Closure image ("began to build in earnest") is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: "fractured something essential," "brutal honesty replaced social grace," "weight in her palm felt significant" all advance character and world efficiently. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. One minor slip: "psychological minefield" and "cultivating psychological safety" lean on the same clinical register within a short span, creating faint repetition. Rhythm modulates well—short sentences at the glass-eye discovery, longer ones for reflection. Opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly controlled ("question mark," "mist pressed…with damp fingers"). However, several artifacts cluster: "the police had overlooked" / "he'd found" / "the woman had rented" stack filter verbs; "that's what keepers do" is a stock closer; "borrowed memories" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment in peak beats. The phrase "witnessed isolation" in the final third reads generic rather than specific. One paraphrase loop: "the man hadn't come here to die. He'd come to deliver something" restates in adjacent sentences. Information density is high elsewhere, but these patterns prevent higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies well, information density is high, and the opening/closing lines frame the arc cleanly. Most beats advance without scaffold. However, three pattern issues reduce momentum: (1) synonym loops ("the doorway of decisions" repeated verbatim four times across the piece), (2) the visions paragraph lists three alternate Martins in parallel template cadence ("One Martin... Another... A third..."), and (3) slight overwriting in the final paragraphs—"Tomorrow, he would... But perhaps... Or join... Or simply..." recycles the conditional structure four times, diluting propulsion. The "as the creek rises" refrain is purposeful callback, but the other loops are not taught patterns. Clarity remains high; no causality break, so penalties stay in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at key beats: "Inside, the walls wept light"), and figurative language is vivid ("starlight that dripped... in rivulets," "fireflies... like reversed stars"). However, several phrases lean on stock constructions: "bleeding starlight" recurs without evolving mechanics, "calcified heart" is metaphor-label without embodied specificity, and "lacy with menace" (oracle and grotto both) is repeated without transformation. The final line's "wound that might, finally, teach her how to heal" stacks modifiers and reads as therapeutic wish rather than concrete image, dulling closure propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("mathematical poem written in calcium and memory," "testimony," "texture of doubt and hope braided together"), creating lyric texture but also overwriting in high-pressure beats where clarity would serve better. Paraphrase loop present: "the weight of a moment—the way this exact configuration of particles and feeling will never exist again" restates "density of presence" from prior lines without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence: repeated "I've been" / "I want" / "I'll be" stems across Solène's dialogue (−0.4). Scaffold: "scientifically romantic in its precision" and "directed spontaneity" read as ornamental intensifiers. Mixed metaphor: "palette of resolve" (visual tool) applied to abstract determination. Stock phrase: "intimate as breath." Information density is moderate; many lines do two jobs (image + theme) but some merely restate. Overall, the prose is ambitious but cluttered in peak moments, preventing clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character or thematic recursion. However, paraphrase loops appear: "chronologically confused" is explained immediately after naming, and "time was soup now, everything floating, nothing solid" restates the prior metaphor without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in the dream catalog: "Dreams where she could soar…Dreams where she attended…Dreams where she lived backward" across three consecutive beats. Stock metaphor: "edges curling like dried leaves" in the opening. The figurative language is controlled but occasionally stacks without pattern-teaching (birch bark ink, deer sinew, cedar box appear in quick succession as symbols of durability). No filter-verb stacks or severe artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the final image clean.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "dawn's fog" and "drowning heartbeat" establish both setting and tone). Two minor scaffold patterns: "She had been... Now she..." template in the opening, and "The shop's owner... he said... he gestured" in consecutive beats. One paraphrase loop: the screw's meaning is articulated twice in adjacent paragraphs ("evidence of ordinary miracles" / "talisman of beginnings"). Figurative language is dense but coherent; no metaphor muddle. Clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no loops or paraphrase cycles. Information density is high: "crow quill trimmed tip" establishes mother's legacy and tool function in one phrase. Figurative language (frost on winter glass, liquid moonlight) is controlled and motivated. Action sequence is clear (dip quill → trace rune → see memory → move to next scar). Minor drag: "as she walked toward the chain-path leading home" could compress to "as she reached the chain-path," but the beat remains propulsive. Zero artifacts touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies (short urgent lines during the vortex, longer reflection on the affair). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. The opening anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Minor: "imperfect miracle" and "induced current" recur as thematic labels without always earning fresh metaphorical weight; the final orchard image is vivid but "falling like forgiveness" leans toward stock simile. Clarity and propulsion are strong; no artifact obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "time fold around her like origami," "rumors that bent like light around a black hole," "sound had learned to whisper," "words were translations of a single, infinite utterance." In peak beats (the Hiccup, the transformation), metaphor stacks without grounding—"consciousness expanded outward while her sense of separation contracted inward" is conceptually clear but lacks concrete anchors. Paraphrase loops appear: "reality spiraled inward on itself" / "spirals forced perspective to shift continuously" restate the same image. The phrase "resounding hush" appears twice with minimal reweighting. Information density is moderate; many sentences elaborate theme rather than advancing situation, and the closure paragraph summarizes state ("no longer entirely herself") rather than showing the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance multiple dimensions (world, character, concept). Rhythm varies naturally without template patterns. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language is controlled and coherent: "razor edges" operates literally (the key) and metaphorically (time's nature) without mixing vehicles. Sentence openings vary. Minor observation: "eminently peculiar" appears twice, once as narratorial voice and once in dialogue-adjacent thought, creating slight echo but not a true loop. Propulsion is consistent; no scaffolding or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("island of yellow light in a sea of grey June water," "liquid shadow"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: the opening establishes "patterns emerged from chaos" which is restated as "chaos was the only meaning," then revisited in "create order from disorder." The penultimate paragraph runs long with multiple restatements of the central insight. "Lucid contradictions" appears twice as a phrase and the list structure ("She loved...She preached...") feels template-driven. Information density is high in the lantern-discovery beat but thins in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; the glass harmonica description integrates action and atmosphere without stalling. Opening and closing lines frame the shift cleanly. Deductions: "melodically haunted" appears three times in close proximity (disc description, performance beat, tone discussion), creating mild synonym churn. "Between the hum of streetlamps" as timeframe is poetic but functionally vague—does it recur nightly or mark a unique window? The phrase "loops, repetition, attachment" is a list that could compress to "attachment through repetition."

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean with varied sentence structure and strong sensory detail. Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Minor loops: "haunted euphoria" appears twice (photo description, Mrs. Corvin's smile); "steep" recurs three times in close proximity (inscription, returnees' explanation, Maren's reflection). Template cadence in final paragraph: "And she would use walnut ink, as always, to make sure it looked as important as it felt" echoes the earlier phrase too closely. No artifacts touch closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear. The opening image (ivy through broken windows) and closing frame (ivy-covered station) create purposeful bookends. Minor loops appear: "desperately jocular" recurs three times in similar phrasing, and "disaster relief for those who'd forgotten they were disasters too" is near-paraphrase of "cure for loneliness" and "so bloody lonely." The transition "Over the following days, others arrived" compresses time efficiently, and the "permission" triad is concise. No major filter-verb stacks or template cadence. The final summary paragraph ("they still disappeared… built the infrastructure… when asked how…") flattens momentum slightly by telling future behavior rather than landing on a single charged image, but clarity and information density remain solid throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and most lines advance atmosphere or character. However, several paraphrase loops and near-synonym patterns appear: "absorbed them through her skin as she did all languages" restates the premise unnecessarily; "unmappable terrain" / "unmapped void" / "uncharted depths" cycle through the same concept. Template cadence in "She pulled out... She walked... She knelt..." across structural beats. Figurative density—"vowels and consonants in a language older than stone," "translucent," "quiet blaze"—occasionally stacks without clear propulsion. The closure beat remains legible despite these patterns, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance concept or character (the pen functions as worry object, then transformation tool, then writing instrument). Rhythm varies purposefully and the opening grounds voice and stakes efficiently. Two minor artifacts: "through contingent relationships between" appears twice in close succession (paragraph nine and ten) as near-paraphrase, and "the signals...but also corrections, revisions sent backward" could compress without loss. The figurative language (palimpsest, bookmark, margin) coheres without overwriting. No loops that obscure causality, and the final image recharges the pen motif cleanly. Penalty for the contingent-relationships echo: −0.3 within band.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with strong imagery ("luminous harbor," "flowers opening"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "capturing nothing but the memory" / "not trying to preserve the past" restates the same idea; "feeling erased, forgotten" / "isolated world" / "threatened to erase her" recycles the same concept across beats. Template cadence: "She lifted... She raised... She set down..." in close succession. Stock metaphors: "joyful sorrow," "windows lighting up... like flowers opening." Line-level clarity is good, but density suffers from explanatory scaffolding ("the gift he'd given her—not permanence, but presence") that summarizes rather than trusts the image. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8, and one touches the closure vicinity.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong verbs ("traced," "liberated," "gripped"). The opening effectively anchors voice and stakes. However, the piece carries scaffold sentences and paraphrase loops: "Some promises...required you to burn down your own life" immediately follows similar phrasing about "acts of destruction were really acts of love." The metaphor "volcanic tenderness" is strained and undercuts rather than sharpens the emotional beat. Information density is high in backstory but thins during the unopposed cave sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("trembling ribbons of light," "auric lagoon"). Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. Minor scaffold appears: "They had both lost someone—a daughter for her, a sister for him—and both ghosts had loved music" reads as efficient backstory but slightly mechanical in its parallel construction. One near-loop: the drumming pattern is described multiple times without always advancing new pressure. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, and the final image maintains clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally clean with strong information density: "ribbons of poisonous green," "corrugated metal walls humming with electromagnetic interference," and "the rhythm and weight of their steps echoing through the steel canyons" do multiple jobs efficiently. The keyhole revelation ("not a coin at all... a key with no apparent lock mechanism") propels discovery without overwriting. Some mild filter-verb reliance ("he'd recognized," "he'd learned") and a few template transitions ("That's when"), but these don't obscure causality or momentum. The final "aurora painted everything in shades of mystery and promise" tilts slightly purple but remains legible. No loops or scaffold; propulsion is maintained through sensory and plot advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no major loops or scaffold. However, elevated figurative density appears in nearly every paragraph ("bruised light," "spiralingly calm precision," "stillwater tension," "half-spoken secret," "teach darkness the value of stars") without a taught lyric pattern that pays off. Mixed metaphor in "stillwater tension" (stillwater implies calm; tension implies agitation). Stock emotional shorthand: "throat tightened," "meaning crystallized." Overwriting in high-pressure beats (the hour-long collaboration) reduces immediacy. Information density is high, but clarity suffers under figurative stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths avoid template cadence. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (anchoring place, revealing character, advancing theme). Clarity is strong; no ambiguous pronouns or tense slips. However, "forests of second thoughts," "synchronized window displays," and "amplified quiet" appear multiple times in adjacent paragraphs, creating mild paraphrase loops that dull propulsion. The phrase "peculiar hush where past meets prophecy" in the opening and "thickening mist" in the close function as bookends but are not interrogated through action. No filter-verb stacks or therapy-speak in peak beats. Figurative language (blue glass reflection, lighthouse image) is coherent and enhances rather than obscures, but the density of metaphor in the final paragraphs ("forests growing in spaces between certainty and doubt") trends toward overwriting without dramatic pressure to justify it.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings avoid template runs. Information density is high in the scrimshaw discovery beat. However, the piece carries pervasive overwriting: "impossible coastlines," "electric with vulnerability," "blooming like bioluminescence," "desperate hope," "terrible, beautiful liberation" stack figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff. The final paragraph loops thematically: "finally ready to be found" paraphrases "finally embracing their true nature" from two lines prior. The opening line is strong, but the closing image is diluted by summary ("already feeling... already beginning") rather than a single sharp action.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies well: short fragments during peak emotion ("Yes."), longer accumulative sentences during reflection. Information density is high—most lines advance both Marcus's habit and the grief underneath. Minor loop: "mask" for Emma's face appears three times in similar phrasing without added pressure. The final paragraph risks slight overwriting ("gray and fragile and honest," "void, not mandate, just space") but the specificity holds. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Propulsion is steady, though the middle third (whittling description, backstory on the mandate) slows slightly before the emotional turn.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "cloud-shadow poet," "lantern-moth hush," "verse-shadows," "frequencies woven like invisible threads." While atmospheric, this creates sluggishness in key beats; the reader must decode metaphor rather than track action. Paraphrase loop in mid-story: "translation into fixed meaning destroys the very thing that makes it alive" closely echoes the setup. Template cadence: "She placed...she could...she moved...she watched" across multiple paragraphs. Apply −0.6 for density and loop issues in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is vivid and controlled with strong imagery ("brass reed tongue glinting between his fingers like a tiny golden flame," "scorched earth crunched beneath her feet"). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Clarity is maintained throughout. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "Maya understood immediately. This was why the plants had led her here" restates causality without adding pressure (−0.2). One figurative reach: "the silk of dreams" in "texture of consciousness against the silk of dreams" pairs abstraction with abstraction, slightly mudding the contrast. No loops or heavy artifacts; propulsion is steady but could be tighter in the negotiation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong, with vivid concrete detail (prism-song bell ringer, carbide lamp lens, crystalline bone replacements). Information density is high in the opening and middle sections. However, the piece shows moderate overwriting and scaffold: "powerfully gentle" appears twice in near-identical phrasing; "the texture of connection" and "sonic fingerprint of intimacy" are paraphrased across adjacent lines; the final paragraph stacks explanatory clauses ("she'd been seeking… not to study it, but to share it, to propel others toward…") that loop the thematic point. Template cadence in the closure beat ("two strangers on an artificial pilgrimage toward something achingly real. The miner's lamp glowed… and Maren finally understood…") slightly dulls propulsion. No severe artifacts, but accumulation in the final third lowers the band.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with varied rhythm and good sensory grounding (copper dome, brass instruments, blackened fingers). However, several paraphrase loops appear: the opening's "existed outside time" is restated in the penultimate paragraph; "genuinely artificial" recurs three times without reweighting. Metaphoric density in the final third (curtains/windows/shadows, stars/fires/pinpricks) blurs without taught pattern. The closing line's "withering back to bloom" repeats the earlier "teach withering to bloom" almost verbatim.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean and grammatical with purposeful sensory detail ("rain drummed," "cards inked in onyx," "coiled beside her cards like a sleeping snake"). Information density is generally high, though some lines paraphrase: "The grandmother's inheritance wasn't wealth or property. It was a Rosetta Stone..." restates what the prior paragraph showed. A few template cadences appear: "She too had camouflaged... The cryptocurrency crashes had merely made visible..." uses parallel "had" constructions that flatten rhythm. The simile "like scattered diamonds" and "like a sleeping snake" are vivid but lean slightly decorative. No major loops or filter-verb stacks; the prose propels cleanly through most beats.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines advance understanding or emotional charge. The opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Two line-level issues lower the score: elevated diction in peak emotional beats ("distilled emotional and intellectual core," "purity demanded sacrifice") occasionally abstracts rather than grounds, and minor paraphrase loops appear ("the kind her university had banned, the kind that could unmake certainties"). The metaphor "atoms of nostalgia" is conceptually rich but not concretely embodied—it remains a label rather than an image with sensory texture. Clarity and momentum are strong overall, and the final line's callback to "atoms of nostalgia for a future" creates effective closure rhythm. No major scaffold or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or atmosphere. Figurative language clusters in the middle comparison section ("liquid starlight," "saturated with luminous regret," "painted the clouds in shades of amber and ash") without obscuring causality, though the density approaches decorative at the grandmother's-dream paragraph. One paraphrase loop: the shadow-unbound explanation in paragraph 9 restates the prior comparison conclusion. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Minor filter-verb stack ("had become," "had been") in the comparison beat is functional.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in most beats. The opening paragraph efficiently anchors setting, stakes, and backstory. Minimal loops, though "fragile" appears twice in close proximity ("fragile convictions," "something fragile but genuine"). The phrase "Her convictions...had felt solid as bone" followed by "she had been building a bridge between two languages" carries slight figurative density without pattern-teaching. The closure paragraph maintains momentum and clarity. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives in crisis ("There—a gap"), longer accumulative sentences in memory immersion. Information density is high—most lines layer world, memory, and motive. Two minor loops: "The roses would testify. The table would remember. Even the coffee rings held their truth" recycles parallel structure without added pressure; "Some wounds opened themselves" echoes "Some scars wrote themselves" without clear payoff. Figurative language is mostly coherent ("sedimentary layers," "root-knowledge") but "displaced miracle" appears three times without fresh angle. Clarity and propulsion are strong; no filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings shift naturally; information density is generally high (the film strip, letter, vision, archive, and map each advance plot and meaning). However, a few paraphrase loops appear: "She saw their hands almost touching, hesitating, pulling back. She saw goodbye letters written and burned, written and hidden, written and mailed decades too late" recycles "She saw" and "written and" in adjacent clauses, dulling propulsion during the vision sequence. The closure paragraph leans on stock metaphor ("water breaking through a dam") and the final line ("forgotten lyrics finally finding their tune") echoes the earlier timeframe cue, which feels more like planted resonance than emergent image. No major artifacts touch the ending, keeping the score in the 7.0 range.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clarity is generally strong; sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (aurora as "painted breath," stars "singing") enriches without overwhelming. Two line-level artifacts degrade momentum: "across an unwritten calendar" appears twice as ornamental filler, and "shadowed rapture" in paragraph two is not dramatized on the page before being invoked. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs explaining the Keeper's calcification restate "creativity crystallized" without added pressure. Filter verbs ("began to see," "felt warm") cluster in the middle third, dulling immediacy. The final image—tracing an imperfect star—has clean propulsion, but the penultimate paragraph ("she understood finally why") summarizes rather than trusts the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance world, character, or atmosphere. Minor loop: "Tomorrow she would deliver more seeds to another impossible place. Tomorrow the unlit corners would spark again" feels like paraphrase churn (−0.2). The figurative language is controlled and legible, though "fractured lullaby" and "wave functions like fingers through tall grass" cluster heavily in the charm sequence without obscuring clarity. No scaffolding, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity is adequate; no pronoun confusion. However, pervasive scaffold and exposition weaken momentum: "This was how it always happened" / "He had started cataloging these sounds weeks ago" / "He'd spent his previous life in the ivory towers" are all backstory summaries that dilate the present. Paraphrase loop: "the ability to think beyond the prison of conscious logic" restates the "wild frontier of the mind" without added pressure. Metaphor density is high but functional. Line-level propulsion sags under reflective weight; the text often tells what has been shown.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; opening simile ("like polished driftwood") and closing momentum are strong. Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every paragraph carries a metaphor or simile—but most are coherent and voice-consistent. Minor template cadence in the confession paragraph: "about the job... about the man... about the art" is a three-part list that reads slightly mechanical. "Gently persistent as waves reshaping shore stones" and "shoreline lullaby, rhythmic and sure" approach stock oceanic phrasing. No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks. Information density is solid; minimal scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high ("The surgeons promised full recovery, but she needed to understand what that safety had cost"). Figurative language is controlled and voice-specific ("turrets like frozen fingers," "steam rising like small prayers"). Template-cadence penalty: the final paragraph opens three consecutive sentences with similar structure ("The cost of safety…" / "The grace was…" / "She played until…"), creating a summary-conclusion feel that slightly flattens momentum. One paraphrase loop: "frostbitten hope" appears in both the opening move and the penultimate paragraph with near-identical framing. Clarity and propulsion otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. However, several stretches lean into decorative phrasing without advancing pressure: "neither boasting of his power nor diminishing his sacred charge" is scaffold; "the fabric of deception begin to sunder" and "tore like wet parchment" form a synonym pair. The figurative language is vivid but occasionally stacks without escalating stakes. Momentum holds, but tightening would lift clarity and propulsion in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings differ. Information density is high: most lines do plot, character, or thematic work. The phrase "periodically eternal" is evocative but borders on oxymoron without grounding—it appears once and is not dramatized as a constraint. Minor scaffold: "She began to type her report, documenting the delayed revelation" summarizes rather than showing her fingers on keys or a first sentence. No loops or filter-verb stacks. The closure paragraph maintains momentum and anchors the final image cleanly. Figurative language is controlled and does not muddle peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language ("bleeding away," "thunderous serenity") mostly coheres. Minor loop: "something dormant inside her" and "something both ancient and revolutionary" restate the same concept without added pressure. One template stem: "She raised the opera glasses..." recurs three times with similar phrasing. Information density is solid, and no pronoun confusion. The loops are contained to non-closure beats, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high ("the sulfurous waters during her morning meditation, did she notice the strange script winding along its length"). Minor loops: "something old, something sealed, something waiting" is purposeful parallelism, but the plants' overlapping voices and crescendo lack a distinct payoff image. The final paragraph stacks declarative certainties without syntactic variety: "already sensing… The kite's tail fluttered… Tradition had evolved… Naja walked…" creates a steady drumbeat rather than modulating closure rhythm. One paraphrase slip: "neither wholly plant nor wholly human" and "not through domination but through integration" use similar balanced negation without added pressure. No severe artifacts, but closure propulsion softens.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with strong imagery: "wearing hope like jewelry," "the sky had opened with fire," "the ocean below sang its endless song." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. Minor scaffold appears in paired constructions: "She would never stop missing them. The photograph would remain crumpled. Some mornings..." creates a template cadence. The phrase "the pearl of stillness was this" explicitly defines the metaphor rather than trusting the image. No loops or major artifacts, but the explanatory tendency in key beats prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally controlled with purposeful rhythm and vivid imagery ("hinges splintered like driftwood," "books pressed closer... geometry that shouldn't exist"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or pressure. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the walls contracting is stated three separate times in near-synonym variants ("pressed closer," "contract further," "compressed further, now barely ten feet across"), and "fragmented reality" is restated as "reality itself had cracked," "fragmentation was the human condition," and "fragmented reality showed its honest face." Figurative density in the climax passage (luminescent, spiral tightening, mandala, blazed, gentle impossible flame) approaches overwriting without a taught pattern to justify the accumulation. These loops and density clusters appear in non-closure beats, so the −0.8 non-closure accumulation cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance character, action, or atmosphere without padding. "The serene anger that had sustained him through two decades of tracking settled deeper into his bones" economically conveys motivation and emotional state. One minor template cadence in the middle section ("He found... She didn't... Her dark skin...") but not pervasive. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language ("wind and sun conspired to erase it," "touching eternity") is purposeful and imagistic without overwriting. Spatial choreography is clear; no impossible positions. Final line recharges prior motifs (disappearing, wind-carved, tracking) without stating theme. Zero scaffolding or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Strong opening ("The echoing library under snow held its breath") and closing images anchor voice and stakes. However, several prose artifacts weaken the peak beats: "bravely conflicted" is label-speak rather than dramatized contradiction; "the decision crystallized within the blink that follows surprise" is ornate phrasing that doesn't match the extended reflection that actually occurs; "dangerous liaison" and "contraband" appear repeatedly as thematic tokens rather than varied, specific language. Minor paraphrase loop: "the kind of information that toppled governments" closely echoes "heretical science, suppressed histories" without added pressure. Apply −0.6 for template metaphors and label-speak in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., the ballast scraps anchor setting, method, and theme). Rhythm varies; sentence openings and lengths modulate with pressure. Minor loop: "kept weapons ready even in the only place that might be called home" and "in the only place that might be called home" repeat the anchor phrase; the second iteration adds no new pressure. "Tranquil blaze" is a purposeful oxymoron but edges toward strained diction. No catastrophic artifacts, but the loop and one or two elevated phrases ("engraved quiet") slightly dull momentum in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are distinct. High information density: nearly every line advances Mara's hunt, the garden's behavior, or the constellations' drift. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor overwriting in the penultimate paragraph: "a gift and a memory and a promise all at once" stacks abstractions where a single concrete image would sharpen. The figurative language (constellations as somnambulists, feral lullaby) is coherent and voice-integrated. Zero artifact debt in closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and several images land well ("ink the color of midnight between stars," "echoing walls, which caught her words and threw them back like questioning companions"). Sentence openings vary. Information density is generally high. Three frictions: (1) Minor paraphrase loop: "The observatory echoed with the scratch of nib on paper" closely restates "her strokes as precise as plotting stellar coordinates" without added pressure. (2) Stock metaphor: "a moon of doubt refusing to settle" is generic astronomy imagery. (3) Figurative density in the opening runs high (starlight-whispers-conversations, rosewood talisman, orbit of regret, creature waking) without clear pattern payoff, verging on ornamental. The final paragraph's "proper ellipse—not circular and endless, but spiral and ascending" over-explains the metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Sentence rhythm varies and propels without sluggishness. Minor figurative overreach appears: "constellation tattooist" and "meteor hush" feel decorative rather than earned by prior imagery. The phrase "time folded in on itself, when Thursday became Tuesday" is vivid but not causally integrated into Vera's on-page choices. One paraphrase loop: "She'd heard the dissonance in his cry and chosen her research over his life" restates the prior paragraph's content without added pressure (−0.2). No severe loops or scaffold, but the accumulation of prompt-driven phrases ("haunted firmware," "meteor hush") slightly reduces organic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentence openings diversify. "She'd unlearned her birth name three weeks ago along with her address, her mother's face, and the taste of honey" demonstrates strong specificity and information density. However, several minor artifacts accumulate: "the mist and the forgetting" pairs abstract with concrete awkwardly; "an emergent hush fell over them—not the hush of silence, but of collective attention" is a paraphrase loop that restates rather than advances; "whimsical marks" in a high-pressure beat feels register-mismatched. Propulsion remains strong overall, but these slips prevent higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice effectively. However, multiple passages veer into overwriting: "warm coldness," "sky fractured like broken glass," "tessera-studded testament" stack figurative density without clear payoff. The phrase "watched civilizations rise and fall" is stock. Paraphrase loops appear: the regime's binding of consciousness is explained twice in adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence in the naming sequence ("Mikhail ibn Rashid... Yara of the Eastern Gardens") reads more like a list than dramatized action. Clarity is generally maintained but momentum dips during the reflection-heavy middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("aurora patterns," "crystalline chimes," "waves of golden light, warm as summer honey"). However, several beats rely on synonym churn and conceptual redundancy: "fractured/shattered/unraveling," "echoes/recursion/rippled," "faded/dissolved/woven" recur without added pressure. The phrase "colors she had no names for, hues that existed only in the spaces between moments" exemplifies overwriting in a high-pressure beat. The closure image carries weight, but scaffolding ("she danced to lure possibility," "she understood then what she had to do") flattens momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence openings and purposeful rhythm. Two local artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loop in paragraph four ("rewired something fundamental in how her neurons fired" immediately following "The shock had changed her") and a cluster of filter verbs in the final third ("could perceive," "could teach," "could save") that slightly dull immediacy during high-pressure moments. The closing line's stacked modifiers ("fractally precise, yet warm with possibility") blur concrete sense. Information density is strong overall; no major scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose features vivid imagery ("luminescent jellyfish," "ocean carved through limestone") but repeatedly loops conceptual phrasing: "transitional objects" appears three times with near-identical framing, and "voice of the unknown" recurs as a mantra. The final third stacks summative declarations ("she became what she'd sought," "factually mystical proof") rather than showing the change through action. Minor filter-verb clusters ("she felt," "she realized") in the climax dull immediacy. Sentence variety is present but rhythm flattens during the communion beat where propulsion is most needed.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or theme. Minor scaffold: "She began to study the buttons with new urgency" tells rather than showing the study; the next beat jumps to Desta's charts without dramatizing Mara's work. The phrase "shared wisdom written in fragments" is abstract where a concrete image would sharpen. No loops or template cadence; figurative language (ribbon echo, amber light) remains coherent and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clear with purposeful rhythm, but several phrases loop or lean on stock constructions: "silver hush" recurs three times without evolving meaning; "the kind of dead drop only Sarah would devise, prudently daring enough" stacks modifiers; "careful reserve" and "careful steps" echo within proximity. The opening and closing gestures (mist, zephyr, Marcus descending) create symmetry, but "unused courage had been waiting all along in the space between fear and action, between winter's end and spring's brave beginning" stacks abstractions at a peak beat. High information density in the snow-code reveal, but scaffolding persists ("he'd assumed she meant," "he realized").

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with longer atmospheric passages ("fog-bound river crossing," "skeletal trees") alternating with short declaratives at key beats ("All of it is true"). Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Clarity is strong; no ambiguous referents. Minor deductions: "percolate through forced stillness" and "percolate through silence" repeat the stem unnecessarily; "working nervously at its clasp" is functional but borderline generic. The metaphor "stars scattered like punctuation marks" is fresh and apt. No loops or scaffold; grammar is clean. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final image ("clicked to his horses and turned back toward the water") completes the ritual frame without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is lyric and controlled with vivid imagery ("chimney smoke... flattened against the burnt orange sky," "dust motes hung suspended mid-fall"), but several lines loop conceptually: the thrum is described three times in near-identical terms, and "kindness" is asserted repeatedly without escalating embodiment. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "Through it, she could see... Through it, she could also see..." The final paragraph over-explains the thematic payload ("Everyone who understands carries it forward") where the image alone would suffice. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Baseline deduction −0.6 for loops and conceptual redundancy across adjacent beats.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the mirror-system logic. Minor scaffold appears: "She was certain" recurs twice in closure paragraph, creating a small loop that dulls the final image's charge. One paraphrase loop: "protected vulnerability" and "vulnerability could exist within care" restate the same concept. Figurative language (harbor's "ancient conversation," "papery lightness of ending") is purposeful and coherent. No grammar, tense, or pronoun issues. Propulsion slows slightly in the middle beats (adjusting mirrors, watering basil) but recovers by the discovery of the neighbor's seedlings.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful in most passages. However, paraphrase loops appear: "coexist with herself" / "coexistence" recurs across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure; "brittle," "fractured," "scattered" cycle near-synonyms for fragmentation. Template cadence in exposition: "She had awakened... The reincarnation memory had come... Now, in this floating sanctuary..." reads as scaffold sequencing. The sundial reprise is effective, but minor redundancies and elevated diction ("liminal," "verdigris-streaked," "contemporaneous") in non-stress beats prevent entry into higher bands. No artifacts touch the closure image directly, so penalties remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines advance image and meaning. Opening line establishes voice and spatial anchor effectively. Two minor artifacts: "inevitably whimsical" appears twice as authorial stamp without dramatic payoff, and the final sentence stacks three independent clauses that slightly diffuse closure focus. Figurative language (temple as "cupped palm holding silence," chamber as "flower's throat") remains coherent and embodied. No loops or scaffold; clarity and propulsion sustain throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.0)
    Information density is high and most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. Minor loop detected: "the tricksters were getting closer" in paragraph one is echoed by "the tricksters converging on the radio tower" in paragraph six without added pressure between. Template cadence appears in paragraph three with repeated "The [group] blamed [target]" structure across three consecutive sentences, triggering the −0.4 deduction for template runs. No mixed metaphors or register drift; sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with scene pressure. The final image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift, and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. No paraphrase loops or template stems detected. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor figurative clustering: "dust motes danced," "clawed at her throat," "teeth," "lighthouse warns of rocks" in close proximity, though each stays legible. The phrase "pointing not north but down, always down, to where truth lay buried beneath convenient lies" stacks modifiers at closure without muddling the image. Zero loops, strong propulsion, clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is generally coherent ("mist clung to the limestone walls like memory itself"). However, several phrases edge toward overwriting: "empathy lanced through sadness like light through glass" stacks metaphors in one beat, and "the shadowed quarry of her mind, where faces disappeared into mist" repeats the quarry/mist pairing without fresh pressure. A minor paraphrase loop appears in paragraph two: "she painted what she felt, translating the subtle architecture of emotion into lines and shadows" restates the paradox already established in "Where others painted what they saw, she painted what she felt." The closure paragraph is clean, but the accumulation of decorative metaphor in high-pressure beats (the portrait's creation, the final insight) dulls immediacy slightly. Propulsion is steady, though the summarized interviews and painting process sacrifice some density.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several beats suffer from expository summary where scene pressure would land harder: "Everyone thinks he abandoned his family" and the stanza-description paragraph read like backstory dumps rather than discoveries under stress. The phrase "spongey dread" appears once without embodiment in action or perception. Minor template cadence in the dialogue tags: "Mira said," "Dr. Kao observed," "Mira's voice carried." No loops or metaphor muddles in peak beats, and the closing line ("strange, singing cold") recharges the atmospheric motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops dull momentum: "The hitchhiker had been there one moment...and then gone the next" restates vanishing twice in the opening; "pixelated amnesty" is explained by the hitchhiker, then recounted by Mara, then summarized again in narration. Figurative language stacks without causal work: "crystalline," "luminous disbelief," "photons dancing," "quantum vibration" appear in a single climactic paragraph, blurring the concrete image. The phrase "a secret mapped by scaffold wrap flutters" arrives fully formed in Mara's mind, reading as prompt-insertion rather than organic thought. Scaffold phrasing ("she understood," "she realized," "without thinking") pads transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies well ("The abandoned circus train had been Marco's home for three years" vs. the staccato "Clean money, clean life"), and information density is high in the backstory compression. Figurative language (bills as "gallery art," sensors as "birdhouses," "dusky harmony") mostly works. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "collection of his father's collection had become something else—a map" restates the prior metaphor without added pressure, and "polished calm" / "perceptively calm" cycle as synonym churn across four mentions. The "ancient and knotted…loosen" closure line borders on stock metaphor but stays within voice.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in symbol-matching beats. Two paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "understanding dawned between them like sunrise" immediately after "The inscriptions weren't hiding knowledge—they were teaching a method" restates the realization; the final paragraph's summary ("how an ancient people had transformed...") recaps theme already enacted. Template cadence appears in the closing: "how isolation breaks what community mends, how the universe itself demonstrates..." Figurative language is controlled except for "understanding dawned between them like sunrise" (stock metaphor). No filter-verb stacks or major opacity, but theループ artifacts and thematic restatement dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistic: "apple trees grew in impossible spirals," "A frozen confession, caught between speaking and silence," "each note a hammer striking the frozen moment." Sentence variety supports momentum and no paraphrase loops appear. However, two template-cadence runs weaken peaks: the second paragraph's "The magician's apprentice had attempted... seeking to discover... The spell had failed..." stacks passive-voice exposition, and "She planted her staff and began to sing... The trees shuddered... As she sang, she noticed" mechanically sequences actions. "Warlike serenity" recurs three times (opening, midpoint, close) without evolution, bordering on ornamental repetition. Information density is high and clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and several images are vivid ("bruised purples," "fertile soil"), but metaphoric density crowds the final beat without clear causal linkage—"cobalt glade pulsed," "grass spiraled tighter," "shared dream, rising" stack symbolic gestures. Minor paraphrase loop: "time to prepare, time to understand, time to find" recycles structure without added detail. No severe template cadence, but "anxious elation" is named twice without embodiment. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, others ("the emotion felt wrong and right simultaneously") restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("joy sits wrong...like I swallowed wasps," "understanding dawn across his face like a bruise") but clusters heavily in nearly every sentence, risking overwriting in a piece this short. Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. Minor loop: "fiercely gentle" appears twice (dialogue tag and closing line) without significant reweighting. The final paragraph—"Around them, the trees whispered..."—stalls momentum with exposition that tells the thematic point ("The orchard understood what humans always forgot") rather than letting the image stand. Sentence openings vary well, and no serious grammatical or tense inconsistencies appear. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and sentences do double duty (grille cloth swaying = loss + roadie identity). Information density is high. Opening and closing images frame cleanly. Weaknesses: "holy silence" is elevated diction that clashes with roadie idiom; "insulating emotionally with facts" is abstract therapy-speak in narration; "valley-deep with concern" mixes vehicle (valley = spatial depth, not vocal quality). Paraphrase-loop candidate: "After the applause dies, after everyone goes home" restates "roar that came after the applause, when crowds dispersed." These artifacts don't obscure closure but accumulate to −0.6 to −0.8 range within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and momentum are generally sound; sentences advance story and image. However, several loops and scaffold phrases appear: "the same process as," "transformation of state," "changed state," and "transition/transform/transformation" recur without added nuance. Paragraph opening "The" appears in four consecutive paragraphs mid-story, creating template cadence. Figurative language (luminous vines, colors with no names, taste of lightning) is evocative but occasionally elevated beyond Emilia's immediate urgency ("electromagnetic, metallic and bright"). No major opacity at closure, but the accumulated artifact density (paraphrase loops, thematic echo in "The physics of transition were simple after all") and light register drift prevent entry to the 8+ band. Baseline deduction −0.6 for loops/scaffold, plus minor figurative density in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual breath. Information density is high in the opening (atrium, gears, moon, seawater channels). Minor scaffold appears: "The titan-gear library was her answer" tells rather than shows the answer through action, and "something essential leaked away: the capacity for wonder" summarizes the world's change in abstract terms. The final image ("ancient, ever-new pattern through the unchanging air") recharges prior material cleanly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity and propulsion are sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with longer contemplative structures giving way to shorter declarations at key moments ("He understood his new purpose"). Information density is high—most lines advance discovery or understanding. However, some template cadence appears in the middle section: "He would catalog...He would find...And if they didn't, he would ensure." The phrase "latent radiance" recurs three times, appropriate for the core concept but verging on echo. "Hearts beating in proximity" and "hearts and" repetition in the confession creates minor synonym drift. The closing image "radiance no longer latent, but alive" effectively recharges the opening's latent quality.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop conceptually: "raw with feeling" / "raw and solace-seeking attention," "precision could anchor her" / "daringly methodical," "claimed / claiming dead spaces." The final paragraph stacks abstract constructions ("moving timelessly forward while somehow remaining itself, teaching her what she'd come to learn") that summarize rather than propel. The accordion's "repairs upon repairs testament to stubborn preservation" and "elicits a concrete emotional aftereffect" carry elevated diction that doesn't fully match the established voice under pressure. Figurative language (river as mirror, ivy as resurrection) remains coherent but is present in most reflective beats without pattern-teaching or decisive payoff at closure, triggering mild overwriting concern.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high in the navigation beats (third shelf, fifth manifestation, seventh propagation delay). However, several phrases loop or restate without adding pressure: "glowing library in mist" and "pulsed with soft luminescence"; "cautious exuberance" is both named and explained in the same breath. The phrase "architecture of their solitude" in the penultimate paragraph elevates register slightly beyond the established voice. No major artifacts touch closure, but the accumulation of near-synonyms and slight overwriting in non-closure beats prevents entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well and figurative language (ice crystal singing, glaciers weeping, truth as seeds) coheres without muddle. Information density is high in the coffee-reading and final-choice beats. However, several paraphrase loops dull momentum: "before the promise she'd made to the monks lost its glow, before their faith in justice turned to ash" restates the same deadline; "the violin dissolving at dawn, taking with it the only proof" is echoed by "The violin would melt at dawn" five paragraphs later. The phrase "perforated destiny" appears three times with slight variation but no added pressure. Template cadence in plant interiority (*careful, careful* / *Propagate the truth* / *We persist*) flattens their voices into a collective rather than distinct consciousnesses. These artifacts cluster but don't touch the closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives ("She always did. It was why...") accelerate closure while longer descriptive sentences ("The walls were carved ice, softened by steam vents...") establish the grotto early. Information density is high: most sentences layer sensory detail with ritual function or thematic charge. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor scaffold appears in a few lines: "Lyra was both beautician and mortician, twin vocations that had merged in her hands until she could no longer separate them" restates the merger twice; "Tonight's subject was different. The girl on the preparation table couldn't have been more than sixteen" could compress. Stock phrase "hollow as they'd left" and "grain of rice" lean generic. These small slips don't obscure cause/effect or dull closure, so cumulative deduction remains modest. Figurative language ("green curtains rippling," "tiny star") is controlled and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and strong imagery ("silver waterfall," "blade wrapped in silk," "eternal dance"). Information density is high: most lines advance character, setting, or theme. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor issues: "the unforgivable—abandoned Keiko" is a tell-then-show stutter (the abandonment is immediately explained, dulling the label), and "both and neither" + "everyone you've ever loved" in the closing sequence stack abstractions where a single concrete image would sharpen. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "clouds passing" and "vineyard hush" work, though "vineyard hush" as a metaphor for prayer-breath is slightly strained.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language (refraction, chimes, cloak) serves the accumulative design. However, several paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs restating Mara's loss of certainty without added pressure, and the Vincent case summary recurs with synonym variation. Template cadence in the keeper's exposition ("My father installed these. Taught me...") flattens momentum. The phrase "sincerely insincere greeting" feels like a forced element insertion rather than organic description. Closure beats remain clear, but mid-story scaffold ("Until Vincent" as a one-line paragraph) and repetitive sentence stems lower density.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is controlled with vivid figurative density and varied syntax. Sentence rhythm modulates appropriately. However, multiple instances of paraphrase loops appear: "Neither crest nor trough but absence itself" restates the prior clause; "precise intersection of readiness and knowledge" / "precise moment when revelation would root" recycles the precision-frame without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in the researcher's reflections ("I couldn't understand… I see that…"). Metaphor vehicles occasionally stack without integration, creating textural opacity rather than propulsion. Line-level clarity holds, but momentum sags under figurative weight in non-closure beats, triggering −0.4 for paraphrase and −0.3 for template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, but several figurative constructions blur precision: "sound itself had become a physical thing, layered like sediment" mixes metaphor vehicles (sound-as-matter, sediment-as-time). "A pulse left wandering" recurs as a poetic phrase without mechanical grounding until the ending. Minor filter-verb stacking ("began to appraise," "allowed it to guide") in the middle beats slightly dulls immediacy. No loops or scaffolding; clarity remains strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentences vary in structure and rhythm supports the slow, meditative climb. Information density is high in the opening (spire, Maren's status, the keystone's history). Minor issues: "wondering why she bothered when spell-generators could teleport anyone anywhere instantaneously" is a scaffold explaining her motivation rather than showing it through a concrete choice in the moment. "The point was the doing, the being, the sacred simplicity of human effort" summarizes rather than trusts the prior action to convey it. Paraphrase loop: "The mist didn't form as it should have. Instead, the lingering luminance..." and then "The mist finally came, but not from her spell" restate the mist's behavior across paragraphs. Template cadence: several paragraphs open with "The [noun]" ("The spire," "The point," "The mist," "The automated systems"), creating a subtle drumbeat. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems, −0.3 for scaffold summary.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and momentum is generally strong through action beats. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "converted into a private library before it sank" is immediately restated in the next sentence ("ship had gone down...mast still visible...hull settled"), and the closing paragraph recycles "luminous vow" three times across four paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in backstory: "He'd been a sound engineer who went deaf...spending his remaining decades obsessing..." follows a familiar biographical summary pattern. Stock metaphors ("cathedral," "delayed stars") don't obscure sense but lack freshness. Overall density is good, but these artifacts prevent entry to high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear and propulsive, with good information density and purposeful rhythm. The opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, runs of identical sentence stems appear in the vision sequence ("She saw herself yesterday... She saw Kael tomorrow... She saw last week"), creating template cadence in a high-pressure beat (−0.4). No paraphrase loops or metaphor muddle; figurative language remains legible and sparse.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Medieval cartographers had drawn them to give names to nameless fears..." delivers world detail, thematic setup, and Mira's projection simultaneously). No loops or template cadence. Two minor friction points: "she understood that impulse now" is a small tell after effective showing, and "the echo of his sacrifice lived in these walls" borders on abstraction though it's immediately grounded by the recordings detail. Figurative language (sea monsters, jewel of grief, scattered light) is dense but coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density (most sentences advance character, world, or action). Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. A few lines edge toward overwriting ("frozen river of light," "rhythm of the world relearning balance") without harming clarity. Figurative language is controlled and doesn't muddle peak beats. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and image effectively. Grammar and sequencing are clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically varied with high information density in most beats. Opening line ("The wind chime had fallen silent three hours before dawn") anchors voice and stakes; final image ("meaning waits, patient and preserved") recharges the motif. Minor scaffold appears: "He stood... and watched" followed by "Marcus descended" and "He picked it up" clusters filter verbs and generic action stems in the opening third. "The photographs led him" is repeated structurally. No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks, and figurative language ("town materialize like a photograph in developing fluid") is apt and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies well; sentence openings and lengths create visual texture. Information density is high in the opening (waterfall, hair, orchard's temporal paradox compressed efficiently). Minor overwriting in the starling passage: "Their patterns revealing the final sequence, the last step she hadn't been able to deduce through reason alone" tells what the dramatized watching already shows. The phrase "electric sense of standing at the threshold of truth" is generic. Two small loops: "ancient freshness" appears twice (orchard hums with it, then it's a contradiction), and "logic and intuition" / "reason and instinct" cycle. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clean with strong propulsion. Information density is high: "parachute buckle against her palm—a talisman from her first descent, when everything had gone wrong" does three jobs efficiently. Minor loop: "the watcher's burden" appears twice in near-identical construction without added pressure. Template stem: "She'd been stationed... she'd been attentively inventive... she'd held it" runs a "she'd been/held" pattern across key beats. No figurative muddle; rhythm varies appropriately. Closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short "No" followed by longer exposition, then clipped dialogue exchanges); information density is high (most lines do two jobs: world-build and advance conflict). Minor deductions: "pristine and wrinkled" is near-contradictory without payoff; "vivify" recurs as lexical anchor but edges into thesaurus-itis when the simpler "make whole" would serve. The opening "tethered to nothing, anchored by meditation alone" is a strong hook. One paraphrase loop: "I need her. Not for love. For the opposite" is re-explained two beats later with "my emptiness can hold space." No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; momentum is clean through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short fragments at emotional peaks, longer accumulations during reflection), and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. The piece avoids major loops, though "the tunnel held/carried/took" structure repeats across multiple paragraphs in similar syntax. Two figurative choices feel strained: "dust became a galaxy" and "sound became something solid" blur into abstraction under pressure. The hourglass metaphor ("After the final grain slips through") in the penultimate paragraph reads as late-arriving scaffold that could be cut without loss. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats. The opening establishes voice and stakes cleanly. However, several lines carry figurative density without full coherence: "dimensional longing for coordinates her body remembered but her mind had never known" stacks abstraction; "interiorizing exteriors" is more label than image. Minor paraphrase loop: "The mist curled… Maris crouched… She had learned to wait" cycles through parallel setup without immediate pressure. No major loops or scaffold, but the metaphor load in the middle third occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high in ritual beats; sentences advance character and atmosphere together. However, template cadence appears in reflective passages: "The break wasn't random... like a predetermined fate, like the destiny her father had mapped" stacks similar constructions. "Through successive approximation" appears twice as phrase-marker without varied integration. Some scaffold remains: "She'd been trying for years to recreate her father's successes, to validate his failed legacy through her own achievements" restates the prior setup. The metaphor "frost patterns on a corpse" for "beautiful yet useless" works vividly, but the closing "hopelessness was just another ingredient" reads stock. No loops at closure; propulsion remains clear through the transformation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; imagery is vivid and concise ("iron prayers," "throat of darkness," "elemental vocabulary"). Information density is high with minimal scaffolding. However, several lines risk overwriting: "cosmic geometries that predated the star's explosion" and "mathematical poetry that had assembled hydrogen into helium" stack elevated diction in adjacent beats without clear pattern-teaching. The phrase "practicing her fantasy practicality" late in the piece reads as scaffold or meta-commentary rather than earned lexicon. No major loops, but figurative density in the closure sequence approaches threshold without crossing into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Clarity and momentum are strong—no loops, synonym churn, or scaffold detected. Information density is solid: lines often advance both atmosphere and plot (e.g., "stars at impossible angles," "clocks ran sideways"). Minor overwriting in the grotto climax ("spiral together, merging via the interconnected patterns") leans slightly abstract, and "resiliently positive energy" is tell-heavy. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Figurative language (hourglass as focus, starlight as map) is coherent and purposeful. Strong execution with no artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong opening and closing images. However, several patterns reduce density: "existed in the space between" is stock phrasing, "weaving patterns through their sleeping minds to restructure painful memories" is near-summary, and "the vibration of human consciousness making itself tangible" drifts into abstraction. Template cadence appears in the memory-eruption sequence: "Her sister's face... Her father's hands... Her first love's goodbye..." The final third carries slight overwriting—"the geometric proof that connection thrives not despite change, but because of it" states theme rather than letting the image hold it. Paraphrase loop: "realistically imaginary" concept is restated as "rational enchantment" without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high—"She traced the first constellation with her finger, following its edge geometry through the deep water" integrates action, metaphor, and stakes efficiently. The opening grounds voice and setting quickly; the final image recharges the chain link motif. Figurative language ("geological processes compressed into seconds," "water-memories") is vivid and voice-consistent. Two scaffold patterns reduce momentum: the phrase "unfolded horizons" appears three times without syntactic transformation, and the construction "She had [past action]" recurs across paragraphs ("She had come," "She had abandoned") in a way that stalls present pressure. No loops obscure causality, but these repetitions dull line-level propulsion in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing lines anchor voice and image effectively. Information density is high: the hearing aid, photograph, and frequency map all do multiple jobs. No loops or paraphrase cycles appear. However, minor register drift occurs: "persistently curious nature" and "when hearts connected across distance or time" read slightly elevated for the urgent present moment. The phrase "their resemblance unmistakable in the curve of their smiles" is efficient but edges toward generic descriptor. The final paragraph's "real darkness had finally fallen" restates the time anchor unnecessarily. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful overall, but the density of metaphor in the opening paragraph (bruised hour, spilled ink, skeletal ferns, spiderweb shadows) slightly exceeds the scene's present pressure without teaching a pattern that pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is largely clean with strong imagery ("facility exhaled saltwater," "golden fleck...pulsed faintly") and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high in the middle third. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "invisible things" recurs across adjacent lines without added nuance; "phase transition" and "threshold" are synonym-churned in close proximity. The opening's "compression in her chest" reappears as "claustrophobia clawed at her throat" without fresh embodiment. Template cadence emerges in the middle: "She had seen...," "She traced...," "She checked...," "She moved..." across consecutive beats. These minor artifacts dull momentum but do not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is mostly clean with strong rhythm and clarity. Information density is high; beats do multiple jobs (e.g., "one-two-three" as heartbeat, survival proof, and obsessive marker). However, minor scaffold appears: "The digital ghost had spoken, not through supernatural means, but through the patience of pattern" over-explains what the prior scene already dramatized. The phrase "midnight solace" appears in the final paragraph as thematic summary rather than earned image. Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed moment: "fetching wisdom" and "emerging data" feel slightly ornamental rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but mostly coherent (diamond's flaw as "frozen scream" and "tunnel of echoes"). Sentence openings vary. One minor loop: "The diamond was her last hope" / "The diamond grew hot" / "She set the diamond"—functional anchor but template-adjacent. Information density is strong; lines multi-task (e.g., copper veins mark lineage and warm with use). No major clarity issues. Propulsion slows slightly during the description of Velathi grammar patterns, but recovers at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and most sentences advance character or atmosphere. "Winter killed everything it touched. Down here, life persisted..." creates effective contrast. However, paraphrase loops appear: "bitterness...transformed her into this" followed by "bitterness began to metamorphose" restates within two paragraphs. "Gravitationally playful" recurs without added pressure. Template stem "She thought of" opens two adjacent late-stage sentences. No muddy metaphors; proofreading is clean. Information density is strong in the phone-call beat but thins in the Voss reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and most lines advance story or atmosphere. Strong specific images: "translucent locust shell," "liquid gold that fell to the earth." However, the piece carries overwriting in high-pressure beats: "the eternal space between the chrysalis and the wing" stacks metaphor at closure without grounding it in concrete action, and "tarnished wonder of a world remembering how to change" in the penultimate paragraph layers abstraction when momentum needs propulsion. Template cadence appears in the orchard sequence: "The orchard was dying. Where apple trees had once bloomed... now only gray branches creaked." The phrase "living statues" recurs without functional variation. Mixed metaphor: statues "weep... liquid gold" that "sank into the dying roots"—the vehicle (weeping) and the substance (molten metal) clash in physical logic. Apply −0.7 for figurative density and coherence issues in peak beats, plus −0.3 for template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, but several paraphrase loops appear: "linking absences" recurs three times without added pressure, and "brittle hush" bookends the piece without functional evolution. Template cadence is visible in repeated "She'd been asked… she'd learned… she'd discovered" constructions in the opening third. Figurative density is high in reflective passages ("storms in bottles," "trapped lightning seeking release") without always advancing scene momentum. The final two paragraphs summarize Maren's ongoing work rather than anchoring in a concrete image, which dulls propulsion at closure. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she heard," "she thought," "she recognized") cluster in mid-beats but do not reach the threshold for harsher penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with sensory specificity ("spirals that caught light like water," "patterns of light that danced across the car's interior"). However, several passages loop thematically without advancing pressure: "silence here meant something different than emptiness" is restated multiple times, and the final paragraph recaps insights already shown. Filter verbs ("felt its vibration," "felt immediately") cluster in places but remain voice-motivated. Stock metaphors appear ("surrounded him like grace," "gleamed with reflected light") without fresh inflection. Opening and closing lines are serviceable but the closing leans on summary rather than a charged image. Information density is uneven; transit and reflection occupy more space than causal action.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies, figurative language is dense but coherent (curves, wells, membrane, hyperbolic planes), and information density is high. Minor paraphrase loop: "She understood. She was searching too" restates without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in opening: "They came... She watched... She understood..." uses similar stems across three beats (−0.4). No filter-verb stacks or clarity breaks. Sentence openings vary after the setup. Metaphors are consistent (geometry as emotional architecture). Proofreading is clean. The elevated diction (villanelles, iambic pentameter, Lobachevsky) matches POV but remains uniform across stress levels, dulling immediacy slightly. Overall propulsion is strong; the walk sequence accelerates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high in the cipher-discovery and photography-replication passages. The opening paragraph establishes voice and stakes efficiently. However, several lines carry scaffold: "She understood now that Theo had used the colors as a key" over-explains what the next sentence will show, and "The whispering archipelago kept its secrets, but it also offered invitations" is a thematic summary rather than scene work. The phrase "luminous absence" recurs purposefully but borders on refrain without enough variation. "Dreams run when you stop believing. To vitalize them, you must meet them in the between-places" (Theo's message) introduces thesis-speak that the prose then paraphrases in the closing paragraphs. No major loops or filter-verb stacks, and the figurative language (watercolors bleeding, shimmer, translucent fog) remains coherent and supports the light-painting conceit without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and several images land (cobblestones "gleamed like dark water," the star's pulse matching the streets). However, figurative language clusters densely: "shadow of the old fountain," "swallowed light," "dark water," "enveloped secrets," "hush of cosmic possibility" within the opening third—elevated register without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loop: "Neither old nor young" / "deliberately forgettable" restates the same idea. Template cadence in the sister's description: "Not died—vanished… Not the hair—the ribbon." Propulsion is intermittent; the locksmith's exposition stalls momentum mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. Opening line establishes voice and stakes effectively. However, several phrases carry minor padding: "her chronically curious nature, the same relentless questioning that had driven her to document dying traditions across six continents" stacks near-synonyms; "sharp-sweet" and "soil-stained and sure" echo template alliteration patterns. The exposition block about the dying woman and astronomical records, while necessary, slightly dulls momentum mid-story. No loops touch closure, keeping the core clean.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Two pattern issues: "combative tenderness" is named three times without fresh embodiment after the first instance, risking label-loop; the final paragraph stacks abstract theme statements ("that exile can reverse... that even trapped shadows hold light... that even frozen moments can teach movement... that brokenness has architecture... that what seems shattered can become a lens") in paraphrase-loop form, each clause restating the core insight. The metaphor "afternoon shadow caught in glass" is vivid but its mechanics—how a shadow is preserved decades—remain unexplained, creating mild conceptual fuzz. Proofreading is otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language ("thin as spider silk," "colors sang") is mostly coherent. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "coaxed it, showed it" and "nurturing growth, guiding life, weaving hope" repeat conceptual content without advancing pressure. The phrase "the old magic always demanded something real" is告知 where dramatization would suffice. Overwriting is mild but present in stacked metaphors ("trembling moment before discovery") at a high-pressure beat, slightly dulling clarity. No egregious artifacts, but density could tighten by 10–15%.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is controlled: "accumulated silence the way old churches accumulated prayers" is coherent and anchored. Word choice favors strong nouns and verbs ("teased the knot loose," "refracting them into visible light"). Opening line anchors voice and premise; final line resolves by image that recharges the sanctuary motif. Zero scaffold or synonym churn in peak beats; propulsion is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high—most lines advance discovery, atmosphere, or stakes without padding. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Minor scaffold: "She understood then what the vault was trying to show her" slightly tells what the following lines dramatize, and "Some silences, she now understood, weren't meant to be preserved behind locked doors" edges toward thematic summary. These slip into expository territory but do not obscure causality or dull the closure beat. Figurative language (rain as whispered prayers, map tearing, question mark in cracks) is purposeful and coherent. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean with strong propulsion and varied rhythm. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., the equilibrium passage works as image, metaphor, and choice-moment simultaneously). Opening and closing images are charged. Minor deductions: "quietly analytic as always" is tell-not-show; "the hollow recognition that some disappearances, once solved, left you with less than the mystery had provided" edges toward summary of theme rather than trusting dramatization. Two instances of "physics of letting go" create a slight loop. No other scaffold or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is largely clear with varied sentence structure and vivid sensory anchors ("cloud-condensation and crushed minerals," "cascade of warmth"). However, several text artifacts reduce momentum: "driftingly alert" appears three times as a label without evolving meaning; "unspoken needs" recurs as a phrase without fresh embodiment; "breathless moment between lightning and thunder" functions as stock poetic frame. Paraphrase loop in paragraph 3 ("unuttered words" / "unspoken needs"). Figurative density is high but controlled; no mixed metaphors. Overall rhythm supports the lyric mode, but template cadence and synonym churn lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the floor-by-floor structure creates visual and temporal momentum. Information density is high: most lines advance character (Maren's inquisitive nature), setting (icebound spire details), or plot (diary revelations per floor). Two minor artifacts: "She wasn't looking for treasure or secrets; she was looking for understanding" is a paraphrase loop, and "the way he'd ask about her day as if a servant's thoughts mattered" + "really notice them" recycles the noticing concept without adding pressure. The prismatic-light mechanism is elegantly compressed. Opening and closing images (frosted grating / frozen corridor) create satisfying symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or the categorization project. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Strategic telling compresses the fifteen-year backstory efficiently. Minor deduction: "she understood what he'd tried to tell her" is slightly abstract without showing the specific understanding, and "pressed her palm against the gondola's cold window" is a gestural familiar. The figurative language ("copper rays," "dusty starlight," "planetary ocean") is consistent and POV-appropriate, though "quietly explosive" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character perception or setting detail. Rhythm varies appropriately, tightening at the realization beats ("Yet the portrait remained wrong") and breathing in the contemplative passages. Minor loops present: "fractally precise" appears four times, twice in identical phrasing ("fractally precise detail," "fractally precise measurements," "fractally precise documentation"); "condemned" recurs as descriptor without variation. The phrase "Some knowledge/truths/limits" template appears three times in the final third, creating cadence echo. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks that dull peak beats. Applying patterned-artifact baseline: −0.5 in Q7 for template recurrence in final third, lowering from ~7.7 to 7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse; information density is high with minimal scaffolding. The key discovery beats (chalk marks, coordinate cross-reference, Wayfinder constellation) advance knowledge efficiently without padding. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. One weakness: "wondered if perhaps language itself was a kind of cartography, mapping meaning instead of mountains" reads slightly elevated and thesis-like mid-paragraph, a brief register drift that does not recur. The final paragraph's closing flourish ("translating coordinates into seventeen different ways of saying *here be something wonderful*") borders on lyric overreach but remains voice-coherent and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high; most lines advance setting, action, or theme. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent: "shed skin" for prophecy, "orange moss" for rust, "gear teeth meshing with the sky." Sentence rhythm varies (short action beats, longer descriptive passages). Minor paraphrase risk in the driftwood/beauty-in-decay passage, where "beautiful in its decay" slightly echoes prior "bleached by time and circumstance," but the restatement adds thematic weight rather than looping. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs in high-pressure beats. Proofreading clean; no pronoun drift or tense inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. The opening paragraph sets voice and stakes cleanly. Minor scaffold appears: "she drifted… she manifested… she moved" follows a repetitive stem pattern in the early middle, and "because" is used three times in Mara's final speech, creating slight redundancy. The metaphor "brambled hope" is vivid and consistent. Clarity is strong; no loops or muddles touch the closure beat. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.4)
    Recurring phrases create a self-conscious pattern: "nested patterns" appears at least five times, "bruised awe" twice, "across the hush of time's final ripple" bookends the piece, and "beautifully flawed" recurs without new information. Elevated diction ("vouchsafe," "causation," "probability") in reflective passages reads as register drift from the hands-trembling, puppet-cradling woman on the page. Sentence openings vary, but several beats loop conceptually—paragraph four's "nested patterns" summary is echoed in paragraph six's mechanism description and again in paragraph nine's "nested patterns within nested patterns." The puppet head "rolled free" then is "picked up" and "cradled" without clear spatial choreography between those moments. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (image + theme) but some recycle the same abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is largely clean with strong imagery ("bronze sentinels," "bark rough as grief," "frost forming now, crystalline and lethal"), though some phrases trend toward stock ("sun was already bleeding orange," "dying light," "cold water"). Sentence rhythm varies appropriately with urgency; the final chase sequence uses shorter clauses effectively. One minor paraphrase loop: "The orchard had taught her its secrets reluctantly" echoes "her uncle's graceless beauty" and "graceless in its beauty" without adding pressure. No template cadence or filter stacks. Information density is solid—most lines advance setting, character knowledge, or plot—but the final two paragraphs summarize the thematic resolution rather than trusting the image, reducing propulsion. The "offhandedly exact" notation (47.3 degrees) anchors specificity without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high. Opening and closing images are purposeful. However, mild repetitive phrasing appears: "She had stopped seeing... stopped answering... stopped listening" is effective parallelism, but the subsequent "In trying to avoid... she had severed" paraphrases the same idea within two sentences, creating a small loop. The "pieces were falling into place now" paragraph summarizes Leah's motivation rather than showing it through recalled action. No major artifacts, but these reduce density slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is mostly clean and legible but shows patterned overwriting in figurative clusters: "integrated fragmentation," "mindfully scattered," "reverse ink," "incise patterns into the absence itself" stack metaphor on metaphor without clarifying mechanics. The opening's "quantified the absence carefully—twelve minutes since the ribbon-cutting, zero footsteps" is precise and engaging. However, synonym loops appear: "infinite possibilities still unbroken" (opening) → "infinite beginnings still waiting" (closing); "mindfully scattered" recurs as a descriptor for both profession and clouds without functional variation. The phrase "the place where stories begin" is repeated across three paragraphs without reweighting. No severe artifacts, but density and propulsion sag in the expository middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery and varied rhythm. Information density is high in the pavilion sequence. However, several artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops ("touching, tasting, smoothing" then "touching without being consumed"); template cadence in the descent paragraph ("each one revealing...the way...the direction...the temperature"); and the "unspoken dream" setup feels like scaffolding that's told rather than integrated. The closure image is vivid but the phrase "bearable" appears twice in quick succession, dulling impact. No clarity breaks, but momentum sags slightly in exposition-heavy middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies across paragraphs, and information density is generally high (each detail—meteor iron, ventilation fan, wireless speakers—advances the mechanics). However, paraphrase loops appear: "grain elevator talks" is restated in "silos wanted… to harmonize," and "interspersing languages" is explained twice (once as method, again in the descent scene). Template cadence runs in the middle third: "She began composing… She layered… threading in…" followed by "Her eyes fell… She lifted… feeling…" The phrase "harmonious choral librarian" in the penultimate paragraph feels like scaffold, labeling her role rather than showing it. Filter-verb density ("she understood," "she watched") is moderate but not clustered enough to trigger the stack penalty. Closure image (weight swinging, Mara smiling) is clean and propulsive, limiting non-closure deductions to −0.8 for loops and stems.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.8)
    Heavy overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence in the memory-flood and climax paragraphs carries figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.7). Mixed metaphors: "fossils of what might have been," "ocean of possibility...ships that had never sailed," "helix-minded...spiral down" stack without coherence (−0.5). Register drift into academic jargon ("synaptic plasticity treatments," "neural interface crown") clashes with lyric ambition in peak beats (−0.4). Paraphrase loops: paragraphs 7–9 restate "abandoned dreams" and "entangled memories" across adjacent lines without adding pressure (−0.4). Information density is low; scaffold sentences ("She had entered this profession...") summarize rather than advance. Template cadence: "She [verb]" and "Elena [verb]" stems repeat across six sentences without variation (−0.5). Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several patterns dull momentum. "Clandestinely luminous" and "latent blaze" appear multiple times as decorative labels without evolving function. The final paragraph loops thematically—"seeds of vigilance," "clandestinely," "latent blaze"—restating the mission rather than advancing it. Sentence openings vary, but phrases like "prism-minded," "threshold effects," and "forgotten combinations" recur as static anchors. The climactic beat (stone touch, combinations blazing) is vivid, but the subsequent mission-statement summary flattens closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance craft, atmosphere, or thematic resonance. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the performance sequence ("High notes cascaded like water over stones; low tones rumbled like distant thunder") balances specificity with momentum. Two minor artifacts lower the score: "symphonic possibility" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward abstract theme statement rather than concrete image, and the phrase "empathy in motion" appears as a label in backstory without immediate dramatization. Figurative language is generally apt, though "fossilized spider silk" for telegraph lines mixes organic and inorganic in a way that slightly blurs the vehicle. No loops or scaffold; clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally—short declaratives ("He was listening.") against longer reflective structures. Information density is high: "rolled the polished basalt worry stone, his thumb finding the familiar dent worn smooth by decades" does multiple jobs in one gesture. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The five-silence sequence risks list structure but each carries distinct emotional content (fear/grief/shame/hope) that advances understanding. Minor stock metaphor in "twilight bled across the sky" and "darkness fell," and "emotional architecture" leans abstract, triggering a small deduction. The final paragraph's "translate what others feared to voice" echoes the method language, which could read as thematic convenience, but it's grounded in the prior beats. Overall line-level control is strong with no artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases tip toward overwriting: "the eclectic pacifist who had once traveled with protest singers, radio archaeologists, and monks" front-loads exposition; "the fertile quiet of understanding that one's own listening has only just begun" is labored. Template cadence appears in paired backstory summaries ("she had tried everything... she had discovered"). The closure image is clean, but mid-story figurative density ("amber hum," "silver scratch," "deep burgundy resonance") stacks without clear payoff beyond atmosphere. No loops or major scaffold, but elevated diction occasionally drifts from the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally clean with good information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language serves mood without overwhelming ("botanical air," "undercurrent of wisdom"). However, several minor artifacts accumulate: "blessing and curse" is stock; "the whisper of rot before it showed" and "the exact moment a bloom reached its healing peak" form a slight template pattern of superlative sensitivity. The phrase "at the turning of the tide's thought" receives explanation ("the old Veyla phrase for moments of transformation") that stalls momentum. "Ambitious" appears in both the opening description and the later "her ambitious plans," creating mild redundancy. Propulsion remains solid throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance world logic, Mara's progress, or thematic resonance. However, several phrases carry scaffolding weight: "weighted with purpose," "impossible ecosystem," "the only way to describe," "still amazed her." The opening of paragraph nine ("Then she saw it: a gathering of echoes. That was the only way to describe the phenomenon.") stalls momentum with meta-commentary. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she'd developed," "she watched," "she began to discover") appears but doesn't stack heavily. No loops or major template cadence runs touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high with minimal padding; technical detail serves discovery rather than exposition for its own sake. Sentence structure varies purposefully, and the opening line establishes both voice and stakes. Two minor issues prevent higher scoring: the phrase "hazy precision" appears three times, creating thematic echo that borders on over-emphasis, and "singular convergence" recurs as both investigation finding and authorial concept marker. The closing paragraph contains slight register drift ("cultivating foresight," "architecture of disaster") that edges toward abstract philosophical diction beyond POV lexicon. No major loops or scaffolding artifacts present.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("throat of stars," "flower constructed of mirrors," "oscillating repose") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating register drift in peak beats. The opening and cavern-description paragraphs maintain strong propulsion and information density. However, synonym churn ("unfetter," "liberation," "revealed," "unfolded") and conceptual redundancy (the hush as multiple metaphors across adjacent lines) dull momentum. The phrase "sculpted hush" recurs without evolving use. Zero orientation debt; spatial choreography is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Two paraphrase loops: "The flute didn't belong to one world—it was a needle for weaving between them, a tool for those who needed to step sideways through reality" restates the concept without added pressure (−0.2). "Avalanchingly quiet" appears three times, twice near-identical in framing (−0.2). Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph two ("had been," "had read") but not at peak beat. Figurative language ("fabric," "needle," "doors") is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is often striking ("emotions weren't separate variables but different expressions of the same underlying force"). However, paraphrase loops recur: the operator's lack of original self is restated across three beats ("dissolved like sugar," "no longer tell where she ended," "become a vessel"). Template cadence in the work sequence ("setting type, pressing, examining" repeated with minor variations) creates drag. Mixed metaphor: "love that tasted of copper and rain" blurs sensory coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains clarity and momentum with strong opening and closing images. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (vibration, germination, fade) coheres without mixed metaphors. However, several template patterns appear: "meant to hurry past—he always meant to hurry past," "Things that vibrate together belong together," and the exposition block's parallel structure ("They transform carriers...They germinate wonder..."). The phrase "coaxing travelers to see strangers as companions in mystery" verges on purple abstraction. Information density is generally high, but the Keeper's explanation summarizes rather than compressing transit. No major loops or scaffold, and the seed-warmth closing beat works well.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. The opening anchors cleanly and spatial choreography is coherent throughout. However, several phrases edge toward overwriting: "shifted hush" appears twice, "commune" recurs as both verb and concept without functional variation, and "truthful lies" is deployed three times in a way that reads ornamental rather than pressure-driven. The final paragraph stacks metaphor (quartz formations "sang," "absorbed memories") without clear payoff at the closure beat. No major loops or template cadence, but minor figurative excess in non-peak moments lowers the band.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats. "Stoically sparkling" appears twice, once as phrase and once embedded, reading as a purposeful echo rather than churn. Minor template cadence in the middle third: "Her grandmother had…" "He had…" "She had…" across adjacent paragraphs. The phrase "raveling silence" recurs five times, functioning as a taught motif rather than loop. Figurative language ("gossamer," "honey-colored depths") is dense but controlled. No major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level clarity is strong; no loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Minor overwriting in the opening ("each strike measured and deliberate, though her hands trembled") front-loads exposition. "Azure defiance" and "framing hope" in the final lines elevate register slightly beyond earned image. Information density is good; most lines advance setting, character, or stakes. No text artifacts touch the closure beat. Propulsion is steady but not urgent; the success trajectory doesn't compress syntax under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world rules, or emotional state. "Cathedral of metal ribs" and "translucent pages in an infinite book" are clear, purposeful metaphors. Minor scaffold appears in "This was her gift and her curse" (slightly generic framing) and "cyclically spontaneous as heartbeats that skip" (register wobble). The final paragraph's short declarations create effective cadence. Clarity and momentum hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies appropriately: short urgent beats during the lamp failure and climb, longer reflective passages in the lantern room. Minor scaffold: "She thought about Marcus becoming light for others while darkness filled his own life. She thought about these lighthouse keepers…" uses template stem repetition across adjacent sentences without escalating content (paraphrase-loop check: −0.3). "Luminescent ache" in Marcus's words risks purple but stays just within Vera's image-focused register. Opening and closing beats are strong; the sea glass description does double duty (beauty and metaphor for transformation). Propulsion is clean; no clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the prose carries high information density (lighthouse mechanics, prophecy, newspaper clipping) without scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent—"steered not just through space, but through meaning itself," "painted symbols across the sky that no language had words for"—but remains legible and pattern-motivated rather than overwritten. Two minor artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loop in paragraph three ("he'd never spoken to any reporter" / "He hadn't said those words then") and a template-cadence run ("The wick clicked into place. Light erupted… each reflection splitting… The green brilliance shot"). These do not obscure causality but dull propulsion in high-pressure beats. No loops touch the closure image, preventing heavier deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("humming with iridescent caution," "beauty that could overwhelm," "colors rippled across its surface like water," "searching hands"), and while most images are clear, the accumulation in descriptive beats risks overwriting. Two paraphrase loops: "The effect was quietly explosive, beauty that could overwhelm if you weren't careful" restates the same caution twice in adjacent clauses; "listened… listening… listener" cycles across three lines without new pressure. Template cadence appears in the tea-preparation beat: "preparing tea… lifted a wing… set the wing down" uses identical verb-object stems. The closure paragraph stacks metaphors ("floating sanctuary," "hidden architectures," "iridescent caution," "quietly explosive") without clear propulsion, though the final toast image lands cleanly. Apply artifact penalty −0.8 for density and loops across non-closure beats; escalate slightly because one loop ("quietly explosive, beauty that could overwhelm") appears in the inciting-incident paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual flow. Information density is high in the sextant introduction and tree extraction beats. Minor artifacts: "She'd always wondered what trees witness—what memories live in their rings, what truths their roots gather" uses dashes for synonym expansion without advancing pressure. "The dream healed in moonlight. The sorrow transformed, not erased but resolved" paraphrases across adjacent sentences. "Mundane, miraculous, necessary" in the final paragraph risks theme-label stacking. These accumulate to −0.6 but do not obscure closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies effectively and information density is high in the weaving sequence. Two pattern artifacts lower the grade: "began to [verb]" appears four times ("began to pulse," "began to rise," "began to wake," "were beginning to wake"), and the phrase "on the page" leaks evaluator idiom into narration. Paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "seventeen years—or what passed for years" restates without adding pressure. The figurative language ("splitting of winter ice," "ribbons that danced like aurora") is vivid but clusters heavily in early paragraphs, then thins, creating textural unevenness. No opacity at closure; propulsion is clean in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; the opening crumple anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in the library description. Two artifact penalties: "People called her kind but unreachable" tells rather than shows in backstory; "devoted while distant" and "staying while leaving" become synonym loops across the wedding paragraph, restating the same concept. The phrase "decades of similar confessions" stacks modifiers without concrete image. No loops touch closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied with strong imagery (bronze lions, vines as patient conquerors, pressed flowers). Information density is high; sentences multitask. However, minor overwriting appears: "bread that embodied every perfect loaf" and "understanding blooming like the guerrilla gardens themselves" are slightly ornate metaphors in high-pressure beats. "Tenuous absolution" and "creeping normality" feel prompt-adjacent. Some filter verbs ("watched goldfinches") dull immediacy where directness would sharpen. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the measurement sequence. Minor pattern debt: "She placed it" / "She moved to" / "She came upon" template stems appear three times but don't obscure causality. The phrase "luminous vows" recurs five times, bordering on mantra but justified by Maren's professional idiom. One paraphrase moment: the paragraph beginning "While illusions fade" restates Maren's mission already shown, costing −0.2. No filter-verb stacks or metaphor muddles in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift cleanly. Information density is high: most lines do double work (setting + pressure, interiority + world). Two friction points lower the score: "curiously steadfast" and "comforting unease" are stock modifiers that blur specificity at peak moments, and "the truce of hush" receives three mentions without sufficient causal reweighting to justify the repetition—it edges toward motif-for-motif's-sake. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; proofreading is clean. Propulsion is strong, but the figurative slips in high-pressure beats prevent entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high in the world-building (mycelial networks, Great Reconnection, taste-based sensing). However, template cadence appears in exposition: "The phenomenon had intensified after the Great Reconnection, when humanity had finally learned to sense..." reads as scaffolding. The phrase "terrestrially cosmic" in Mira's thought feels like prompt-fulfillment rather than organic diction. Paraphrase loop: "why certain people carried weather with them" / "why the earth chose some of us to embody its moods" restates the same question without adding pressure. Minor filter-verb stack in the opening weakens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong concrete detail (charcoal dust, limestone, quartz formations). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent summarizing beats: "She'd suppressed her creativity, taken pills to blur the edges, chosen portrait work..." and "She'd taught Elena to do the same: draw what you see, never what you feel" echo structurally and could be tightened. The phrase "mnemonically gifted mind" reads clinical. No paraphrase loops touch the closure. Opening and closing lines anchor well.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Minor scaffold appears: "Mira reread the notations compulsively" followed shortly by "Mira walked among the vessels, reading fragments"—slight synonym churn on the reading/piecing action. "Her motivation crystallized slowly, like frost on greenhouse glass" is elegant but borders on decorative in a high-pressure beat. No major loops or coherence breaks. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Propulsion is steady but a few beats (the weeks of map assembly) are summarized where dramatization might have sharpened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or concept). Minor scaffold appears in "It wasn't the clear tone...It was richer" and the phrase "honest beauty" recurs without added pressure. The closing paragraph uses "symphony/symphonies" three times across five sentences, creating mild template cadence. No loops that obscure causality, but figurative density in the final third ("color of wonder," "symphonies of truth") slightly elevates register during peak beats without breaking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or stakes without padding. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift between subject-verb, prepositional phrase, and subordinate constructions. The miniaturization sequence propels clearly: "opened," "held," "reversed," "watched." Minor loop: "The static remained" after the thimble moment echoes "static in their neural network" from earlier without added pressure, a brief paraphrase slip (−0.2). One metaphor risks slight strain: "mineral hearts pumping something that resembled sap" blends stone/plant in ways that push biological logic, though it serves the wrongness theme. No scaffold or template cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean with varied rhythm and strong opening anchor ("courtyard woke in shades of amber"). Information density is high; beats advance character and plot without padding. Minor template cadence in the courtyard-gathering sequence ("Then Mrs. Abernathy spoke… Then Jorge described") and one paraphrase near the end ("listening heals… giving voice to stories" restates within two lines). No loops or artifacts touch the closure beat, and clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally high with vivid imagery (bioluminescent algae, bone dice, wetsuit). Several paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs weaken momentum: "She moved through... she'd discovered... she worked through... she decoded... she encrypted" creates monotonous subject-verb pacing. Stock metaphor in the spider-web simile ("patiently, methodically, each thread placed with purpose") adds little specificity. The final paragraph stacks near-synonyms ("mysterious yet familiar, recognized by those who needed them most") without propulsion. No critical artifacts that obscure causality, but pervasive scaffolding dulls line-level density.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero paraphrase loops; information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple elements (setting, state, choice). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives during choice moments ("She pressed her hands against the whale's heart and understood"), longer accumulative sentences during descent. Figurative language is coherent and sparse: "gasoline-slick," "crystallized moments," salt-as-memory. The opening and closing lines bracket the arc cleanly. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; propulsion is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically controlled, but suffers from decorative compound coinage that accumulates without always serving pressure: "tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush," "nocturnal haven" cluster densely in the opening third, creating a quasi-ornamental register. Some paraphrase loops appear: "the prophecy hushed at last" echoes "to hush a prophecy" without added pressure. Template cadence in the craft-action beats ("she had spent," "she had learned," "she had decoded") flattens propulsion slightly. No major grammar or continuity errors. Information density is moderate; some sentences do double work (the starflower paper detail roots cosmic in soil) but others linger on atmosphere without advancing stakes. The closure line is clean and image-driven, lifting the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short "You're late" against longer atmospheric builds) and information density is high—most lines do double work advancing character and setting. The opening anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Minimal scaffolding: no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. One minor slip: "the language of structures speaking to those who'll inherit their decay" veers toward abstract elevation in a dialogue beat, though it recovers quickly with the concrete desk seal action. Figurative language (meteors as punctuation, seal as key) remains coherent and tied to stakes without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings show diversity. Information density is high in the opening third, then the middle carries paraphrase loops: "I'm not crazy / I'm careful" distinction is restated multiple times without added pressure; "tragically radiant" appears twice identically. Template cadence emerges in the reflective beats ("She had separated them deliberately... Back when they'd walked... before the resonance structures..."). Stock metaphor "ghostly resolve" and "velvet garden" recur without reweighting. These artifacts concentrate in non-closure beats; the final paragraph tightens and lands cleanly. Applying patterned-artifact baseline (−0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems in middle third, not touching closure), score lands at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and propulsion is generally strong, though a cluster of template stems weakens momentum: "She had forged...she dipped...she set down...she understood" creates mechanical cadence in the opening third. Mixed metaphor: "understanding bloomed cold" pairs organic (bloomed) with contradictory temperature, reducing clarity. Some filter-verb stacking: "She had forged," "She set down," "She understood," "She lifted" across adjacent beats. The phrase "green fire dancing across marble that had witnessed countless quiet rebellions" edges toward stock poetic elevation. Information density is high in most beats, and key action (completing the final character, placing the key) is concrete and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished with vivid imagery ("shadows pooled like spilled ink," "canyon walls that curved like ancient spines"). However, prompt-label language clusters heavily: "serpentine nexus," "richly perceptive," "webs of intrigue," "progressive disclosure," "reed-blown melancholy" appear as inserted phrases rather than earned diction. Template cadence in reflective beats (e.g., "She understood then...," "The seashell fell silent...") and synonym loops around "echo" and "listen" accumulate. Apply −0.6 for patterned artifacts and −0.3 for label-driven register drift. Information density is moderate; momentum sags in the middle third during exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose avoids major loops or scaffold. However, several beats lean toward overwriting: "their whispers rising through the dark water like strings of pearls," "borrowed starlight given shape," "the pure, cold knowledge" stack figurative language without adding clarity or momentum. The phrase "weaves truth as gently as she could" in the dialogue beat mixes metaphor (weaving) with the literal attempt to speak carefully, creating mild incoherence. Information density is generally strong—most lines advance atmosphere or backstory—but the final paragraph's summary ("She salvaged stories from the wreckage, retrieved love from the deep places, built windows") restates theme rather than trusting the enacted moment. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the elevated diction in peak beats (ghost's anguish, Maya's reflection) slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong with varied syntax and vivid images ("harbor gleamed like hammered bronze," "fireflies traced their ancient geometries"). However, several passages show overwriting and template cadence: "scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity" appear multiple times as authorial descriptors rather than dramatized states. The phrase "hidden effort" recurs four times, crossing into paraphrase loop. The final paragraph stacks three long dependent clauses in parallel structure ("Below them...Above them...The whispering parapet...") that, while intentional, slightly stalls momentum. Information density is high but figurative language occasionally crowds peak beats without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and efficient with strong momentum through the investigation. Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances discovery or characterization. Minor issues: "sharply observant eye" is a stock phrase; "steel container about the size of a shoebox" uses an unmotivated simile that slightly softens the scene's texture. The phrase "comfortable lies" appears twice verbatim (opening and closing), which reads intentional but borders on loop. Sentence openings vary adequately, though several middle paragraphs begin with "She" or "Vera" in close succession. No major artifacts, but the prose doesn't achieve the rhythmic precision or figurative originality required for the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("barnacle made of stone and glass," "breadcrumbs from a dying star"), but density drops in the final third: "a future she'd only imagined in her most fevered dreams was finally, impossibly, starting to take shape" recycles sentiment already established. "Hope and terror warring" and "shock of recognition" are stock emotional phrases. No major loops, but the closing paragraph over-explains closure instead of trusting the image. Information density is high early, then softens into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is largely clean with strong specificity ("tarnished to the color of storm clouds," "breath expelled while reciting certain poems") and good information density. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing frame the arc effectively. Two issues lower the score: "positively wistful" and "gleaned redemption" repeat as anchors but feel like template phrases from the prompt rather than organic narrative language; the phrase "lonesome splendor, together yet each alone" in the climax beat stacks modifiers in a way that slightly blurs immediacy. No paraphrase loops or major scaffold, but these pattern artifacts in high-pressure moments trigger the −0.6 deduction range and prevent 9+ eligibility globally.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing plot or atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops and stock metaphors dull momentum: "beginning to resonate"/"now singing" (the key's warming), "logically committed, emotionally certain"/"logically assembling... even as emotion tightened" (repeated thesis rather than dramatized contradiction), and "the ice sang back"/"the ice sang its acceptance" (decorative repetition without reweighting). The phrase "something between flesh and spirit" for Crane's face and "fleshly ethereal knowing" both mix metaphors in ways that obscure rather than clarify. Template cadence appears in several exposition-heavy beats where Crane explains chamber mechanics. These artifacts, while not pervasive, cluster enough to trigger −0.8 under the loop/scaffold screen, and the "fleshly ethereal" muddle adds −0.3 for figurative incoherence.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies appropriately, with longer contemplative sentences in reflective beats and shorter declaratives at closure. Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (setting + character + theme). Minor loop detected: "softly purposeful movements" (paragraph 4) echoes "softly purposeful rhythm" (paragraph 8), a synonym cycle without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "silver coin pressed into dark glass" for moon reflection. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. The final paragraph's declarative list ("one mapper, one moon...") is pattern-taught and pays off. Proofreading clean; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is mostly clean with good information density and varied sentence rhythm. The opening anchors voice effectively. Two patterns lower the score: filter-verb reliance in the middle section ("she noticed," "she'd seen," "she understood") slightly dulls immediacy during key discoveries, and the phrase "a doorway to truth, lit by lanterns that had always shown the way out" in the final paragraph edges toward elevated summary rather than image. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. The line "How he makes his priorities reverberate in your skull" is sharp and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies appropriately, and information density is high in technical beats (clockwork heart's chambers, corrosion, calibration steps). Minor scaffold appears in adjacent-sentence paraphrase: "The corrosion she'd seen as irreversible damage, her grandfather would have recognized as patina" immediately followed by "The frozen gears weren't seized but waiting"—a conceptual loop restating the same insight. Template cadence: "The heart had seemed hopeless, and she'd rendered judgment swiftly, definitively" pairs stock adverbs without fresh specificity. Figurative density spikes in the final third ("storm clouds dissolved into crystalline sky," "gentle cacophony of healing time," "bearing witness in the calm before understanding fully arrived") with mixed effect—some lines charge the closure, others feel ornamental. One clarity slip: "aptly deliberate" in paragraph two reads as narrator intrusion rather than Marcus's POV. Overall propulsion is solid, no major loops, but minor polish issues prevent higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, light scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "The kaleidoscope was her breakthrough. Through the images in a kaleidoscope, the algorithm could process…" echoes "kaleidoscope" without added pressure; "the signal grew stronger" and "the pattern…symmetrical, beautiful, deliberate" both summarize progress rather than dramatizing micro-turns. The final paragraph's "of course…of course" loop feels voice-motivated but trends toward emphasis by repetition. Minor figurative stretch: "dissolved into the sea spray" (mentor's death) reads poetic but vague on causality. No major artifact touches closure, so deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("ghost-light of a billion dead profiles") and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high, advancing mystery and atmosphere in most lines. Two friction points: "brightly attentive since childhood" is a stock descriptor, and the phrase "where all the lost ones sang" in the final paragraph leans poetic without full grounding in prior concrete detail. A brief paraphrase loop appears: "marked 'Quarantine—Memetic Hazard.' Her clearance shouldn't have granted access, but it opened anyway" could compress. No major artifacts touch closure, but template cadence appears in mid-section exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong imagery ("shadows clung to her like oil on water," "understanding slowly assembling like ice forming on water"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Two minor artifacts: "She was what the coastal towns called a shadow-laced peacekeeper" opens with a was-construction that slightly delays entry, and the mirror sequence includes a brief template run ("She held… She moved… She began…") across three consecutive sentences. No loops or major scaffold; propulsion is smooth except for the summarized mirror montage, which compresses key discoveries into telling rather than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high—most lines do double work (parasol as survival tool and letting-go symbol, ice damage as literal and thematic). No paraphrase loops detected. Mild scaffold: "Now she gripped reality loosely" and "The world had become translucent, provisional" restate the same shift across adjacent sentences in paragraph two, costing ~−0.2. One figurative string in the opening (salt/diesel, boats creaking, drift ice) risks density but remains purposeful and embodied. The final line ("life insisting she finally, fully, listen") uses an adverb stack that slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats. The opening hooks with the bus/fog/sentinel image. However, the final paragraph loops thematic content: "forever mismatched, finally understood" restates what "learning to honor the space between them" already conveyed. The phrase "destined to fail" echoes "destined mismatches" without added pressure. Minor template cadence in exposition ("I do," "I wanted," "I needed"). No major clarity breaks, but −0.3 for paraphrase loops in closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines doing double duty (e.g., "The parapet hummed under her feet" anchors setting and introduces kinetic mechanisms). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Some figurative language clusters without quite overwriting: "moth's wing," "wind through reeds," "morning mist," "like snow" all appear but remain legible and support the whisperfield tone. Minor: "strangely honest in his directness" is a slight tell-not-show moment, and "She had studied the method all her life" front-loads exposition that could be inferred from action. Propulsion remains steady; no momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear and imagistic ("purple blooms, their fragrance mixing with the metallic tang," "jutted from the earth like broken teeth"), with purposeful rhythm and varied sentence structure. However, several phrases repeat conceptual ground without adding pressure: "the arc is the hardest part" is both stated and paraphrased, "beautiful, necessary work of beginning again" over-explains the transformation already shown, and "perceptively calm" / "earnest whimsy" are told labels rather than embodied through action. Template cadence appears in the drawing sequence ("Hands that had assembled… Fingers that had signed… The teenagers, surprisingly bold") with parallel constructions that feel mechanical. The final paragraph stacks declarations ("no longer symbols of ending but of…," "already imagining the next set") that tell rather than trust the image. Minor filter-verb use ("She believed," "noting the particular shade") dulls immediacy in a few beats.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (the crystal both tool and metaphor, dawn both setting and threshold). Rhythm varies appropriately, and no paraphrase loops appear. Two frictions lower the score: repeated "something" constructions ("something older," "something denser," "something more than themselves") create a minor template cadence in the middle third, and the phrase "the knowing that comes before knowing, the song that precedes the words" stacks near-synonyms without adding pressure. Neither obscures causality, but they dull immediacy in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm varies naturally; figurative language is dense but coherent (fog as magnetic tape, cells as inferior copies, grief as something that "nests"). Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deductions: "the sound of growing older, which he had heard once in a dream that might have been a premonition, or might have been just a dream" hedges without pressure payoff, and "beautiful losses" in paragraph seven reads slightly precious. The final paragraph's stacked clauses ("Tomorrow… The day after… The day after that") risk list-rhythm but remain purposeful and earn closure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift between subject-verb and participial phrases without mechanical repetition. Information density is high in the restructuring sequence. However, figurative language clusters in high-pressure beats without always earning its space: "organs of a clockwork heart," "luminous ache," "grammar of precision instruments," "bittersweet recognition" stack metaphor and abstraction where concrete action would sharpen momentum. Minor paraphrase loop: "The old parameters are gone" followed immediately by restating the same insight. No major artifacts obscure closure, but the density of elevated diction in key beats nudges toward overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Opening and closing lines anchor well. Minor loop: "the scent…of something green and beginning, impossible to name but unmistakable. / The scent of hope, she thought, smells like Sunday mornings" restates the same content across adjacent sentences without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the reconciliation beat: "saw her pause…saw Rebecca take…saw her father produce" (three identical stems) dulls propulsion (−0.4). Figurative language ("light…pulsing with a stillness," "hymning the mundane") is purposeful but occasionally elevated ("cleaved their relationship like an axe through wood") in a way that borders on stock metaphor. Scaffold is minimal; no clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several artifacts appear. Opening stem repetition: "She'd found it," "She picked up," "She turned to," "She moved to," "She examined it" clusters template cadence across the middle section. The phrase "quietly deliberate" in the opening is recycled as "smiled quietly, deliberately" at the close without reweighting. One paraphrase loop: "the shadows weren't disappearing—they were trying to wake" restates the "sealed awakenings" concept without added pressure. Figurative language is controlled, but these line-level slips accumulate to −0.8 per the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mostly clean and propulsive, with strong specificity in key images: "construction of straw and river clay," "root still pink with blood," "violet-silver" rose. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the tooth discovery. However, the final paragraph accumulates abstract phrasing and near-loops: "bone setting for the between-places" echoes "bridge the gap"; "how to make light from fractures, how to transform every mistake" creates a template-cadence run. The metaphor "warm as a star being born" is vivid but slightly strained. Information density is high through most beats, though the closing becomes more diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or thematic charge. Clarity is strong. Three pattern artifacts: (1) "Tomorrow more children would come. Tomorrow the tide would bring new glass to transform. Tomorrow she would continue…" is anaphoric template cadence that mechanically cycles rather than propelling; (2) "how Elena had loved…How she'd asked…How she'd…" runs parallel stems in the backstory block; (3) minor filter-verb stack in "The grotto seemed to breathe…the tone of the space shifting…" where "seemed" and "tone of" dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the penultimate and closure-adjacent beats, lowering the ceiling. Otherwise, rhythm varies, metaphors (frozen river, pearl of stillness) are coherent, and no paraphrase loops. Deduction baseline −0.6 in Q7 for template cadence near closure, plus −0.3 for filter-verb stack.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence rhythm and some striking images ("corridors of green light," "crystalline patterns on the concrete floor"). However, several passages display overwriting: "cathedral of reconciliation," "tsunami of judgment," "protected vulnerability cracked open," and "two witnesses learning to dream awake" stack metaphors without grounding them in concrete action. The phrase "honeyed hush Maya had been cultivating" exemplifies elevated diction that clashes with the POV's immediacy. Minor template cadence in the opening (server racks draped, cooling pipes dripped) and a few filter-verb stacks ("seemed to struggle," "felt like") slightly dull momentum. The final paragraph's "garden of transformed failure" reads as thematic summation rather than earned image.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is strong with varied rhythm and high information density in most beats. However, the middle third exhibits mild template cadence: "The first appeared... The second came... More came..." structures the mist-figures with mechanical parallelism rather than varied syntax. Minor paraphrase loop: "shapes of hope" recurs often without functional variation. "Swirling hush" bookends the piece purposefully. Figurative language is controlled—"mist like breath against glass," "chambers of possibility"—and avoids mixed metaphors. Momentum is sustained; no major clarity lapses.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with strong concrete detail (brass framework, copper wire, geometric perfection). However, template cadence appears in the climax: "The sound that emerged... The harvest moon... The vine tendril... The air smelled..." clusters four consecutive subject-verb stems at the peak beat. Figurative language density increases without pattern-teaching: "music as architecture," "songs poured through brass and wood and living green," "velvet" hush. The exposition-heavy opening (grandmother's role, seven years of study, village opinion) front-loads summary where scene pressure would grip harder. Minor paraphrase loop: "trying to understand how forgotten songs could serve as medicine" restates the premise already established.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and several images are striking: "skeleton's outstretched fingers," "perpetually caught between twilight and dawn," "water finding its course." Information density is moderate—most lines advance atmosphere or process. However, minor redundancies appear: "patient precision" echoed by "never rushing, never hesitating," and the extended explanation of heartbeat-to-map translation in the observatory logbook section slows momentum. A few stock phrases ("most precious possession," "felt sacred") and one paraphrase loop (patience described twice in adjacent paragraphs) reduce propulsion. Clarity remains high; no major grammar or logic errors. The final line borders on thesis statement rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the reconstruction sequence. Two minor loops: "The broken timer mechanism became his obsession" followed immediately by "He would sit for hours studying its corroded innards" restates focus without advancing it. "Reflections bloomed across the stone like flowers opening—not just light, but captured moments" layers metaphor but the dash-clause feels like a hedge against the initial image's clarity. Otherwise propulsive and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm modulates well—short declaratives ("She understood now: she was not trapped") anchor longer lyric passages. Information density is high: the burner's brass oxidation both describes and implies symbolic fit, rivulets carving channels both grounds the season and mirrors the weaver's search for pattern. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense but coherent: fractal gestures, shingled hush, whalebone reverie, calcification all serve the transformation motif without mixed vehicles. One scaffold phrase—"The shingled hush pressed against her ears. That was what her grandmother had called…"—slightly delays momentum with meta-explanation, and the burden catalog (seven named in quick succession) risks list rhythm, though each crystallizes into distinct mineral with sensory payoff. Propulsion remains clear through accumulation and final departure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., rain both anchors setting and mirrors loss/transformation). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language is purposeful but dense in the opening and middle ("aquarium of gray light," "rust-hued peace," "time made visible in rings"). Some metaphoric clustering in non-peak beats slightly elevates texture without obscuring clarity. The kettle's progression and the final bowl image land cleanly. One small artifact: "Here and gone" recurs as a structuring phrase, which is pattern-taught but edges toward insistence.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies well, and information density is high in key beats (carousel debris, ghost approach, camera wheel drop). Two accumulating patterns lower the score: paraphrase loops appear ("her own ambitions had eroded slowly" / "the resolute girl who'd climbed here had become this fractured thing" restates the same erosion concept across paragraphs without added pressure), and several figurative constructions in succession ("fractured stillness—violent and calm simultaneously, moving and frozen" / "regret tasted like cloud-mist") create density that occasionally slows momentum in the middle third. Clarity remains intact, and the final paragraph accelerates cleanly. No grammar or tense errors.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high: the sextant, water stains, and blueprints each do multiple jobs (object, constraint, metaphor). Rhythm modulates well from survey task to night-long drafting. Two line-level issues lower the score: "functionally creative in the way only desperate optimism allowed" is a telling summary rather than shown action, and "ghost rivers of purpose" plus "maze of intentions" risk metaphor stack in adjacent paragraphs. Sentence openings vary, and no loops or template cadence appear.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in key beats (the sketchbook unpacking, the crystal hum). However, several paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "abandoned dream" / "abandoned… no longer quite so silent" / "abandoned anymore"; "make peace" / "making peace"; "hidden sunrise" bookends without mid-scene pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "She would return… She would submit… she would apprentice… start again… bear whatever… claim it… packed… walked back…" (five consecutive "she would/she [verb]" stems). These artifacts dull propulsion in the closure beat. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "suspended time" and "music box finding its rhythm" work, though "contraband drawings" strains credibility (who forbids personal sketches?). Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, plus −0.3 for the final-third artifact presence, totaling −0.9 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong imagery ("crystalline blue," "liminal space," "negative architecture"). Information density is solid; most sentences advance understanding or atmosphere. However, several passages loop conceptually: "The architecture of lies... wasn't about false buildings... It was about misdirection itself" and the subsequent paragraph restate the same insight. The phrase "serene upheaval" appears twice (once in the final paragraph, once earlier) without meaningful evolution. Stock metaphors like "truth-seekers looked right through them" and "stepped sideways into the architecture of his own creation" are competent but not fresh. Minor template cadence in the middle third ("She had been looking... Searching for...") slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clear, rhythmically varied, and free of loops or scaffolding. Sentences advance through sensory detail and embedded information ("modified monkey's fist with an unusual inward spiral"). Some overwriting appears in reflective beats: "revelation came only to those willing to wait" and "infinitely patient with time's own knots" verge on stock philosophizing. The final paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("weight of all those secret weavers watching") that dull immediacy. No major artifacts, but density could increase by cutting contemplative paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (the thread anchors three beats: discovery, conversation, closure). Clarity is strong with no loops or scaffolding. Minor overwriting in the opening: "its lanterns fading into the fog like dying stars" and "a landscape of lonesome splendor" cluster figurative language in quick succession without pattern-teaching. The phrase "a kind of geographical exile from her own life" and "the slow work of a soul finding its way back to the body it had abandoned" edge toward elevated abstraction that slightly tensions the otherwise concrete voice. No artifacts touch closure, so deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose maintains clarity, but several template stems recur: "The palace [verb]," "Cael [verb]," "They [verb] through the night." Figurative language is dense—"quaking reverie," "impossible colors," "predated the Great Mechanization"—but mostly ornamental rather than doing double work. The phrase "bitterly sweet" is used three times, twice as direct repetition and once as "bitterly sweet at best," creating a loop without escalation. Minor scaffold appears in "not from external force but from within," a clarifying aside that stalls momentum at the hatch beat.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense without collapsing into muddle. Information density is high in the opening exposition (fifteen years of arson, decade of firefighting) compressed efficiently. However, several beats loop thematically without advancing pressure: the grafting metaphor is explained three times (grandmother's trees, the coin's origin, "wounds grafted into wholeness"), and "scars can sing" appears as premise, dialogue, and closing image without meaningful reweighting. The phrase "gracefully alert" is repeated verbatim in two paragraphs. Minor template cadence in the coin-reveal beat: "She opened...Inside lay...She had found..." Propulsion slows in the middle third as metaphor accumulates faster than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong images like "lantern that cast more questions than light" and "fountains sang softly in defiant hush." However, several passages loop or restate: "skepticism didn't vanish...but it evolved" is immediately paraphrased by "a doubt that acknowledged mystery." The phrase "defiant hush" appears three times without functional variation. Figurative density is high but occasionally mixed ("oil on water" for stained glass, then "colors shifting" without clear vehicle). Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template-cadence repetition ("characteristic," "peculiar," "inevitable"). Line-level clarity holds at closure, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Strong images: "mist remembering water," "wind through crystal chimes," "quiet sigh of falling petals." Minor scaffold: "They sent out gentle pulses—sonar pinging…searching for the newest arrivals. The technique was ancient…" restates the same search action across two sentences. Light paraphrase loop in paragraph explaining theme ("Your ancestors made this same transit…Each generation believes their struggle is unique") where content overlaps without added pressure. No loops touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; sentences often do multiple jobs (e.g., "His epitaph came from a Neruda poem he'd recited the last dinner they'd shared, before the cancer silenced his voice" anchors backstory, motivation, and loss in one line). Minor scaffold appears: "She understood then" and "But she understood now" are paraphrase loops that restate arrival at insight. The phrase "thundering calm" (monarchs' wings) is vivid but borders on oxymoron without clear grounding. Figurative language is controlled and voice-appropriate; no major template cadence or filter-verb stacks that dull peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "The tower stood where land met sea..." anchors, sets tone, and stakes dependency). Rhythm varies purposefully, especially at closure where syntax lengthens into measured cadence. Minor loop: "keeping time, keeping secrets, keeping faith" is purposeful parallelism but borders repetitive template; the effect justifies it. Some filter verbs ("felt like," "understood") in reflective passages, acceptable for voice but slightly dulling immediacy. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high—most sentences advance plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor issues: "velveteen gloom" is used twice (opening of silo investigation and closing paragraph), creating a small loop; the phrase "tenderly organized" appears in both the living/dead reflection and the grandmother's archive description, functioning as a thematic thread but risking echo. The chess-match framing and tapestry investigation are woven efficiently. Sentence openings vary and no major template cadence or filter-verb stacks appear. Deduction for modest repetition that slightly dulls momentum without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity and grammar are clean. Sentence variety is adequate, though several paragraphs open with "She" or "The" in runs. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "acknowledging their ignorance" / "courage to acknowledge what remained unknown" and "mapped ignorance" / "cartography of ignorance" restate the same idea across paragraphs. Information density is moderate; the middle section describing the writing process could compress further without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm variation and selective sensory detail. The opening "fingers ached as she transcribed the final measure" and "mist pressed against the narrow window like a living thing" demonstrate strong concrete imagery. However, several template cadences and paraphrase loops appear: "Tonight, like most nights, she waited" immediately before "The pirate broadcast always came at odd hours"; "not quite peaceful, not quite dangerous" formula; and the final paragraph's repetitive "one [X] at a time" structure. The phrase "story-seeds sleep in the smallest grains" and "teach them the tongue of before" in the broadcast feel more like thematic placeholders than Elena's specific discovery. Stock metaphor "like smoke through fingers" and the closing "one careful notation at a time" echo the opening without reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual breath. Information density is high in key beats (mask discovery, ash-word reveal). However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "The gallery wasn't vanishing at its edges—it had never been complete. They'd all chosen to see wholeness where fragments existed" restates the same insight across adjacent sentences without added pressure. Template cadence: "She lifted...She held...She understood...She thought...She returned...She sat" stacks subject-verb stems across the middle third without pattern-taught payoff, triggering −0.4 in Q7. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Figurative language (fog, dissolution, ash) is coherent and purposeful, but the paraphrase loop and template run prevent entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (each line advances setting, stakes, or character). Opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor deductions: "That was before he'd chosen rational rebellion over their comfortable narratives" is slightly tell-heavy; "The candles flickered as she departed" is a stock transition. "Abrasive calm" recurs as a phrase without fresh embodiment mid-scene. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but a few lines lean on scaffold ("he realized") where image could carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.4)
    Several passages rely on abstract summary rather than scene work: "The timeframe across unlearning hatred wasn't measured..." and "the casual cruelties that denote difference as deficiency" tell thematic stakes rather than showing them. The phrase "harmonious choir teacher" appears twice verbatim. Figurative language is purposeful ("leaves pressed against the glass like illuminated manuscripts") but occasional elevated diction ("expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness") clashes with concrete action. No major loops or mechanical templates, but density could increase by dramatizing the humming exercise's friction.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clear and propulsive with varied syntax. Strong specifics anchor key images: "rust-flaked soil," "skin warm with stored starlight." However, paraphrase loops appear: "not chaotic, but gently reorganizing" / "didn't replace her own but nestled beside them" restate the same reassurance. "Gentle rebellion—not loud, not violent, but persistent" is template cadence. Filter-verb stacks in reflection ("She could taste," "She tasted," "who'd eaten") dull immediacy. The phrase "synaptic plasticity" recurs three times, twice in exposition, creating scaffold rather than drama. Minimal but measurable drag.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (the blackout cause, drone mechanics, Chen's regret, and Mira's trait all land economically). The riddle-in-matchbox conceit is concrete and propels the beat. Minor loop: "purposeful" appears twice in close succession ("purposeful ambiguity," implied purpose/efficiency binary), and "wonder" recurs four times in the final third without pattern-teaching—borderline churn. One filter-verb cluster ("She was candid… cursed… incapable") in the opener is acceptable for orientation but could tighten. The phrase "elaborate death" is vivid, though "resurrect wonder" in the penultimate line risks abstraction; overall clarity and momentum remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rhythmic and image-dense with strong propulsion: "bottle caps, smoothed glass, a waterlogged paperback" and "a shard of hush, sharp enough to cut through the constant noise of existence." Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Minimal loops; information density is high. However, "inadvertently profound" and "hushed blaze of recognition" edge toward elevated diction that slightly tensions the POV's lexicon in peak beats, and the stacked metaphors in the climax ("shard of hush," "hushed blaze") risk overwriting density without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with high information load per sentence; figurative language (brine through hairline cracks, coral colonizing monuments, bubbles spiraling) is purposeful and vivid. Rhythm modulates well between the statue's layered memories and Marina's present-tense choices. Minor loop: "incisively kind" appears twice in close proximity as a descriptor for the statue's consciousness, and "cascading revelations" / "thread" recur frequently without always adding new pressure. The "threading" motif borders on over-reliance but remains functional. No clarity loss or scaffold detected; sentence openings vary and paragraphs breathe appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. "The staircase itself seemed to embody perpetual motion—each step leading to another without destination" is precise and propulsive. Minor register drift: "balancedly daring" and "rupture that had split her life into before and after" occasionally elevate diction beyond Mara's spoken idiom, though they remain legible. The transition from void-fall to waking desk compresses cleanly. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and image effectively. Zero scaffolding or synonym churn; clarity and momentum are maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with strong imagery (moon "burned through the smog like a coin pressed against dirty cloth"). A few paraphrase loops appear: the grandmother's wisdom is stated ("They can burn the books...") then paraphrased two paragraphs later ("The moon remembered every language..."), and "methodically hopeful" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence in the daydream sequence ("Another stroke, another vision...") is brief and does not obscure causality, but density dips slightly in the middle third where visions illustrate theme rather than advance on-page choice. No major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies appropriately; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual breathing room. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor loops: "displaced" appears five times across the piece (title concept, but borders on churn), and "carrying forward" / "carried through" recur without added pressure. The phrase "historically oriented community, people who understood that cultures survived through deliberate preservation" is scaffold—rephrasing the same idea without new detail. "Rosewater dread" is vivid but slightly forced as a descriptor (what literal smell produces "rosewater dread"?). Figurative language is controlled and voice-appropriate. No runs of template cadence or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Proofreading is clean; no typos or grammar errors detected.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the yoyo's description and the stone's transformation. However, multiple lines loop conceptually: "bleak exhilaration" appears three times; "directions could be reversed" is restated as "time, like fate, was merely a direction." The phrase "latent radiance" recurs without evolving in meaning. Figurative language is dense but occasionally mixed: "light poured from it, not outward but inward, pulling reality toward itself like water circling a drain" works, but "membrane between what was and what could be" is generic high-concept phrasing. Template cadence appears in the yoyo description: "The axle wasn't fixed but floating... The string unwound... And at its core..." Apply paraphrase-loop and template penalties totaling −0.8 in Q7, plus minor figurative drift −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is mostly clean with varied rhythm and strong images ("condensation forming on cold metal," "wound opening"). The "lingering luminance" phrase repeats three times, creating subtle pattern. However, several scaffolding phrases appear: "knew the resuscitation had changed her in ways she couldn't yet name" front-loads mystery generically; "gnawed at her thoughts" is stock; "what we fear most" in the final lines edges toward summary. The middle section includes minor synonym churn around "fear" and "dread." Information density is good overall but key beats could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong concrete nouns ("xylophone mallet," "copper wire," "driftwood platform"). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. However, several lines drift toward purple ornament: "restless euphony," "sketched resonance," "acoustic patterns translating to nautical truth" cluster in the middle third, elevating diction without always advancing immediacy. Minor paraphrase loop: "Every obstacle became an instrument" is stated twice in close proximity (middle and near-end). The figurative density in non-peak beats (blue hour description, fractal metaphors) occasionally prioritizes texture over momentum. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "She had been quietly driven to this edge for three years" establishes duration, motive, and spatial position). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor overwriting: "The note carried across the empty shell-plaza where few citizens ventured anymore" adds "anymore" after "empty" already signals abandonment. The phrase "something like grief" and "shadow-water" are slightly stock. Figurative language is controlled and does not cluster in high-pressure beats. Propulsion is steady; no momentum sinks.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. A modest paraphrase loop appears: "They weren't villains… They were people" restates the prior paragraph's insight without adding pressure. The phrase "emotionally rational" recurs three times as a label without embodied demonstration. Stock metaphor "truth was finally blooming into light" in a high-stakes beat slightly dulls the closure image. No severe artifacts, but the accumulation nudges the score down within the 6-band.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose demonstrates strong sensory work and purposeful rhythm in places ("The brass had oxidized to a green patina that reminded him of everything the water had taken"). However, multiple artifacts accumulate: "hushed blaze quality—quiet as held breath, yet burning with the intensity of everything that once mattered here" is self-explaining metaphor; "stoic sensitivity" and "interlaced absence" appear as labels rather than dramatized states; "wrest" appears three times across the story in template fashion. Paraphrase loop: the final paragraph restates Marcus's mission in slightly varied language without adding pressure. The figurative density in the opening third (oxidized brass, mourning veils, cathedral of green light, held breath) approaches overwriting without clear payoff. Total deduction in Q7: −1.4 for patterned artifacts and loops, with −0.2 additional for the template reuse of "wrest."

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, though several lines edge toward overwriting: "archaeology of meaning," "swimming shadows across spines bloated with absorbed seawater," "electricity of a different sort." The phrase "tranquilly perceptive" appears twice as a set descriptor rather than embodied perception. Minor scaffold: "She'd seen this phrase before, months ago" followed immediately by navigation to retrieve it—efficient but slightly mechanical sequencing. "Thunder rolled through water and stone above—the storm that had knocked out power still raging" restates information already established. Figurative density in descriptive passages ("pulse quickened with dappled resolve," "lamplight bubble") accumulates without always advancing pressure, applying −0.4 for moderate density without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; sentences often do double duty (e.g., lantern mechanics reveal both world and character ingenuity). The phrase "luminous torment" recurs purposefully. Minor scaffold: "The memory gem brightened" appears twice in similar contexts, and "transform" appears as both verb and noun in close proximity. The final quatrain (transform, polish, fold, release) is rhythmically strong, but the penultimate paragraph's "eight hundred and fifty-two cranes remained" echoes an earlier "eight hundred and fifty-three remained" without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the hunt. The opening ("floating observatory drifted through polar stratosphere, its hull creaking as circuit breakers clicked and hissed") anchors voice and stakes. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "The geode crystal sat on her workstation" followed immediately by "Dr. Vahedi had given it to her after the incident, after the hospitals and the silent flights home"—the second "after" feels like synonym churn. One paraphrase loop: "Potential energy, locked in stone" near the start echoes "unrealized possibilities still vibrated" a few paragraphs later without added pressure. No figurative muddle, but these small slips prevent entry to the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with varied syntax and strong rhythm modulation ("stars began emerging in the brilliant dimness"). Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Two minor loops: "surprised again" echoes the trait label without fresh embodiment, and "frequency of belonging" repeats across three beats without evolving meaning. The metaphor "cosmic strings" and "vast mandala" are vivid and coherent. No significant scaffold or template cadence. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and clarity is maintained throughout. However, the piece carries template-cadence runs in the backstory section ("She'd built," "She'd found," "They died") and paraphrase loops around Mara's guilt ("the weight of unspoken words," "the enormous weight of truth," "the weight of a withheld truth"). Stock metaphors ("time had stopped," "weight of truth") and therapy-speak labels ("tempered regret," "quell the panic") appear in peak beats, dulling immediacy. These artifacts prevent entry into the 8+ range and trigger the −0.6 baseline deduction for template cadence plus −0.3 for label reliance in emotional moments.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is solid: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Opening and closing images are strong and purposeful. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph: "storm-worn" appears twice in three lines, and "peculiar liminal space" leans abstract where concrete detail would sharpen. The phrase "when nations had acknowledged their wrongs but trust remained unbuilt" is explanatory rather than dramatized. Clarity and concision are otherwise strong; no significant artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines advance character, stakes, or atmosphere. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve effectively. Two minor artifacts lower the score: "backlash of regrets hit Marina like it always did—sudden, breathtaking—phantom guilt" uses a predictable metaphor structure in a peak beat (−0.3), and "merrily plotting their course while joking with the captain, melancholic already" stacks modifiers that slightly blur rather than sharpen (−0.2). Sentence openings vary and no paraphrase loops appear. The "poles seventeen/twenty-three" detail and "weathered wood and sagging wire" show strong specificity without ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure. However, several phrases loop: "the knowledge that," "the shape of," "the impossible baseball's lesson" echo across paragraphs. The opening's "delicately robust—ancient yet trembling with fragile life" works as purposeful oxymoron but similar constructions recur. "Jaded wonder" and "jaded but genuine" repeat the descriptor. Some filter-verb stacks in reflective beats ("stared at," "looked out at," "turned...in his hands") slightly dull immediacy. Information density is moderate; the middle passage explaining J. Martinez could compress. No major clarity breaks but momentum sags in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (constellation-patterns, moonlit water) charges key images. "Paradoxically steady" in paragraph one and its reprise near the end bookend the transformation arc. However, lines like "pain and joy indistinguishable, cosmic intimacy made flesh and spirit" stack abstractions in a high-pressure beat where concrete sensation would sharpen. "She could feel him too" is functional but borderline redundant after "I can feel you." Minimal loops, high clarity overall, but peak beats occasionally trade specificity for lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density—most sentences advance character, image, or pressure. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language ("moonlight pooled like spilled mercury," "choking beauty") is coherent and voice-motivated. Two minor frictions: the phrase "her daughter deserved better than a mother who climbed clouds to find what she'd already abandoned" is a near-summary that slightly softens momentum, and "the knowledge of what she might still save" edges toward scaffold. No loops, no synonym churn, and the final line is concrete and charged. Opening and closing images are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (ship history, shadow work, shimmer-patterns all compress efficiently). The apparatus activation beat propels cleanly: "lights dimmed...photographs began to glow...The Tear blazed." No loops or scaffold. Minor deductions: "emotion too complex to name" is an evasion rather than embodied interiority; "ghostly resolve" appears twice as unvaried stock phrasing; "the terrible beauty of completion" at closure leans toward purple without sharp sensory anchor. Overall clarity and momentum remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high. No major loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("morning mist," "vibrant hush," "granular"). Minor overwriting: "the texture she'd been seeking" and "Transformation wasn't sharp or sudden. It was gradual, granular" paraphrase the same insight. Stock metaphor: "planets continued their ancient dance." Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "recognized") cluster in reflective passages but stay voice-motivated. Proofreading is clean. Opening and closing images anchor well.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening beats (lamp death, practiced movement, bronze quill holder positioned). Clarity is strong throughout. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "luminous fort…white stone walls glowing" restates the title image, and "quiet, persistent, impossible to extinguish" in dialogue is echoed by "sparks of change began to glow" in narration. The final two paragraphs recycle "darkness" and "glow" without adding new pressure. No grammatical errors; propulsion is steady but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "water no longer crashed but glided," "eels... drifted like silk," "dust settled like fog with weight," "answer bloom like bioluminescence." In calmer beats this enriches texture; in the stone-placement sequence (paragraphs 10–17) it slows momentum—nearly every sentence carries a simile or metaphor, creating a decorative effect that competes with propulsion. Two minor paraphrase loops: "seeing futures that might never arrive and pasts that hadn't yet occurred" restates the curse concept, and "the eels sang mathematics into the frictionless night, and she finally understood the sacred geometry of letting go" doubles the insight. Sentence openings vary; no filter-verb stacks. The overwriting in peak beats prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "electrical veins," "cartography of scars," "rarefied truth," "conspiracy of whispers," "broken promise city." In peak beats (the storm paragraphs, closure vigil), nearly every sentence carries metaphor without clear pattern-teaching or fresh pressure; this risks overwriting. Template cadence appears in the timer-ritual framing: "Twenty minutes of watching. Twenty minutes of writing…" recurs without variation. Minor paraphrase loop: "she was still here, still breathing, still witness" and "remained at her post, keeping vigil" restate endurance without added charge. Information density is solid elsewhere; no hard causality breaks, but the figurative load blunts momentum in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies, and sensory detail is concrete ("brass gears visible through crystalline panels," "Danish tin sewing needle card"). However, the final paragraph loops thematically—"questions without answers, destinations without maps" restates earlier dialogue without adding pressure. The phrase "diplomatically fierce" and "dignified chaos" read as over-engineered descriptor stacks. Minor scaffold: "the brook sang on" is a stock closer.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere without padding. The simile "like a sardine can" and metaphor "liquid silver" are vivid and coherent. Minor loop: "beauty" appears five times in the final third, risking echo fatigue, though each use serves a distinct beat (beauty from anarchy, beauty killed, beauty possible). "Luminous fracture of everything" borders on purple but stays within the lyric-toned voice. Proofreading is clean; no grammar slips. The improvised poem's line breaks and rhythm fit the "penny poem" frame. One paraphrase slip: "forget the specific joy" and "forgetting was part of the work" restate adjacently without added pressure.

    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The compasses weren't malfunctioning—they were triangulating across time" immediately followed by restating the station's suspension in nearly identical terms. Template cadence in the opening ("just as her heart had memorized every departure") and filter-verb reliance in reflective beats ("she realized," "she had watched") slightly dull immediacy. The final paragraph's "smiled and played a song about arrival" edges toward summary rather than image. Figurative language (clouds rolling like ocean waves, horizon inviting darkness) is vivid but occasional mixed registers ("temporal displacement," "strategically creative") jar against the lyric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentences vary in rhythm and structure; information density is high (each paragraph advances Kima's choice or deepens stakes). Minor scaffold: "She had been testing the claim through interpreted dreams" frontloads exposition; the dreams themselves arrive as summary list rather than immediate scene. The phrase "empirically whimsical method available to her" reads as meta-commentary scaffolding. Clarity and propulsion are strong through the planting beat. No loops or contradictions in the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is generally controlled, but the piece carries pervasive overwriting in peak beats. "Tides of remembrance," "meditation made audible," "color of unspoken apologies—that particular shade of blue that exists only between sky and sea, between truth and forgiveness" stack metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. The final paragraph compounds this: "shades of apology and forgiveness," "the precise blue of healing," "holding space for all the words" read as overlapping vehicles without clear tenor. Template cadence appears in Takeo's instruction beats ("This knot means… This space means… This crossing means"), and filter verbs ("felt something shift," "could feel") dull immediacy. Applying overwriting density (−0.5), mixed metaphor drift (−0.4), and template cadence (−0.4) totals approximately −1.3 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, vivid, and purposeful, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (character, setting, and theme) without visible scaffold or loops. Figurative language is controlled and thematically aligned, returning to light, weight, and transformation without feeling repetitive or purple. Syntax and paragraphing create a natural rhythm that supports the quiet accumulation of insight. A few lines lean into explicit explanation, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, with varied sentence rhythm and strong, specific diction; most lines do multiple jobs (advancing plot while layering atmosphere or theme). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and metaphors are coherent and rooted in the story’s material (glass, frost, fire). There are no obvious loops, scaffolding sentences, or syntactic tics that drag momentum, and grammar and mechanics are solid. A few abstractions (“beauty made enemies,” “burning without purpose”) could be grounded more concretely, but they don’t materially blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and efficient: most sentences do at least two jobs (advancing action, deepening emotion, or sharpening image) without scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors (e.g., “emotion become landscape,” “hope…like pink dawn”) are coherent and thematically aligned, and figurative density stays just below the point where it would bog momentum. Grammar and rhythm are clean, with varied sentence structures and no noticeable template cadences or synonym loops. A few abstract phrases could be fractionally more concrete, but they do not dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Figurative language is imaginative yet controlled (“constellation of sharp-edged fragments,” “chasing the strange stillness that had settled in his bones”), with no persistent mixed metaphors or redundancy. Summary passages are economical and purposeful, advancing time and pressure rather than stalling them. I see no major scaffolding, loops, or clarity issues that would impede momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“stars that belonged to no nation,” “the sound rippling across the settlement like water finding its level”) and high information density; most sentences do more than one job. Rhythm varies well between longer reflective lines and tighter scene sentences, maintaining momentum despite the quiet mode. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and coherent; it rarely tips into purple or redundancy. I see no significant scaffolding or loop artifacts, and the final paragraph lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and high information density: most sentences do double duty in image and theme. Metaphors (golden threads, upside-down world, lantern-like blossoms) are coherent and extended rather than scattered, mitigating any risk of purple prose. There are no obvious scaffold sentences, paraphrase loops, or line-level confusions that slow momentum. A few formulations get close to abstract summary, but they’re rare and don’t dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, dense but mostly purposeful imagery, and efficient integration of exposition into unfolding action. Phrases like “time felt like soil after rain, dense with possibility” show high-quality, concrete metaphor that clarifies rather than obscures. There are mild patches of conceptual repetition (maze/time architecture explained in similar terms across adjacent lines) that could be trimmed for even greater sharpness and momentum. Figurative language never becomes so stacked or mixed as to blur meaning, and the final cadence is clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with meaning—most sentences do at least two jobs (advancing action while carrying image or theme). Figurative language is frequent but generally clean and coherent; motifs like chains, keys, and seeds recur with purpose rather than as ornament. I see little paraphrase looping or scaffold; exposition about the regime is compact and integrated. A few lines lean toward abstraction or aphorism, but they do not materially blur clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense but efficient, with images doing multiple jobs at once (e.g., “auroras… whispered in frequencies she alone could perceive” establishes world, character, and method in one move). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and there’s no noticeable scaffold, synonym-churn, or repetitive cadence. Figurative language is inventive yet coherent; metaphors about sound, color, and structural failure all reinforce the central premise without clashing. Crucial beats—hearing the sound, making the choice—are dramatized in clear, strong sentences, giving the ending both clarity and emotional force.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, imagery is mostly sharp, and there’s little filler. Metaphors (light as honey, shadows as liquid pools) are vivid and coherent, and information density is high without feeling cramped.

The final paragraph lands cleanly with a charged image rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and image-rich, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character; phrases like “dust motes into constellations” and “glowed like captured sunset” are vivid without being overwrought. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and thematically aligned, and there’s little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic monotony. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final image of ice fragments as “messages carried toward distant reunions” elegantly recharges prior motifs. A few metaphors verge on explicit explanation rather than implication, but they don’t significantly harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and do multiple jobs (advancing plot while sketching inner state and atmosphere). Occasional metaphors and phrases (“ribs of some dying beast,” “weaponized secrets”) are effective, though the prose edges toward purple and abstract in the final thematic summation. There are no significant loops, artifacts, or clarity issues, and information density is appropriate for the length. Tighter pruning of on-the-nose thematic lines could lift the piece further.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and do multiple jobs (world-building, tone, and theme) without redundancy. Figurative language is rich but controlled; motifs like “ambered hush,” “marbled quiet,” and “captured sunlight” feel deliberate rather than decorative, and there are no mixed metaphors that blur sense. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the prose moves cleanly from beat to beat with maintained momentum despite its contemplative tone. A few elevated phrases flirt with purple but remain coherent and voice-justified.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are generally tight, clear, and varied, with several strong images (“patterns that looked like his own diagnostic readouts”) doing double duty for concept and atmosphere.

Figurative language is restrained and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. Rhythm supports a contemplative mood without dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences are generally tight, evocative, and purposeful, with strong image-driven lines like “a heart enclosed in parentheses” doing multiple kinds of work at once. Rhythm varies well between descriptive calm and moments of decision, and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Some phrases verge on the purple (“shimmered after the rain,” “resonant hush”) but they remain coherent and in-character for the story’s aesthetic. The line-level craft comfortably meets publication standards without obvious artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in rhythm, dense without sludge, and images are clean and specific (“caught the light like broken teeth,” “her hands moved with the certainty of roots finding water”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, reinforcing the garden/measurement motifs rather than spiraling into purple prose. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic tics dulling momentum. The final paragraph in particular braids image and concept efficiently, leaving a charged afterimage without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Figurative language is rich but mostly controlled, with motifs (twilight, warmth/ice, wings, facets) recurring rather than random metaphor churn. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and syntax varies enough to avoid monotony. A few lines flirt with purple or explanatory abstraction, but they don’t materially harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, tightly edited, and often do double duty with atmosphere and character insight. Figurative language (e.g., ink “bleeding into strange new patterns,” the opera house’s “truest form”) is apt and not overstacked, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding lines. Paragraphing supports momentum, moving smoothly from description to small turns of realization and choice. Any lushness feels intentional and controlled, with no figurative muddle touching the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and mostly economical, often doing double duty (e.g., frost as both environmental detail and thematic emblem). Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; information density is appropriate. A few phrases verge on the purple or self-conscious (“auroral sorrow,” “where truth lives”), but they don’t obscure meaning or the closure image. Overall, line-level craft supports rather than competes with story movement.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, concrete, and well-paced, with strong sensory choices (ceramic beads, dripping darkness, lunch pails, hammering water) and minimal redundancy. There is a slight tendency toward repeating the “weight of swallowed truth” concept in near-synonymous ways, but it doesn’t significantly slow momentum or obscure the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: almost every sentence does double duty in atmosphere and theme, with minimal redundancy and clean syntax. The figurative language is vivid and disciplined—“words dissolved into mulch,” “change unfolded like origami in reverse”—without sliding into muddled or mixed metaphors. There are very few scaffolding lines or paraphrase loops; momentum stays steady for a lyric piece, and the final paragraph lands with a precise, resonant cadence. A touch more variation in sentence architecture at the very end could sharpen impact, but that’s a fine-tuning note.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, good information density, and minimal scaffolding; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. A few metaphors border on the ornate (“beneath the hush of dreaming roots,” “ordinary magic breathed”) but stay coherent and do not pile up to the point of purple prose. There are no noticeable paraphrase loops or template cadences, and the rhythm of longer, descriptive sentences versus shorter emotional beats is well-judged. The final paragraphs in particular balance clarity and resonance without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, controlled, and largely free of scaffolding or loops; most sentences do at least two jobs (atmosphere + character, or worldbuilding + theme). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and rhythm varies enough to keep the paragraphs from feeling mechanical. There are a few slightly abstract or redundant phrases, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur the closure image. The final image—Miren touching the dragon’s claw, feeling Catherine’s echo—lands with clarity and economy.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, economical, and often do double duty (worldbuilding plus character plus theme). Figurative language (“transpose life into a new key,” “the best secrets were the ones everyone could read”) is apt and not overstacked. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the prose carries momentum despite its reflective bent. A few explanatory sentences verge on essayistic, but they don’t noticeably drag or obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and metaphors that are imaginative yet largely coherent and purposeful. The prose occasionally stacks abstractions (“hidden assumptions,” “conceptually possible”) in quick succession, which slightly cools momentum in a few lines. Repetition around ideas of stillness and control feels mostly intentional and pattern-building rather than scaffold. The final cadence is clean and image-driven, with no major artifacts or clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for image and theme; rhythm varies naturally, and paragraphing supports the accumulative structure. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and coherent (“endless corridor of light,” nautilus as score), avoiding mixed metaphors. There’s mild risk of purple prose, yet it rarely lapses into redundancy or obscurity, and I don’t see scaffold loops or template cadences dragging momentum. A touch more spareness in a few explanatory lines could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty with atmosphere and concept (“She existed between the drop and the ripple, suspended in that infinite moment before consequence arrived.”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with few mixed metaphors and no major purple-prose drag. There is minimal scaffolding or repetitive phrasing, and the final paragraph lands cleanly on a charged, concrete image. A handful of abstract nouns (“labyrinth of self,” “probability itself”) slightly thin immediacy in spots but don’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly free of redundancy, with several strong lines (“a talisman against the emotional numbness that had settled over him like sediment”) doing double duty for mood and characterization. Figurative language is present but not overwrought, and sentence structures vary enough to maintain momentum in a lyrical mode. There are a few tendencies toward abstract summary or tidy phrasing (“a victory carved from absence,” “quiet certainty”) that feel more essayistic than lived, but they don’t seriously obscure clarity or dull the ending. Line-level craft is solidly publishable with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms, clean syntax, and high information density—most lines do double duty for setting, character, or tension. Figurative language (“dusk painted the sky lavender and gold,” “layered tranquility”) is selective and thematically aligned, not purple or over-stacked. There are no obvious scaffold sentences, repetition loops, or confusing metaphors, and technical terms are used lightly and plausibly. A few phrases are slightly ornate, but they don’t impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and image-rich, with few wasted sentences; most lines do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Metaphors around light, color, and crystal are coherent and patterned rather than haphazard, and the rhythm varies well between description and interiority. There is a mild risk of lushness, but it doesn’t swell into opacity or redundancy, and pivotal beats (the blooming light, the grief) remain clear. I see no significant loops or scaffolding that sap momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, characterization, theme) with good rhythm and minimal scaffolding, and the figurative language is mostly precise and integrated. Images like “time leaked at the edges” and “starlight fell in visible threads” are striking without becoming muddled. There is some drift into abstraction and slight repetition of phrasing around the beings’ impact and Marcus’s role, especially near the end, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum or blur meaning. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only light tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that usually do double duty for setting and emotion. There are no meaningful loops or scaffolding sentences; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or thematic pattern. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and well-controlled (“beauty persisted in broken form,” “air itself had grown too tired to carry music”) and never obscures cause/effect or the closure image. The rhythm slows appropriately at the ending, letting the bowl-passing and fruit-drop land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, purposeful, and often do double duty (worldbuilding + theme, or image + interiority). Figurative language around amber, static, and emotion is coherent and not overstacked; no major mixed metaphors or loops. There is some conceptual density near the end, but it doesn’t obscure action or closure. No noticeable scaffolding, synonym churn, or rhythm artifacts undercut momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences are clear, well-paced, and mostly economical, with a few striking images (“starlight pooled like spilled milk,” “thick with meaning”) that do multiple jobs at once. There’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym-churn, and rhythm varies enough to keep the ear engaged. A few phrases feel familiar or slightly abstracted (“the worth of recognition”), and some lines paraphrase theme rather than embedding it in image. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready, if not formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density and images that generally pull double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“fruit that sang in frequencies beyond the murmur of lost languages”). Sentence rhythm varies well and keeps momentum despite the reflective, lyric mode. A few metaphors and abstractions (e.g., “luminescent longing”) flirt with purple but stay coherent and do not obscure action or causality. There is little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic template-ing that would drag the line-level craft down.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and story. Figurative language (“silk made of memory,” “time limped rather than flowed”) is vivid and largely well-judged, rarely crossing into purple or redundancy. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding sentences, or muddled metaphors, and the final paragraph lands cleanly without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally efficient while carrying layered work (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme often cohabit a single line), and figurative language is vivid without lapsing into muddle. The prose avoids obvious loops or scaffolding and maintains momentum even during reflective moments. Occasionally the density of abstractions (axioms, topology, quantum uncertainty) piles up within a sentence, but clarity survives and the pattern feels intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, doing multiple jobs at once (advancing action, setting, and theme). Figurative language (“sapphire hush,” “ran like veins”) is consistent and not overstacked, and there are few if any true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. A faint tendency toward sentimental diction in the closing stretch (“finally achieved visibility,” “belonging”) slightly softens the impact compared to a more image-led ending. Overall, though, the prose is polished and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences are clear, well-shaped, and do multiple jobs at once (advancing time, character, and setting together) with very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is measured and concrete (e.g., “storms as conversations”), avoiding purple excess while retaining lyric lift. Paragraphing supports momentum; each block brings new information or reweights prior material, so there’s minimal redundancy drag. The prose could push risk slightly further in its most charged moments, but at this level it’s already publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is tight, with strong image density (“trails left by last night's rain, branching like neurons across the mudflats”) and minimal scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every line carries either atmosphere, character, or theme. Metaphors are generally clean and thematically resonant (water as memory, brooch as “trapped sun”) without stacking to the point of muddle. Rhythm varies well between descriptive expansiveness and shorter, declarative insights, maintaining momentum despite the reflective bent. A few thematic clarifications could be slightly compressed or left to inference, but line-level craft is already at a high literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding. Imagery like “bright darkness” and “shadows grew teeth” is striking and largely coherent with the world’s logic. There is some risk of ornament overload—abstract phrases such as “reality's substrate” and repeated “everyday magic” drift toward thematic labeling rather than scene pressure. Still, clarity holds, there are no noticeable loops or template cadences, and the final lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and efficient, with high information density—lines often carry setting, emotion, and theme simultaneously (“a monument to empty spaces, to navigated absences”). Figurative language is apt and not over-stacked; there’s no evident synonym churn or scaffolding, and momentum never stalls. The opening and closing sentences are particularly well-tuned, bookending the piece with charged images. There’s still a tiny hint of safety in diction (no truly surprising turns of phrase), which keeps it just shy of the rare 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language (cracks as arrows, station as cathedral, truths calcified into architecture) is vivid and coherent with the metaphysical conceit. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax remains clear even in the most lyrical passages. The only arguable risk is a high metaphor density, but it never tangles sense or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level writing is clean, largely free of redundancy, and uses metaphor and imagery with restraint and clarity. Sentences generally do more than one job—advancing plot, revealing character, and sustaining atmosphere simultaneously. There are no noticeable cadence templates or scaffold sentences that sap momentum, and the final image lands with a controlled, lyrical rhythm. A few phrases verge on familiar (“sculpt space for reflection,” “ancient travelers”), but they don’t significantly dull the prose’s effectiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level writing is polished, rhythmic, and dense without becoming incoherent: metaphors of prisms, serpents, mutinies, and paper-folding reality knit into an integrated texture. Sentences typically do more than one job—advancing action, deepening setting, and revealing emotion simultaneously—and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. Some images verge on purple or familiar SF lyricism (“understanding blooming like poison,” “hurt to perceive”), but they don’t blur sense or stall momentum. Syntax and paragraphing support the rising pressure into the storm’s peak and the quiet drop into the aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and densely informative without purple overload. Metaphors like “deathly vitality” and “pure equation” are apt and not overstacked, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. The prose maintains momentum even while introducing backstory and thematic framing. I see no significant artifacts, loops, or clarity issues that blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with imagery that is consistently coherent and purposeful (“each tree a century compressed into knee-height,” “The blossoms remember being large”). The metaphoric texture is rich without tipping into muddle or redundancy, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The rhythm supports the quiet, accumulative structure, breathing where it needs to without losing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lean yet evocative, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character while maintaining clarity and forward movement. Metaphors (ghost among the living, containers as monuments to replacement, memory’s texture) are coherent and thematically aligned without crowding each other. There is minimal redundancy and no significant scaffold or cadence artifact; rhythm modulates well between summary and scene. Line-level execution is near publication-ready with only a few slightly on-the-nose transitions (“The day she found the poison bottle label changed everything”) that don’t materially blunt the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, well-chosen concrete nouns, and figurative language that mostly clarifies rather than obscures. The prose carries high information density, with very little scaffolding or redundancy, and momentum never stalls despite the reflective emphasis. A few lines tilt toward overt abstraction or slogan (“An ephemeral compass didn’t point to coordinates. It pointed to understanding.”), which slightly blunts the otherwise sharp imagery. Overall, though, the piece would read as polished and publication-ready with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, dense with information, and largely free of scaffolding or loops; almost every sentence advances setting, character, or stakes. Metaphoric language (barnacles, hurricane, being “swallowed”) is apt and not overstacked, and there is no noticeable template cadence. Paragraphing is purposeful and momentum is maintained even through reflective passages. I see no artifacts that obscure clarity or dull the closure; the final lines land with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is controlled and economical for its density: most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and apt, with only a few borderline-purple constructions (“condemned cathedral of stone,” “smaller than a star, infinite in meaning”) that risk overstatement. There are no evident loops, scaffolding, or clarity issues, and the closing image is sharp despite the abstract tilt of the final clause. Overall, it’s polished, publishable line work with minor tendencies toward overt prettiness.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, fluid, and purposeful, and many carry dual loads of atmosphere and information. Repetition is mostly functional, though a few phrases (“heartfelt artisan,” “heartfelt precision,” “making the broken world whole”) edge toward cliché or scaffolding. There’s little figurative muddle; metaphors like “railway bones” and “cathedral silence” feel apt and controlled. Minor telling intrusions slightly dull momentum but do not seriously obscure causality or the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, exposition is efficiently folded into scene, and most lines do double duty for character and atmosphere. Figurative language (“ice older than cartography itself,” “patterns within patterns”) is controlled and coherent with the story’s conceptual frame. There are no obvious loops, purple patches, or clarity breaks, and the final paragraph lands cleanly. The prose is excellent but not so stylistically distinctive as to push into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and purposeful, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and story. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or filler constructions. Information density is high without feeling rushed, and the transitions between summary and scene are smooth. With only slight tightening of a couple of explanatory phrases, this would meet elite-line standards.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally lean, clear, and well-rhythmed, with effective images (“kelp like funeral shrouds,” “crystal loneliness”) and good sentence-level propulsion. There are a few familiar formulations and paired abstractions (“too dangerous to study—too beautiful to ignore, too consuming to safely hold”) that feel slightly generic. Exposition is efficiently embedded, and there are no major loops, muddled metaphors, or line-level artifacts that drag momentum. The craft is strong and publishable but falls just short of the startling precision and freshness that would push it into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, and imagery such as “walls thick with salt and silence” and “skeleton of faith” is vivid without becoming overwrought. Most sentences do double duty, advancing scene and atmosphere together, with little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned; no mixed metaphors or clotted patches cloud the climax. The prose is polished enough for high-level publication with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, with rich but controlled figurative language (“temperature dropped like a stone into dark water,” “wedding gown the color of cremation smoke”) that advances mood and worldbuilding. Sentence rhythm and paragraphing support momentum, and there is little redundancy or scaffolding. A few phrases edge toward purple or abstract (“resonant awakenings” as a term, “lovingly venomous mistakes”) but they do not significantly blur clarity or undercut closure. Information density and clarity at the climax remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (world, character, and theme) without padding, and the rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. Imagery is vivid yet mostly disciplined, with only a few abstract phrases (“grammar of possibility”) that skate toward conceptual rather than sensory, but they don’t obscure meaning. There’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or metaphor muddle, and the final image is precise and strong. Overall, line-level craft is very close to elite-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled and clean, with varied sentence rhythms and efficient paragraphs that carry both image and meaning. Metaphors (roots as “careful fingers,” stones as prayers) are apt and not overstacked, and there’s little redundancy or filler. A slight tendency toward gentle sentiment in the final lines and a few familiar turns of phrase keep this in the strong-but-not-transcendent range.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is controlled and economical, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language (e.g., “messages deserved the weight of paper”) is apt and not over-stacked, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding redundancies. Rhythm varies nicely between longer reflective lines and tighter, concrete actions around the mail slot. A few phrases brush the edge of ornamentation, but they don’t obscure clarity or dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, lean, and purposeful, often doing double duty for setting, character, and stakes (“a galaxy chart disguised as decorative nonsense”). Figurative language is selective and coherent, avoiding purple excess while still offering memorable images (the flame as carrier, threads as routes and alliances). There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum builds naturally toward the final door-knock. The prose is not quite in the showiest top tier, but it is clean, controlled, and publication-ready as is.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clear, and typically do more than one job (advancing action while sustaining atmosphere). Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and legible, with few mixed metaphors; the shard’s history and the condensation messages are particularly effective images. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the final line returns to the rain motif in a controlled way. The prose occasionally nudges toward the familiar or slightly purple, but it doesn’t seriously impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is largely strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that usually do double duty (e.g., coral as both object and metaphor for convoluted discourse). There are no significant loops or scaffolding lines, and causality/momentum remain clear even during reflective passages. Some metaphors and abstractions (“lotus-hearted knowledge,” “truth with a specific shape”) edge toward the purple, and figurative density is high, but coherence is maintained. Tightening two or three slightly ornate phrases would sharpen an already polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: metaphors are coherent (“cracked like exposed film”), sentences carry multiple loads (world, character, theme), and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition that doesn’t serve motif. The prose maintains clarity despite its lyric density, and momentum doesn’t stall even in reflective passages because each image pushes the reconsideration of joy and light forward. Fog/light imagery recurs but avoids cliché via specific phrasing and variation. I see no notable syntactic artifacts or figurative muddle touching the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is tight: sentences are well-shaped, varied, and information-dense, nearly all doing multiple jobs (advancing plot, character, and atmosphere together). Figurative language is selective and apt, with few if any mixed metaphors or purple patches, and there’s minimal visible scaffolding or repetition. A handful of abstract summary lines near the end slightly dilute immediacy, but they don’t materially harm momentum or closure. For most elite venues, this is already in publishable range with only marginal tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are generally tight, varied, and information-dense; most lines do double duty for world, character, and mood. Recurrent metaphors of planting, blooming, and codes are coherent and not overstacked, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase. A few phrases lean toward slightly purple (“warp themselves into shapes that don’t fit their boxes,” “bending through the city's forgotten spaces like light through flawed glass”), but they’re clear and thematically aligned rather than muddling sense. The prose has good momentum for a largely expository scene.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding and theme, or character and atmosphere), and the rhythm reads smoothly aloud. Figurative language is dense but usually coherent and patterned rather than purple, with very few mixed or strained metaphors. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; the piece maintains momentum despite being reflective. The overall lushness may slightly risk saturation for some readers, but it doesn’t materially obscure clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without bloating, and metaphors are coherent and thematically apt. There is some density of figurative language, but it remains legible and rarely feels like purple excess; rhythms modulate to support key beats (the cracked note, the decision not to repair). Redundancy is minimal, with only occasional conceptual overlap around extinction and forgetting. Both opening and closing lines work as charged, image-based anchors that echo each other.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without bloat. Metaphors like “symphonies of truth” and “interconnected promises” are coherent and sustained rather than scattered ornaments. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and rhythm adapts to scene needs, slowing for the writing process and tightening around Marcus’s reading. A few adjective clusters (“carefully reckless abandon,” “cautious exuberance”) flirt with lushness but stay controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, character, theme) without obvious redundancy, and metaphors are generally coherent and evocative. The volcano-as-lung motif and the chain as moral-weight device are well sustained. There is a mild density of figurative language (“encrypted compassion,” “trembled through her like voltage,” “dappled resolve”) that verges on purple in places but rarely muddies meaning. Trimming a few abstracted generalizations near the end would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, economical, and rhythmically varied, with most sentences doing double duty (advancing both atmosphere and character). Imagery such as dust motes as a “miniature galaxy” or trust as “a pigeon released into storm clouds” is vivid and controlled rather than overstacked. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each paragraph adds new nuance or pressure. The line-level work is nearly publication-ready as-is, with only very minor risk of slight over-lyricism in spots.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, theme) with minimal redundancy, and the rhythm on the page is varied and purposeful. Figurative language (“refracting nothing into everything,” “distributed through [the maze]”) is mostly fresh and coherent, with only occasional hints of abstraction that don’t harm clarity. There are no evident scaffold sentences or synonym loops, and the closure image (writing PRESNT, the terrace shimmering, the oak as a “map home”) is clean and potent. The density of metaphor skirts purple once or twice but remains controlled and intelligible.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally concise yet rich, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (e.g., the architecture responding to ancient starlight filtered through sea). Figurative language is present but not stacked to the point of purple prose, and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or filler scaffolds. Line-level clarity is high; action and perception track cleanly, and the final lines land with a clear, charged image. Minor density spikes in modifiers don’t materially slow momentum or obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: most lines carry more than one job (worldbuilding and emotion, or image and concept) and avoid redundancy; figurative language is vivid but generally not overwrought. Phrases like “smooth as memory itself” and “dissolved like sugar in water” are familiar but well-placed, with only occasional near-echoes of concept (“unmade,” “paths,” “pruned”) that skirt repetition without sinking momentum. The prose maintains clarity even during abstract explanation, and the closing paragraph lands with a clean, memorable image.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong image economy (“constellation-bright LEDs,” “shark-eyed hustler”) and very little scaffolding or repetition; most sentences do at least two jobs. Figurative language is vivid but not overstacked, and syntax modulates to match shifts between atmospheric description and tighter exchanges over the chessboard. Information is delivered cleanly without exposition dumps, and the final paragraph’s rhythm lands with a satisfying cadence. Any slight neatness in phrasing is more stylistic choice than artifact, and it doesn’t blunt momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, densely meaningful, and mostly avoid redundancy, with imagery doing double work for setting and theme. A few phrases edge toward lushness for its own sake, but metaphor chains remain coherent and readable, and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts. Rhythm and paragraphing support the accumulative, incantatory feel of the dance.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished, with strong images (“mist still clung to the water like breath on glass”) and generally efficient sentences that carry more than one function (setting plus psychology plus theme). A few lines verge on explicit abstraction or repetition (“ordinary magic of paying attention,” “grammar of the mundane”), but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure sense. Rhythm is varied and there are no notable scaffolds or loops. It’s very good prose, a notch below the absolute sharpest minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence-level craft is generally precise and economical, with many lines doing double duty for mood and characterization. Metaphors are mostly apt and consistent (burn scars as landscape, the crack as “the place where light got in”), and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. Some phrases lean into abstraction or familiar turns (“translate pain into a universal language,” “find meaning in the pattern of his choices”), slightly dulling the freshest textures. Momentum holds well despite a reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose offers strong rhythm, high information density, and mostly clean, unfussy syntax; images like “wind through canvas” and “grotto polished by countless tides” feel apt and controlled. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to become purple or confusing, and there are no evident paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences. Action and description are woven together without stalling momentum, and the final lines land with a clear, charged image. Occasional abstract formulations (“equations for hope,” “measure its beauty”) slightly flatten texture compared to the best lines.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and efficient: most sentences do double duty by advancing scene, worldbuilding, and interiority simultaneously. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (ivy as nervous system, buildings dreaming forward) rather than piled on; there are no evident loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic monotony. Pacing remains smooth despite the reflective mode; exposition folds naturally into action (e.g., learning about her profession through her present work, not infodumps). Line-level work fully supports the closure image without obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are clear, and most metaphors (“each droplet…becoming a tiny world of possibility”) are precise and thematically loaded. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to blur sense or pace; it generally does more than one job. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the prose moves forward without getting stuck in loops. A hair more restraint or an occasional plainer beat under peak moments might sharpen contrast, but the current execution is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and largely efficient metaphor (“layers of violence compressed into sediment”; “each name a small death rehearsed”). Sentences tend to do double duty—advancing both scene and theme—and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundancy. Imagery is frequent but not so stacked as to turn purple, and syntax varies smoothly with the emotional load. A few meta-analytic sentences could be slightly tightened, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences advance character, world, and theme simultaneously, and figurative language is targeted rather than piled. Metaphors (egg “dense as grief,” the land as map, the philanthropist “engineering water scarcity”) are consistent in register and support clarity rather than obscuring it. There are no evident scaffold sentences, synonym loops, or mechanical cadences undermining momentum, and the final paragraph lands on a clean, charged image. A few phrases edge toward the lyrical (“deliberate ruin, now washing clean”) but they’re earned by prior setup and don’t feel overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with good rhythm, vivid metaphors, and efficient integration of backstory into present action. There is some tendency toward purple density—multiple figurative layers (“living sculpture,” “beautiful corpse,” “harvest of echoes”) in close succession—that could be pared for maximal impact. Sentences nearly always advance either plot, character, or atmosphere; there is little outright scaffolding or repetition. No major line-level artifacts interfere with clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is clean: syntax is varied, grammar solid, and most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing scene, character, and theme together). There’s minimal redundancy and no major figurative muddle; metaphors like the radar dome’s original function are clear and purposeful. A few spots veer into abstract summary (“He’d congratulated himself…”; “Ethical storytelling wasn’t about…”) where a more concrete beat could sharpen momentum. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready with only light tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and controlled, with high information density—most sentences do double duty in image and concept. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and purposeful (“caught the thin air like a question mark,” “living petals,” “wandering garden in the sky”) without drifting into muddle. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or clunky transitions; momentum is steady despite the reflective mode. The only minor limitation is that the lyricism is relatively uniform, with few sharp textural shifts to mark the story’s internal peak.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and image-rich, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and action at once). Metaphors (“bronze remembered everything it had ever been”) are strong and coherent, and there’s minimal repetition or scaffolding. The density of figurative language skirts purple in places, but it rarely muddies clarity or momentum and fits the contemplative pace. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to maintain a smooth read.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, interiority, and theme) with relatively little padding, and metaphors are generally apt and fresh. There are a few repetitions and slightly lush moments (“precisely playful” recurs; the last paragraphs edge toward abstraction), but they don’t significantly blur clarity or pacing. Syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm lively, and key images land cleanly. Overall, it’s publishable prose with only minor tightening needed to hit the very top echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences are largely clean, varied, and purposeful; most carry more than one job (character, mood, and world-building at once) without padding. Figurative language is controlled and thematically aligned (harmony, covenant, bridge across millennia) rather than piled on, and there are no major clarity or rhythm stumbles. There is some mild repetition of key abstractions (“encrypted devotion,” “covenant with the unknown”) and a few slightly ornate turns, but they don’t stall momentum. Line-level craft is solid and publishable, if not yet razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, generally concise, and pull multiple weights (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, with the standout extended metaphor of the music box carrying much of the load. Expository lines about the facility and resentment-as-fuel skate close to abstraction but remain clear and don’t bog momentum. There are no visible loops, mixed metaphors, or rhythm artifacts that interfere with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—many sentences simultaneously build world, mood, and character, as in “like memories finding their proper sequence.” Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and thematically unified around glass, frost, and boundaries, avoiding mixed-metaphor muddle. Momentum is maintained; description is woven into action rather than stalling it, and there’s little to no obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. A few lines approach the edge of ornamentation, but they do not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clean, controlled, and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for scene and theme (“machines see with precision, but hands see with mercy”). Imagery is coherent and not over-stacked; motifs (blossoms, quartz, ribbon) recur with purpose rather than decorative excess. There are few, if any, scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and action remains clear. The only drag on peak elegance is some sentimentality and explicit “wisdom” phrasing that slightly blunts the otherwise sharp line-level effect.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and high information density—most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus interiority, or theme plus image). Figurative language is generally fresh and legible (“loam of crushed starlight and soil,” “water spiraling up a drain”) and rarely feels overstacked. There are minor tendencies toward abstraction (“forbidden knowledge,” “temples of knowing”) that could be grounded in more concrete texture, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure meaning. No major loops, scaffolding, or grammatical slips are evident.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense but generally efficient: many sentences carry worldbuilding, tone, and character simultaneously without padding. Figurative language (“each corridor hummed with an unheard symphony…”, “shelves branching like neural pathways”) is coherent and supports the central conceit rather than drifting into mixed metaphors. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding, and rhythm varies well across descriptive and climactic moments. In a few spots the abstract phrasing could be trimmed for sharper immediacy, but line-level craft is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with vivid metaphors (“fog roll across the bay like erasing fingers”) that mostly land cleanly and do multiple jobs at once. Sentence rhythm varies, and there are no evident loops, scaffolding, or mechanical cadences that stall momentum. A few formulations edge toward purple, yet they remain legible and aligned with the story’s lyric intent, including at the climax. The final sentences are particularly strong in recharging earlier images (the card, the ship, the “garden”) without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is clean and fluent, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density—most sentences advance both atmosphere and concept. Images like “the clear complexity of truth finally arranged into its proper configuration” mesh content and style effectively. There is some lexical repetition around “reconfiguring/configuration” and a few explanatory sentences that restate ideas the scene already implies, slightly reducing sharpness. Overall, though, the prose is publication-ready with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and function. Metaphors are precise and coherent (“cracks radiated like lightning, like river deltas”) without over-accumulating into purple prose. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the final images land clearly and musically. The prose rarely takes true formal risks, which keeps it from the very top band but also ensures clarity and momentum never suffer.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and generally tight, with many lines doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once. Images like “hope scattered on thistle-down” and “the world hummed around her, glass-song and thistle-hope” are vivid and coherent with the story’s texture. There is some density of metaphor, but it remains legible and doesn’t create figurative muddle or repetition loops. Line-level craft is close to publication-ready, needing only minor trimming of the most decorative flourishes.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and controlled, with varied sentence rhythms and many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“weather that no longer merely passed but accumulated, becoming architecture”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically aligned (architecture, sculpture, bridges), and it rarely obscures basic sense. There are minor tendencies toward purple density in spots and a few near-redundant formulations, yet they don’t seriously drag momentum or blur the closure image. Information density and clarity remain high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with strong verbs, specific nouns, and images that carry multiple jobs (primrose, ash, spirals) without sliding into purple. Sentence rhythm varies well, pacing the approach, initiation, and emotional crest. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line advances character, setting, or thematic pressure. A couple of high-level abstractions (“geometry of motion, the mathematics of beauty”) flirt with generality but stay anchored enough in his craft not to drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and rich in concrete images; most sentences do double duty advancing scene and atmosphere. Figurative language (e.g., accusations “hanging in the salt-thick air”) generally enhances rather than obscures, and there’s little scaffold or redundancy. A few phrases (“discover the texture of time itself”) edge toward poetic abstraction and could be tightened or grounded, but they do not blur causality or dull the closure. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor opportunities for paring back ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rich and largely precise, with strong images (“concrete wombs,” “silence after lies,” “secrets cost fortunes and discretion gleamed like polished brass”) and good rhythmic variety. Sentences often do double duty—advancing worldbuilding, theme, and emotion simultaneously—without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and purposeful; the “stretching-contracting sky” motif reinforces the character’s inner state. Occasional abstraction and phrase repetition (“spaces so carefully curated with quiet”) are minor and don’t significantly dull momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and efficient, with images like “vaulting hush” and “suspended in liquid color” achieving a strong sensory effect. Description and action interweave smoothly without bogging down momentum, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. At times the figurative language edges toward the purple and thematic statements toward the abstract, but clarity is never sacrificed. Line-level craft is solidly publishable, if not yet startlingly precise.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“fiber-optic threads cascading,” “fruit that looked like crystallized stars”) and good information density; most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character). Figurative language is present but not so stacked as to blur sense, and there are few if any redundancy loops or scaffolding artifacts. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum despite a descriptive emphasis. A touch more compression around thematic statements and a slightly sharper edge to the action sequences would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are well-shaped, images are coherent, and the prose balances rhythm with clarity. Figurative language is frequent but usually purposeful and internally consistent, reinforcing the burn/ash/oxygen motif rather than spiraling into mixed metaphors. There is some tendency toward elevated, abstract phrasing (“obligations disguised as love,” “loaded emptiness”), but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum or obscure sense. The final paragraphs land cleanly, with the last line’s simplicity (“In the loaded silence, that was enough”) providing a good counterweight to prior lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, rhythmic, and largely economical given the density of ideas, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and legible, and there are few if any genuine loops or scaffolding phrases. Some phrases (“pressure into diamonds,” “between what is and what could be”) recur in ways that feel slightly slogan-like, nudging toward abstraction rather than sharpening the moment. Overall, though, clarity and momentum are maintained, and the closing image of the quantum diamond in her pocket lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, mostly lean, and rhythmically varied, with strong line-level images (“first yawn of evening,” “a sound like time itself being measured and held accountable”). Description and interiority are integrated without obvious scaffolding or repetitive loops, and grammar/punctuation are precise. At times the language edges toward the lush, but it remains controlled and purposeful rather than purple or overwrought. Information density is good: nearly every sentence advances mood, character, or situation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, interiority) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythm varies well. Figurative language is rich but generally coherent and thematically aligned (strings, stages, curtains closing), avoiding purple muddle. Occasional repetition (“shivering bliss”) reads as deliberate motif rather than accident. There’s minimal excess; most lines advance either pressure or atmosphere with good information density.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, well-paced, and do multiple jobs (advancing plot, revealing character, building atmosphere). Figurative language is selective and apt (“accidental archives,” “intersection of loss and survival”), without drifting into purple or mixed metaphors. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; each paragraph moves the story forward. A couple of phrases are slightly abstract (“faithful and enormous” love) but they don’t materially blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, with strong images (“ghost-streets emerge from the emulsion like memories surfacing”) and good information density—most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Rhythm varies cleanly, and there are few, if any, syntactic or lexical artifacts, with minimal redundancy. A couple of lines tip toward overt abstraction (“tyranny of indifference,” “carefully constructed consensus reality”), but they don’t significantly bog momentum or blur sense. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor potential trims.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally well-shaped, varied, and information-dense, with few if any genuine scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically aligned, so it enriches rather than muddies the images. There is a mild risk of over-lushness in places, yet clarity and momentum never significantly suffer, including at the closure beat. Overall, this is polished prose that could be published with minimal line edits.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence rhythms and a high density of meaningful images (“mandalas of forgotten grains and extinct flowers,” “the pleasure was green and ancient”). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, supporting mood rather than obscuring sense. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and theme. A few phrases (“moonstone cabochon dust speck,” “hummed with mossy delight”) flirt with decorative excess but don’t materially harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, clear, and dense with information, and description usually does double duty for mood and meaning. There is little redundancy or scaffolding, and the prose avoids obvious clichés. A few lines edge toward aphorism or overt abstraction, especially in the closing thematic statements, but they don’t seriously obscure sense or momentum. Overall, rhythm and clarity are strong enough for near-ready publication.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: most lines do double duty, advancing scene while reinforcing atmosphere or theme, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language (“the weight of a name,” “luminous regret,” “the shape her absence had carved into the world”) is mostly precise and coherent with the story’s logic. A few constructions flirt with abstraction, but they remain anchored enough in concrete context not to feel purple or obscure. The final paragraph, particularly the candle image, offers a clean, resonant cadence without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, few if any redundant sentences, and metaphors that mostly feel apt and grounded (“luminous ache,” “stone’s memory,” the warped harp’s crooked notes). The prose leans lush but stops short of purple; syntax and paragraphing keep momentum through the central confession and release. There are no obvious scaffolding loops or awkward constructions, and the final cadence lands cleanly. A touch more spareness at one or two descriptive moments could further sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: vivid but controlled imagery, varied syntax, and high information density with very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (e.g., “pain became language,” “calculations beautiful instead of terrible”) is coherent and thematically aligned rather than ornamental. Transitions between backstory and present are smooth and do not stall momentum. There are no noticeable grammatical or clarity issues, and the opening and closing lines both land with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is polished: concrete images (“bottled starlight,” “crystallized memories,” “compasses that pointed toward lost loves”) do double duty for worldbuilding and theme. There’s high information density with little scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and the syntax varies enough to avoid monotony. A few lines verge on explanatory (“These were the anchors of intuition her grandmother had taught her to seek”), tipping from image into gloss, which slightly softens the ending’s impact. Overall, momentum and clarity remain strong, with no major artifacts or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clear, controlled, and mostly economical, with several strong images (“her form wavering like heat shimmer,” “walls that exhaled must”). Sentences generally do more than one job—advancing action while building atmosphere—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The last paragraph leans into abstract phrasing (“cracks in the façade needed exploring, not sealing”) and near-platitudes that feel less sharp than the earlier concrete writing. Still, there are no major loops or artifacts, and momentum is maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences advance both image and theme—and very few redundancies. Metaphors tend to be aligned (orchard/library, frost as near-language), and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. There is mild purple/epigrammatic tilt in a few lines, especially the final sentence and some thematic declarations, which slightly blunts subtlety. Still, there are no major artifacts or muddles; the line-level craft is nearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences have musical variety, images are vivid, and most metaphors are coherent and mutually reinforcing (baroque corridors as “frozen music,” time-light as “golden pollen”). Information density is high without feeling cluttered, and there’s minimal redundancy. The prose occasionally edges toward over-explanation of already-embedded ideas, but not enough to stall momentum. No significant artifacts, loops, or figurative muddles mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is consistently clear, concise for its lyricism, and rich in purposeful imagery (“sound folded back upon itself in endless, shimmering echoes” is emblematic). Sentences do multiple jobs—advancing plot, character, and atmosphere—without falling into obvious repetition or scaffolding. There is a touch of purple in stacked abstractions (e.g., “tinkersong wonder,” “covenant of rust,” “midnight’s essence”), but they remain coherent and on-theme rather than muddling the sense. Line-level control is strong enough for immediate publishability in many venues.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (scene-setting, character, theme) with little scaffolding or redundancy, and rhythm varies well. Figurative language is vivid but controlled, avoiding mixed metaphors or opacity; phrases like “hinged awakenings” and “a secret kept in stone” feel precise rather than purple. There are no noticeable loops, syntactic tics, or clarity issues, and both opening and closing lines are strong anchors. The only minor limitation is a fairly uniform lyrical register, which could benefit from a touch more textural contrast as tension peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally lean, vivid, and purposeful, with strong images (“granite blocks slick with spray,” “twisted chambers catching water and light”) doing multiple jobs at once. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not excessive for this lyric mode. There are a few abstract or essayistic lines near the end that flatten momentum slightly, yet they don’t obscure sense or closure. No major loops, scaffolding, or syntactic artifacts interfere with reading.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and economical, often doing double duty for character, setting, and theme in a single line (“glass panels catching the late afternoon light like captured fire”). Sentence rhythms vary, and there is little scaffolding or redundancy. A few moments lean toward purple or slightly repetitive phrasing (e.g., the doubled “hidden layers of etched glass in a cathedral window”), which nudges the piece away from absolute sharpness. Still, clarity and momentum are never in doubt, and the closing paragraph lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery and generally efficient sentences that each carry atmosphere or character as well as information. There is some density of metaphor (“retrocognitively trapped,” “bitter as salt,” “searing reverie”) but it stops short of purple and does not obscure clarity or momentum. No obvious loops or scaffolding artifacts mar the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are clean, syntactically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“blueprints, she realized, or memories of blueprints”). Figurative language is consistent in register and generally precise; metaphors of architecture, memory, and alchemy form a coherent network rather than a jumble. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffold, and the prose maintains momentum despite its reflective bent. A slight tendency to lean on abstract nouns (“essence,” “civilization,” “methodology”) keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are specific, metaphors are apt and not overstacked, and there’s very little redundancy or scaffolding. The prose balances density with clarity, allowing complex concepts (archiving emotional grooves in wax shavings) to remain legible. Rhythm varies well between long, flowing descriptions and tighter, impactful sentences at turning points (the prophecy line, the final charge). A few phrases verge on ornate, but they support rather than smother momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and generally do multiple jobs at once; metaphors like “tasted like metal and memory” and “furiously tranquil” are striking yet coherent. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to become purple or muddled, and there are few if any paraphrase loops. Information flow is clear, with no significant scaffold or filler lines dulling momentum. A small portion of the explanatory entropy/time passages feels slightly more telling than showing, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, image-rich, and purposeful; sentences often carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, character, and mood) without bloat. Variations in sentence length and paragraphing keep momentum, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding that could be easily cut. Figurative language (e.g., “solstice hush,” “atmospheric rivers collided”) remains coherent and supports both mood and plot. A couple of abstract or slightly on-the-nose phrases aside, the line-level craft supports rather than competes with the story’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“the universe fall upward into light”) and efficient, multi-function sentences that build atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Information density is high and scaffolding minimal, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Some phrases flirt with the abstract or slightly purple, and a few ideas are repeated in slightly different guises, but these don’t materially slow momentum or muddy the closure image. Overall, line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally tight and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for setting and theme (e.g., “their mouths moving in silent testimony to words they'd never spoken in life”). There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; the paragraphs move the story forward rather than circling. A few lines veer toward abstract summary or slogan (“The weight of unspoken words had followed them past death”), but they don’t seriously muddy clarity or pacing. The overall rhythm and syntax are smooth enough to meet a high-bar literary standard, even if they occasionally lean into familiar lyrical phrasings.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with meaning without tipping into purple excess. Most sentences do at least two jobs—advancing setting and theme, or character and world-building simultaneously. There is little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or metaphor muddle; images are clear and internally consistent. A slight tendency to explicate the theme in dialogue trims the edge off what could be even more incisive line-level work, but craft remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length, imagery is usually precise, and most lines pull double duty (advancing scene while carrying theme). Figurative language (“final curtain dissipate into mist,” “symphony of ripples”) is frequent but largely coherent and voice-justified; it doesn’t obscure action. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic tics that drag momentum. The only restraint on a higher score is a mild density of abstract, quasi-spiritual phrasing near the end, which slightly blunts the sharpness of prior concrete images.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, economical, and often striking (“pillars of living limestone that breathed moisture,” “copper wire gleamed in the branches like veins carrying intention rather than blood”), with good sentence variety and high information density. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and figurative language is purposeful rather than piled on. A few explanatory sentences could be tightened, and the occasional thematic aphorism feels slightly more like thesis than image, but momentum and clarity remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, character, theme) with minimal redundancy, and there’s no obvious scaffold or synonym-churn. Figurative language is selective and consistent (amber, footprints, bells, rain), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. Syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm supple, and key moments are given clean, uncluttered phrasing (“Outside, the rain continued its quiet music against stone”). Minor abstraction in a few thematic lines doesn’t materially dull momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with high information density: most sentences carry setting, character, and theme simultaneously (“this confined space that somehow contained infinity” is economical and precise). Figurative language is controlled and coherent; the repeated battlefield/garden and death/life contrasts never tip into overwrought metaphor. Sentence rhythm varies and keeps momentum without rushing the quiet mood, and I see no notable redundancy or scaffold lines. It falls just shy of the very top tier because the lyricism, while excellent, does not yet deliver a singularly unforgettable stylistic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is generally tight: images are vivid, sentences vary rhythmically, and most lines do double duty for mood and information. A few metaphors cluster (“iron cancer,” “metal bones,” “dead grooves of history”), but they are coherent rather than muddled. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the final sentences land cleanly without purple excess. With only minor trimming, this prose is close to publishable as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty, advancing both worldbuilding and character. Figurative language is generally apt and not overstacked, and technical terms are clear without sounding like Wikipedia. There is minimal redundancy or scaffold, and the final image with the pencil and echoed sound lands cleanly. A touch more compression in a few reflective sentences might heighten propulsion, but line-level craft is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong verb choices and metaphors that generally clarify rather than obscure (“laugh was like ice breaking in spring” aligns with both setting and emotional release). Sentences vary in length and structure, maintaining momentum without resorting to scaffolding or repetition. A few lines brush up against the ornate, but there’s no real purple overload or metaphor muddle, and information density is high for the wordcount. Grammar and sequencing are clean, supporting an easy, immersive read.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, theme, character) with little redundancy, and metaphors are precise rather than overwrought. Phrasing like “luminous absence” and “nomadic penumbra” feels deliberate rather than decorative. There are no obvious loops, clunky scaffolds, or register slips, and the final lines land musically. The density is high but remains clear, maintaining momentum in an accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and purposeful, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and rarely feels gratuitous; patterns (reflection/refraction, stone/seed, feather/texture) are taught and paid off. There’s minimal redundancy, and information flows clearly from beat to beat. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the lushness edges toward purple in a few places and could perhaps be tightened without losing effect.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm, high information density, and generally strong image choices (“a thousand silver needles refusing to fall”). Reflection and description mostly pull double duty as scene-setting and thematic framing, so momentum rarely stalls. There are minor instances of conceptual repetition and abstract phrasing, particularly in the explanatory lines about the village’s “capacity to forgive itself,” that feel a notch less vivid than the best images. Overall, though, there are no serious artifacts, loops, or muddled metaphors to undercut the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is controlled: varied rhythms, mostly high information density, and figurative language that supports rather than overwhelms. The echo wordplay (“clarity,” “charity,” “rarity,” “disparity”) is a high point, doing thematic and atmospheric work simultaneously. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and no mixed metaphors or register clashes that damage clarity. A few lines lean toward explicit exposition of theme, but overall momentum and lucidity remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: images are sharp, sentences carry multiple functions, and momentum rarely stalls despite the reflective density. Phrases like “workshops… dissolved rigging floating like jellyfish” or “meaning crystallized like gold in broken places” are evocative without veering into incoherence. There is a mild tendency toward thematic repetition and a few near-generic abstractions (“proof that their existence mattered”) that could be tightened. Still, there are no major loops, mixed metaphors, or artifacts that blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and structure, images are generally precise, and most lines do multiple jobs (advancing scene, character, and theme together). The mirror/shells/cave motifs are handled with economy, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. The main weakness is a slight drift into abstract, generalized language in the closing reflections, which softens momentum and specificity. Overall, the prose is clear, musical without being purple, and easily publishable with minimal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is confident: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is generally apt and not overstacked, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The prose sustains momentum even in reflective passages by anchoring thought in physical action (polishing, opening the vial, adjusting the pulse). Minor issues—a stray name error and a couple of slightly on-the-nose formulations—keep it just below the top tier but don’t materially harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but purposeful: images like “geography of loss was measured in empty chairs, cooling meals” do double thematic and emotional work without redundancy. Sentences vary in length and structure, and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops; nearly every line advances atmosphere, concept, or character. Metaphor use is high but controlled, and the key figurative moves (patina as temporal density, migration as gravitational well of memory) stay clear and coherent. I see no line-level artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with evocative but controlled imagery (“truth-telling, their inner thoughts spilling out in jagged confessions”). There are no major loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors; exposition is concise and usually pulls double duty for worldbuilding and character. The only mild weakness is a few abstract, thematic lines in the final third that could be rendered more through image and action, but they don’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with strong, specific images (“moved through the mist like a question mark,” “brittle as prayer”) and a good balance between description and forward motion. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most lines do at least two jobs—world-building and character or theme—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled; it stops short of purple even in more ornate moments. There are no evident grammatical issues or line-level artifacts that impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and efficient, with sensory density that pulls double duty for atmosphere and theme (“rooms upon rooms of moments” is a strong, compressed image). There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and syntax varies enough to keep the paragraphing from feeling mechanical. Some phrases tip toward the purple or expository (“fragrance almost narcotic,” repeated “empirically intuitive/empirically, intuitively certain,” and the explicit thematic statements at the end), which slightly dulls impact. Overall, though, line-level craft is above-average and never obscures causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense—most sentences carry both image and emotional movement. Metaphoric language is frequent but generally precise; “bleeding starlight” and “voice lacy with menace” are strong recurring vehicles rather than decorative clutter. There is minimal redundancy, and transitions between physical description, memory, and realization are smooth and legible. A few flourishes flirt with purple but do not obscure sense or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished, with strong images (“mathematical poem written in calcium and memory”) and good information density per sentence. There is some tendency toward purple or conceptual stacking—phrases like “scientifically romantic in its precision” and repeated invocations of “presence” and “density” push abstraction. Still, scaffolding and repetition are minimal, grammar and rhythm are clean, and the final paragraphs land with a clear, charged picture. Tightening a few over-wrought phrases would bring the prose into truly elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, dense with information, and generally do double duty (world + character, theme + image). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned; it almost never feels purple or muddled. There’s minimal redundancy, and the paragraphing supports the reflective cadence. A few abstractions could be trimmed, but they don’t meaningfully slow momentum or blur the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, specific, and often do double duty (e.g., “hair-thin crack…leaked away its purpose, drop by silent drop” marries mechanics to theme). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and most metaphors are coherent and grounded. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; prose moves the scene forward without visible padding. A couple of phrases (“map an emotional terrain,” “ordinary miracle”) brush against familiar formulations, but they don’t materially drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery and mostly economical sentences that each advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Metaphors (“like frost on winter glass,” “liquid moonlight”) are apt and not over-stacked, avoiding purple excess. Rhythm varies nicely between longer reflective lines and tighter, more physical beats around the crystallization and rune-writing. Minor tendencies toward thematic restatement are the only small drag on maximum sharpness at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, dense, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence carries character, atmosphere, and/or thematic work. Figurative language—“emotional electricity,” “annotations complete,” “blossoms…falling like forgiveness”—is coherent and controlled rather than piled on indiscriminately. Rhythm varies naturally, with well-judged paragraph breaks around turns (vortex, contact through the Chopin page, the orchard’s final song). I see no clarity-breaking metaphors, repetition loops, or mechanical cadences that would dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, well-paced, and information-dense, and images tend to be coherent and evocative (“time fold around her like origami made of centuries”). The prose sustains momentum without unnecessary scaffolding or repetition, and syntax varies comfortably. There is some stacking of abstractions and high-concept metaphor, but it rarely muddies clarity or the closure image. Trimming a few explanatory or thesis-like sentences would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, economical, and largely free of scaffolding—most sentences carry multiple loads (world-building, mood, theme) without redundancy. Metaphors are striking yet controlled (horizon “so precise it could cut,” fjord “like hammered steel”), and there’s no notable looping or template cadence. Rhythm modulates effectively between long, meditative lines and tighter, countdown-driven urgency without becoming overwrought. A few abstract formulations near the ending (“humanity's desperate agreement”) are slightly flatter than the strongest image-work but do not significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—images typically carry character, setting, and theme at once (e.g., “cathedral of living light,” “mapped every relationship as a network topology”). Line-level rhythm is varied and mostly free of scaffolding or loops; there are few redundant sentences. A couple of phrases repeat (“quiet wildfire of understanding,” “revolutionized”) and the metaphorical register skirts purple without tipping into muddle. No artifacts obscure clarity or dull the closure image, keeping momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is controlled, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that usually do double duty for atmosphere and psychology. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and recurring motifs (rain, light, clover, symbols) are cleanly handled without muddle. Sentences carry information density without padding; there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. A few thematic statements could be tightened or slightly pruned, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or cloud the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—worldbuilding, mood, and character are often advanced in the same line (e.g., the description of the glass harmonica’s sound as “a voice without words”). Figurative language is rich but not overgrown, and metaphors tend to cohere tightly with the phone/connection motif. There are no obvious scaffolding sentences or synonym loops, and the final paragraph lands cleanly without purple inflation. A few concept-phrases (“psychic infrastructure,” “melodically haunted”) flirt with abstraction but don’t materially dull clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with strong sentence-level rhythm and images that often do double duty (e.g., walnut ink as both craft detail and thematic vehicle). There is little redundancy, and figurative language generally remains coherent and grounded in the scene. A few lines verge on thematic telling or sentimentality, but they don’t significantly blur clarity or momentum. Information density is high for the length, and the final sentences land with a clean, charged cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and nearly every line advances character, world, or theme. Figurative language is purposeful and not overstacked, with central metaphors (rumor, reciprocity, failed infrastructure, moon fragments) kept coherent. There’s little to no scaffolding, synonym loops, or clunky exposition; the prose reads smoothly aloud. The small weakness is a few didactic statements that could be trimmed or made more image-driven, but they don’t significantly harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but mostly earns its lyricism, with sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, characterization, and thematic setup—without obvious scaffolding or loops. Metaphors are original and internally consistent, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid a monotonous drumbeat. A few lines flirt with purple or abstract overload, yet they don’t significantly obscure meaning or blunt the closure image. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only light tightening needed, not structural revision.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is controlled and information-dense; most sentences are doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding, interiority, and theme) without noticeable scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is consistent and cohesive—editing, drafts, bookmarks, margins—rather than a mixed grab bag, and it doesn’t obscure basic sense. A few lines summarize big conceptual moves (“history flexed like a poem being edited”) but they function as efficient compression rather than exposition bloat. Rhythm and paragraphing support a smooth escalation from routine to uncanny.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding, and rhythm varies well. Metaphors such as “visual waveforms bloom across the screen like flowers” and “orchestra of absence” are consistent with the piece’s imagery and don’t conflict. There is a mild tendency toward sentimental diction and stacked abstractions in the last third, but they don’t obscure clarity or undercut the closure image. No significant repetition, filter-verb clutter, or syntactic monotony appears.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are generally clean, varied, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“extracted the fragments that institutions tried to bury”). Figurative language is purposeful rather than overstuffed, and there are no significant loops or scaffold phrases dulling momentum. The prose leans slightly toward summary in the middle paragraphs, but transitions remain smooth and clarity intact. A touch more compression in the thematic restatements could tighten the line-level further.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with strong images like “silence pooled in shallow depressions like liquid shadow” and “auroral sorrow” that feel earned and precise. Most sentences pull double duty—advancing atmosphere and emotional state—without padding or synonym churn. There is some density of figurative language, but it’s consistent, legible, and rarely purple; momentum is maintained across the scene. Line-level craft is well above average and does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is clean, economical, and vivid, with strong images like “ribbons of poisonous green” and “his boots knew these paths better than his eyes.” Sentences do multiple jobs—advancing plot while reinforcing atmosphere and character—and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is restrained and mostly precise, avoiding purple excess. It’s solidly publishable prose, though it stops short of the kind of startling, high-risk phrasing that would push it into the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and dense with information, and details often serve multiple purposes (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once). There are occasional purple or abstract turns (“weaver of truths,” “to teach darkness the value of stars”) that feel a touch writerly compared to the otherwise grounded texture, but they don’t derail clarity. No significant scaffolding, repetition loops, or syntactic monotony are evident. The closing image is clean and effective, with momentum carried through to the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with few if any redundancies. Figurative language (“forests of second thoughts,” “amplified quiet”) is consistent and thematically coherent rather than ornamental, and it doesn’t bog momentum. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or clarity issues even in the reflective passages. The final paragraphs in particular show a high level of control, braiding chess, windows, and mist into a focused closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is largely elegant and efficient, with strong images (“longing… like bioluminescence in dark water”) and sentences that usually do more than one job. Rhythm is varied and momentum steady; there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. At times the language edges toward the purple or abstract (“terrible, beautiful liberation,” “the old violence of their world”), slightly diluting impact and specificity. Even so, clarity remains high and the line-level craft is above typical submission quality.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lean, controlled, and image-rich without tipping into purple; nearly every line carries character, world, or theme. Metaphors like “wood curls fell onto his lap like tiny prayers” and “gray and fragile and honest” are apt and unforced. Rhythm varies well, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. A couple of thematic sentences verge on expository, but they don’t materially drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and generally high information density; most lines do double duty for atmosphere and concept. Metaphors like the cracked lake as “ancient porcelain” and cloud-shadow poetry as “quantum states of meaning” are sharp and legible. There is a mild tendency toward abstraction/repetition around “boundaries,” “meaning,” and “aesthetic experience,” but it doesn’t significantly bog momentum or obscure closure. No noticeable scaffolding, template cadence, or figurative muddle touches the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and efficient—images like the reed “glinting…like a tiny golden flame” and “texture of consciousness against the silk of dreams” are evocative yet clear. Sentence rhythm varies and maintains momentum; exposition is compact and anchored in present action. There are a few lines edging toward familiar phrasing or mild redundancy (e.g., explaining her powers and then reasserting their uniqueness), but these do not significantly drag pace or obscure meaning. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publication-ready with only minimal tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is generally elegant and efficient: many sentences do double duty, advancing world and theme together (“the sounds between words,” “the unconscious harmony that emerges…”). The prose varies in rhythm and avoids obvious scaffolding or synonym loops; metaphors are coherent and grounded in the established sensory palette. There is some mild abstraction and density of conceptual language, but it does not obscure action or closure. Overall, it’s polished and publication-ready with only minimal tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and economical, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere, character, and theme—e.g., “genuinely artificial keepsakes that somehow held more truth than photographs ever could.” Metaphors are generally coherent and non-redundant; the observatory, curtains, and stars recur in a controlled pattern rather than as clutter. There are a few slightly abstract or on-the-nose phrases, but little true scaffolding or synonym churn, and rhythm varies well across description, interiority, and dialogue. The final paragraph in particular lands with clear, charged imagery without purple overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “rain drummed against the skylight,” “measuring tape lay coiled…like a sleeping snake,” and the onyx-ink cards do multiple jobs without purple excess. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and exposition is efficiently folded into scene without obvious scaffolding or loops. A few abstract sentences at the end veer toward essay (e.g., “The things people treasured most had no monetary value until dressed in acceptable language”), but they remain clear and do not obscure closure. The prose feels ready for publication with only minor tightening, not structural revision.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, high information density, and images that typically pull double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“evening air against her face like a confession”). Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and legible; metaphors extend the conceit rather than muddle it, and there’s little to no synonym-churn or scaffolding. Sentences vary in length enough to maintain momentum, and there are no obvious grammatical or clarity issues. The slight tendency toward explicit abstraction at the very end is a stylistic choice more than a craft flaw, but it does blunt the lyric charge a little.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, rhythmically pleasing, and information-dense without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but largely purposeful and coherent, building a unified imagery system rather than drifting into purple prose. There are a few near-ornamental abstractions (“particular gravity,” “luminous regret”) that edge toward loftiness, but they are supported by specific images and do not obscure clarity. Momentum is appropriate for a quiet, reflective piece—no major loops or syntactic tics dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and generally do more than one job (moving action, deepening character, and reinforcing motif). Imagery is coherent and not over-stacked; the recurring metaphors of fracture, shedding, and reconstruction stay within a tight semantic field. There’s minor conceptual repetition around belief/observation/data but not enough to drag momentum. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final paragraph’s rhythm supports the quiet, earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty for worldbuilding and character. Figurative language (coffee rings as sedimentary layers, plant “thoughts,” the meteor’s hush) is apt and rarely over-stacked, avoiding purple drift despite the lyric mode. There’s minimal scaffold or repetition; nearly every sentence advances mood, plot, or theme. If anything, one or two metaphors could be trimmed for even more punch, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and story. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and thematically unified (light, film, music, electricity), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. There’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or clumsy syntax, and the final paragraph lands with a clean, memorable image. A slight tendency toward lushness keeps it from feeling razor-edged minimalist, but it never seriously impairs momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, information density is high, and most metaphors are apt and legible (“painted breath,” “witnessing the aurora’s beauty but unable to participate”). There is some piling of elevated abstractions (“essential chaos that made beauty breathe,” “shadowed rapture”) that edges toward purple but never fully muddies sense. The prose rarely loops or repeats ideas without adding something, and transitions between beats are smooth. Tightening a few abstract formulations could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, high-density, and largely free of scaffolding or loops; most lines carry worldbuilding, mood, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and aligned with the story’s conceptual palette (superposition, wave functions, fractured realities), so it rarely feels purple or muddled. Repetitions (“probability,” “superposition,” “sparks”) function as deliberate motifs rather than accidental churn. A more embodied, sensory counterpoint in a few spots could deepen texture, but line-level craft is already publication-grade.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with vivid but controlled figurative language (“sound like revelation,” “hum of insight”). There’s minimal redundancy and no obvious template cadence or synonym loops; most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus theme plus character). A few abstractions near the end (“ability to think beyond the prison of conscious logic”) dilute the otherwise concrete texture but do not obscure meaning or closure. Overall, prose momentum and clarity would be competitive in many quality markets.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most carry multiple functions (advancing plot, character, and atmosphere together). Figurative language—“wore their years like polished driftwood,” “voice breaking like foam on stones”—is vivid yet cohesive in imagery and rarely feels mixed or overwrought. There is little scaffold or redundancy, and the final paragraphs land clearly without figurative muddle. The density of simile/metaphor is high but generally controlled enough not to slow momentum for this quiet, lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: many sentences do double duty (image plus emotion), metaphors are apt and controlled (“steam rising like small prayers”), and there’s little evident scaffolding or repetition. The rhythm shifts naturally from descriptive to more clipped, felt beats around the piano. Figurative density is high but generally well-judged and not so purple as to obscure clarity, including at the ending. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final line is an effective, image-driven cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for setting and theme. Figurative language is confident and largely coherent, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Key beats are shown rather than summarized, especially Ossian’s process with the ink and rune. A small amount of abstract phrasing around time and duty keeps it just shy of truly exceptional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with minimal redundancy and no serious scaffolding artifacts. Figurative language tends to be restrained and apt (“ocean’s slow fever,” “white as bone”) rather than purple. A few phrases lean toward familiar shorthand (“instruments that never lied,” “voice steady despite her racing heart”), but they don’t materially dull the closure. Overall, the prose supports momentum and mood without drawing unintentional attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and carry multiple functions (setting, character, theme) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and images like “silence could roar louder than any engine” feel precise rather than purple. Information flow is clear; each paragraph meaningfully advances situation or emotional charge, and the final sentence lands with a well-charged image. A few abstractions (“the mess they’d made,” “disease itself”) are less vivid than surrounding prose but do not materially harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clear, economical, and often evocative, with strong nouns and verbs (“air tasted of iron and time,” “amber…seemed grown rather than mined”) and minimal redundancy. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and exposition is mostly compressed efficiently into a few dense paragraphs. There are a few mildly abstract or explanatory patches (“This was the implanted destiny her people had forgotten”) that could be dramatized or sharpened, but they don’t significantly drag momentum. Figurative language is measured and coherent; no obvious loops or scaffolding mar the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level prose is clean, precise, and economical; most sentences do multiple jobs (character, theme, and image at once) without padding. Metaphors (oyster/pearl, lighthouse, night-blooming cereus) are coherent and sustained rather than stacked gratuitously. There are no evident loops, scaffolding, or rhythm artifacts that slow momentum or muddy closure. A few phrases verge on the polished-familiar, but overall craft is high and unobtrusively strong.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, dense, and mostly efficient, often doing double duty with image and concept (“pages fluttering like desperate wings”). Sentence rhythm and paragraphing support escalation and the final release. There is some stacking of figurative language and high-register phrases that borders on overrich, but coherence and momentum are preserved. I saw no real loops or scaffolding; trimming a few abstractions could elevate this to truly elite line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is controlled and often striking (“the glare that punished his albino skin like a judgment”; “ink patterns forming, spiraling outward in the cave’s natural air currents”). Sentences do multiple jobs—advancing plot, deepening character, and establishing atmosphere—without much redundancy or clutter. A few phrases lean toward abstraction or pseudo-profundity (“consciously wild,” “these ephemeral maps of a mind trying to explain...”), briefly softening the otherwise sharp texture. Still, rhythm, clarity, and information density are high, with no significant loops or artifacts weighing down momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences are generally lean, varied in rhythm, and information-dense; description, world-building, and emotion often share lines without padding. Figurative language is tasteful and coherent (snow “muffling” sound, ice “cracking with thermal stress”), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple overload. There’s little noticeable scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and the line-level flow supports momentum through the decision rather than stalling it. A few phrases skew slightly familiar (“pulse hammer against her ribs,” “truths too dangerous”), keeping this just shy of the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, with high information density and little redundancy. Figurative language is vivid but not so frequent as to bog the prose; images like “tranquil blaze of sand against glass” feel precise to the setting and tone. There are no noticeable scaffolding phrases, filter stacks, or loops that slow momentum or cloud sense. A few slightly ornate phrasings (“senselessly perceptive eye”) flirt with purple but don’t materially harm clarity or the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Imagery is dense but mostly coherent and well-chosen; “feral lullaby, all teeth and tenderness” is an excellent encapsulating metaphor. There’s some risk of over-saturation in metaphor frequency, yet clarity and momentum hold and the closure image is clean. Minor pruning could further sharpen impact, but the prose is already at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is polished, with strong verbs, concrete nouns, and multi-tasking sentences that carry atmosphere, character, and information at once. Metaphorical density is high but largely controlled and coherent with the astronomical motif, avoiding muddle or mixed images. There are a few spots where the prose leans toward the ornate or explanatory (particularly in the final paragraph’s abstractions), which modestly softens momentum and impact. Overall, however, clarity and propulsion are well maintained and scaffolding is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: high information density, varied syntax, and metaphor deployed with intention rather than scattershot ornament (“a machine like a pipe organ crossed with a supercomputer” does triple duty). There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every line advances character, world, or stakes. The figurative language is frequent but controlled and internally consistent, avoiding mixed metaphors that would blur sense. A touch more spareness at the very end might sharpen, rather than soften, the impact of the thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: images are precise (“memories flaking away like old paint,” “lilac with unease”) and generally avoid mixed or overextended metaphors. Most sentences do multiple jobs—advancing worldbuilding, mood, and character at once—without feeling dense or purple. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops, filler, or rhythm glitches, and the prose reads cleanly aloud. A few slightly abstract phrases (“something taking shape,” “framework that could hold memory”) could lean more into concrete embodiment, but they do not materially hurt momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and generally high-density, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Recurrent images—the tessera, steel hands, shattered sky—are handled with restraint rather than over-insistence. Minor issues include a few familiar metaphors and slightly abstract formulations (“reshape the world”) that momentarily thin specificity, but there are no notable loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles that harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally lean, vivid, and multi-functional, with imagery like “applause rippled across her consciousness as waves of golden warmth” doing emotional and conceptual work. The figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (sound–color–time metaphors), and there’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. A few phrases edge toward purple or slightly redundant (“friactured evening-morning-afternoon,” “bloomed and withered simultaneously”) without adding new pressure, and the prose sometimes tells us what Margaux “understood” rather than showing the realization. These are minor slips that lower density slightly but don’t obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are generally tight, clear, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotional shading. Figurative language (“delicate as spun glass, fragile as willow branches”) sometimes nears purple but stays coherent and motivated by tone. There are no obvious loops or scaffold phrases, and rhythm varies well across exposition, dialogue, and climax.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is fluent and image-rich, with good rhythm and high information density—emotional colors, physical temperature, and time scales are often carried in the same sentence. There is some repetition of ideas (loneliness, witnessing) but not enough to drag momentum, and figurative language remains coherent without slipping into muddle or purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, concise, and rhythmically varied, with images like the echo “unfurl[ing] like a ribbon” and buttons as “a prophecy of human behavior encoded in our smallest losses” doing double thematic and atmospheric work. Sentences generally carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without bloating, and there are no serious artifacts, loops, or muddled metaphors. Some late-summary passages (“Visitors started coming deliberately…”) slide toward exposition rather than scene, slightly dulling immediacy and cost. Overall, the line-level craft is strong and publication-ready, if not formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, generally lean, and carry multiple functions (image, mood, and information) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language (“the silver hush of this remote place,” “winter's end and spring's brave beginning”) is mostly controlled and thematically aligned. The main weakness is a slight tilt toward abstraction and statement in the final paragraph, where insight is told rather than entirely earned through image, softening the closure’s sharpness. Still, there are no major artifacts, and momentum remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is tight, musical, and efficient: images like “fog thick as wool” and “rain gutters’ ticking” do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and almost every line advances character, setting, or idea; there’s little to no scaffold or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent—no mixed metaphors or purple excess—even at emotional peaks. The only restraint on a higher score is that a few abstractions (“complexity into essence,” “spindrift serenity”) slightly soften immediacy compared with the otherwise concrete texture.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically unified around light, form, bees, and time, avoiding mixed metaphors. Momentum holds despite the reflective mode because nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, concept, or character stance. A touch of abstraction near the end (“the accumulated light of gentle acts, phototropic across time”) verges on essayistic but doesn’t significantly dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and rhythmic, description is dense yet generally purposeful, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors (pins and tumblers, light as something to be “measured”) are coherent and grounded in the story’s material culture. A few phrases flirt with sentimentality, but they don’t obscure sense or momentum, and the final paragraph lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, information-dense, and usually serve multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once). Figurative language is vivid but mostly disciplined; metaphors like “brittle glass breaking inside her skull” feel apt rather than overwrought, and there’s little scaffold or paraphrase looping. Momentum is appropriate for a lyric piece—no obvious padding or mechanical repetition, and the final image is sharp and legible. A slight tendency toward abstraction in some thematic lines keeps it just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, economical, and image-dense; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character without clear loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent: the nest, spiral, and prismatic light form a cohesive imagistic set rather than a jumble of mixed metaphors. Syntax varies and supports pacing, and there are no grammatical slips or clarity issues at key beats. Some phrases (“inevitably whimsical, infinitely profound”) flirt with abstraction, but they do not significantly dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences are clean, well-paced, and information-dense; there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. Figurative language is sparing but effective, with no mixed metaphors or purple overreach, and technical terms are used confidently without lapsing into textbook exposition. Momentum is well maintained despite some summary, and the climactic beat (lights flicker, charts levitate, pattern shifts) lands clearly on the line level. It’s very solid craft that could be heightened with a touch more compression or surprise at key lines.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often letting a sentence do multiple jobs (advancing plot, deepening mood, and hinting at theme simultaneously). Figurative language—“darkness that had pooled here for centuries,” the organ as “a patient, lonely voice testing the darkness”—is vivid without tipping into muddle or over-saturation. There’s little to no scaffold, paraphrase looping, or syntactic monotony, and action ordering remains clear. A few abstract assertions in the final third slightly blunt momentum, but they don’t meaningfully obscure or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythm is well-managed, and images like “lanced through sadness like light through glass” are both vivid and legible. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and exposition is compressed efficiently. A few abstractions and thematic statements blunt the sharpness of the imagery near the end, but they don’t significantly obscure clarity or momentum. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and musical, with concrete, vivid images that often do double duty for mood and worldbuilding. There’s very little scaffolding or redundancy, and exposition is compact and purposeful. Figurative language is controlled and coherent to the world’s logic, and nothing in the final third muddies the closure image. A couple of lines verge on high-concept abstraction, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and efficiently imagistic; sentences often do double duty for atmosphere and story without obvious padding. Figurative language—“digital snow on an analog medium,” “sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”—is generally sharp and controlled rather than purple. There are no noticeable loops or scaffold sentences, and action order remains clear despite the abstract conceit. A slight density of elevated abstractions keeps it just below top tier, but momentum and clarity are not harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is lucid, rhythmic, and efficient; most sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, characterization, and theme) without padding. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (e.g., the train offering “perspective,” dusk as “dusky harmony”), with no mixed metaphors or purple excess in peak beats. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the final paragraph lands with a clean, recharged image rather than explanation. A touch more variation in sentence structure in the exposition-heavy middle could add propulsion, but it doesn’t materially harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and efficient, with a good balance of image and clarity (“The observatory dome opened like an eye at midnight” is a strong, framing line). Sentences often do double duty—advancing plot while layering theme or sensory detail—without obvious padding. There are a few mild redundancies and familiar turns (“understanding dawned,” “teaching the same truth they’d always taught”) that keep it just short of truly exceptional line-by-line distinctiveness. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to maintain momentum and avoid sludge.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is strong and efficient: images like “a perpetual cyclone of white blossoms and rotting fruit” do multiple jobs (atmosphere, decay, motion) without piling on. Sentence structures are varied, with few if any scaffold lines or paraphrase loops, and the narrative moves forward steadily. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and metaphors remain coherent with the established world. Line-level craft is very close to publication-ready, with only occasional near-abstract formulations (“warlike serenity,” “iron forged in stillness”) that could be grounded more in concrete sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with many lines carrying atmosphere, character, and concept simultaneously (“terror and joy braided together” is exemplary). Figurative language is generally apt and not over-stacked, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase loop. A few abstractions and near-platitudes (“a single, purposefully curious force,” “where all possible futures converged”) blunt immediacy by floating above the concrete situation. Overall momentum remains strong, and clarity is never sacrificed for ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are tight, imagery is striking but not overstacked, and most lines do more than one job (world-building plus theme plus emotion). Phrases like “understanding dawn across his face like a bruise” and “destinies change shape in the wearing” are memorable without feeling purple. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism. A few familiar metaphors (“like I swallowed wasps”) are the only minor drag on otherwise polished work.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually do double duty for character, setting, and mood (“confidently uncertain, the station manager had called him, which was both generous and devastating” is an efficient example). Metaphors (prayer flag, reverb after lights come up) are coherent and thematically aligned without piling up into purple prose. There’s minimal redundancy and no significant scaffolding or template cadence. A couple of thematic statements verge on tell-y, but they don’t materially drag momentum or obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally tight, with good information density and minimal scaffolding; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or image plus theme). Figurative language is selective and apt, and there are no major loops or synonym churn. Rhythm varies nicely between longer reflective lines and sharper, image-driven ones, supporting momentum despite a contemplative mode. A few abstract statements could be sharpened into images, but they don’t significantly drag the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and cadence, images are generally clean, and nearly every line carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, theme). Phrases like “moved with the serenity of winter sunlight filtering through ice” are vivid without stacking incompatible metaphors, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. A few lines approach purple (“a massive sculpture of migrating identities,” some abstract labeling) and the density of metaphor is high, which risks softening impact rather than sharpening it. Still, clarity and momentum never truly suffer, keeping this comfortably in a publishable range.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, theme, emotion) without obvious scaffolding, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. Figurative language (e.g., “mausoleum for everything people had relinquished”) is mostly apt and not overstacked. A few abstractions and slightly purple turns (“latent radiance,” “dissolve the walls between hearts”) edge toward on-the-nose, but they don’t seriously obscure clarity or closure. Overall, it reads polished and publication-ready with only minor trims desirable.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images like “cathedral of green silence” and the taped bellows “like the station itself was breathing.” Sentences carry multiple jobs—advancing setting, character, and theme without much scaffolding or redundancy. A few lines veer toward purple or overt thematic summary, particularly in the final paragraph, but they don’t obscure clarity or momentum. Rhythm and syntax vary well enough to avoid monotony, keeping the piece readable and textured.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is generally tight and musical, with varied syntax and good information density; most lines serve multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character at once). Figurative language is frequent but not overstacked, and images like “Understanding bloomed like cold fire” or “air tasted of cardamom and forgotten names” feel coherent and on-theme. There is minimal redundancy or scaffold, and action/order remain clear despite the abstract setting. A few explanatory or slightly abstracted phrases could be pared back for even greater sharpness, but they don’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character, and metaphors like “old starlight” or “perforated destiny” are striking and largely coherent. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the prose maintains momentum despite its density. Occasionally the figurative load stacks up (“truth would propagate in the dark places where empires couldn’t reach”) in a way that feels slightly on-the-nose, but it doesn’t significantly blur sense. Overall, rhythm and precision are well controlled for this kind of lyrical speculative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished, clear, and rhythmically varied, with high information density—most sentences do double duty in worldbuilding and mood. Imagery (carved ice walls, steam-softened threshold, emerald chip blazing) is vivid without descending into sustained purple excess, and there are few if any scaffold or redundancy artifacts. A couple of abstractions (“potential unrealized,” “youth interrupted”) lean toward summary, but they don’t significantly blunt the closure. Line-level craft is near–publishable quality for elite venues, only slightly shy of the very top tier in distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythmic variety and high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language (“vineyard hush,” “clouds moved in their eternal dance”) is evocative and mostly disciplined, avoiding mixed metaphors or excess. There are no obvious scaffolding loops or template cadences, and the final image of the hairpin as heartbeat/promise/breath lands cleanly. At times the diction tilts slightly lush, which may be a stylistic choice but just edges short of the rarefied 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, clean syntax, and a high ratio of lines that do double duty (advancing scene and theme together). Metaphors (cloak of doubt, refraction, wind chimes as choices) are clear and cohesive rather than over-stacked, and there’s little to no scaffold or repetition. Pacing holds smoothly through reflection without stagnation, and the final paragraph lands cleanly on an image rather than explanation. A few lines verge on thematic telling but do not materially blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is strong line by line: images are clear, rhythm is varied, and most sentences do more than one job (world, theme, mood). Recurrent motifs (ripples, magnetism, hush) accumulate rather than loop redundantly, and metaphors are mostly coherent and apt. A few phrases flirt with purple or explanation (“through years moving backward that truth required careful weaving”) but do not significantly slow or obscure the reading experience. Overall, density and clarity are well-balanced and the closure image is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and image-rich, with good information density—most sentences advance world, character, and atmosphere together. Figurative language is generally coherent and grounded in the story’s sound/stone/bird lexicon, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. Momentum is constrained more by design than by clutter; there are no evident loops or scaffolding sentences. The main ceiling comes from occasional abstraction-heavy lines that explain concepts explicitly where the imagery is already doing the work, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, concise, and rhythmically varied, with strong images that usually do multiple jobs at once (e.g., breath clouds in thin air anchoring both body and altitude). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and clarity remains high throughout. There is minimal redundancy or scaffold; each paragraph advances atmosphere, character, or thematic pressure. A touch of abstraction in some thematic sentences keeps it from feeling utterly taut, but line-level craft is clearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong verbs, specific nouns, and multi-tasking sentences that carry atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Rhythm varies nicely across descriptive and action beats, and figurative language, while frequent, is controlled and thematically aligned rather than scattershot. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line earns its place. A few phrases flirt with purple, but they do not obscure sense or closure and remain consistent with the chosen lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and generally economical, with images like “filtering light from the collapsing cosmos beyond” and “filtering the universe’s death rattle for patterns” doing double duty for mood and concept. Information density is high without feeling like an exposition dump; technical terms (causality reversals, quantum fluctuations) are concise and intelligible. There are few, if any, scaffold or synonym loops, and the final paragraph lands crisply. The main room for elevation would be more surprising micro-details or turns of phrase that deepen character while maintaining this clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and vivid metaphor that generally clarifies rather than obscures. Recurring language around echoes, sacrifice, and sea monsters is controlled and purposeful, not repetitive scaffolding. A few sentences verge on thematic exposition rather than image-driven implication, slightly dulling momentum in places. Overall the prose remains clear, propulsive enough for a lyrical piece, and largely free of loops or muddled figures.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; nearly every line advances character, world, or stakes without visible scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors (ocean as oversaturated sponge, viaduct as frozen river of light) are apt and consistent, avoiding purple excess. There are no significant artifacts—no template cadences, no synonym churn, no confusing figurative knots—and the final image is crisp. Minor reuse of terms like “lukewarm” and “brittle devotion” feels intentional rather than sloppy, keeping the piece in a high professional band.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is controlled and mostly economical, with sentences doing multiple jobs (moving action while layering atmosphere or theme). Phrases like “materialize like a photograph in developing fluid” and “expunge everything back into silence” are vivid without tipping into purple excess. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and rhythm varies enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical. A few lines verge on thematic exposition rather than image, but they don’t significantly sap momentum or obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, images are mostly clean and precise (“living calligraphy,” “fruit in all seasons simultaneously”), and there’s high information density without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but rarely overwrought, and it generally serves both atmosphere and theme rather than acting as decorative clutter. Momentum is maintained even through reflective passages because each reflection reorients the present stakes. A touch of purple flourish in places keeps it just shy of the very top tier but does not impede clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense without purple excess. Figurative language (“clouds shifted like a silver sea,” “nocturnal arbor… sang with light”) is mostly fresh and not over-stacked. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line advances character, world, or tension. It’s polished and publishable, though not quite at the dazzling level of top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally precise, rhythmic, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for worldbuilding and psychology (“Timelines branched and merged like neural pathways”). There are no major loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles; repetition of certain phrases (“complementary opposites,” “history rewrites itself”) reads as intentional motif rather than padding. A few abstract formulations could be grounded more concretely, but they don’t impede clarity or momentum. Line-level craft is strong enough for high-tier markets.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences are generally clean, with varied rhythm and few redundancies; information density is good, and most lines serve multiple functions (mood, character, and plot). There is some mild purple phrasing (“storm-born silence,” “hush of a possibility just born”) but it does not obscure sense or derail momentum. Expository passages about other designers and the sabotage pattern are concise enough not to bog the scene. No major loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles touch the closure, and the final image is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is controlled, with varied rhythm and generally high information density—many lines do double duty for image and emotion. Metaphors (dust as galaxies, echoes as the tunnel “turning [notes] over and over”) are coherent and not over-stacked. There is mild repetition of conceptual language around silence/quiet and some slightly abstract phrasing in the last paragraph, but it doesn’t materially blunt the closure image. Overall, the prose is polished and publishable with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally lean yet textured, with metaphors that feel coherent to the dreamlike setting (“breathing wool,” “the garden inhaled”). Most lines do at least two jobs—advancing setting, mood, and interior stakes simultaneously—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative density is high but rarely tips into muddle, and crucial beats (grasping the pendant, waking) remain clear and sharply imaged. A few abstractions (“coherent singularity of her own existence”) are more conceptual than they need to be, but they don’t significantly impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually do more than one job (character, world, and theme co-encoded). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and striking (“frost patterns on a corpse,” “frozen bloom of emotion”), staying just shy of purple. There are no noticeable scaffold loops, syntactic monotony, or clarity issues, and rhythm supports the contemplative-to-breakthrough arc. A few thematic phrases lean abstract, but they don’t materially drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are striking yet mostly coherent, and there’s little slack or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but usually purposeful, doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“machines dreamed of their former purpose”). There is some conceptual repetition around endings/beginnings and silence-as-message that could be trimmed for maximum tautness, and a few abstract phrases (“fantasy practicality”) flirt with jargon. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, grammatically clean, and largely free of loops or scaffolding; almost every sentence advances either worldbuilding or plot. Lyric touches are restrained so they don’t devolve into purple, and rhythm varies comfortably across the piece. There is a mild tendency toward explanatory phrasing (“Mateo understood immediately,” “That paradox had always been its strength”) that flattens peak beats that could be dramatized more viscerally. Overall, line-level control is solid and publication-ready, if not formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, with varied sentence rhythms and several strong images (“walls bent at impossible angles yet obeyed every law of perspective,” the sinew thread pulsing with “the vibration of human consciousness”). Line-level clarity is high, and most sentences do multiple jobs without scaffolding or obvious loops. The main weakness is a slight increase in abstraction and didactic phrasing near the end, where concrete image gives way to declarative insight. Still, momentum and readability remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with strong image choice (“geological processes compressed into seconds,” “stars through water-memories”) and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Sentences do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, character, and theme—without obvious bloat, and rhythm varies nicely between exposition and the trench climax. Figurative language is consistent and coherent with the premise, and there are no major syntactic or clarity snags. A few concept-dense sentences could be pruned or slightly simplified to sharpen momentum even more.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong sentence rhythm and high information density; most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus tone, or character plus theme). A few metaphors cluster early (“bruised hour,” “spilled ink,” “spiderweb shadows”) but they’re coherent and not so dense as to feel purple or obscure meaning. There’s minimal redundancy and no serious scaffold or template cadence; exposition is compact. The only constraint on a higher score is that some abstractions (“emotional resonance,” “incidental heroism”) slightly thin the immediacy in peak beats instead of always being grounded in fresh concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in rhythm, description is dense but mostly efficient, and metaphors are coherent and well chosen. Phrases like “a crashing hush that was neither fully sound nor silence” and “information ghosts” carry weight without stacking into purple prose. There’s little to no obvious scaffolding, repetition, or synonym churn; exposition is concise. A few abstractions (“golden truth,” “institutional forgetting”) could be grounded in image, but they don’t materially drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, few redundancies, and images that typically do double duty (emotional and thematic) without piling up into purple prose. Metaphors are mostly coherent and controlled; “cathedral silence” and the pearl-like dome, for instance, are vivid but not distracting. Exposition is compact, and nearly every line either advances the scene or deepens character/theme. A couple of aphoristic turns in the closing paragraphs slightly reduce sharpness, but they don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “a dark thread running through its heart like a frozen scream” and “voices made from stone and light and motion” are vivid and purposeful. Sentences generally carry multiple jobs (world-building, character, and theme) without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. The prose leans lush but mostly avoids mixed metaphors or figurative clutter that would obscure action; momentum through the middle holds. At times, density is uniform—nearly every sentence reaches for metaphor—which slightly flattens rhythm and leaves little room for sharper, plainer beats to punctuate turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are generally sharp, and most metaphors (“secret kept from winter itself,” “harmony untamed”) support mood and concept without muddling clarity. Information density is high; nearly every line advances atmosphere, worldbuilding, or character. There is some piling-on of figurative language and abstracted phrasing (“cognitive contamination,” “cosmic joke”) that edges toward purple in places, but it doesn’t significantly obscure the closure image or causality. A very demanding market might ask for a slight tightening of ornamentation to heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences have varied rhythm, strong verbs, and multi-tasking images that advance both atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; metaphors like statues weeping liquid gold that feeds roots are vivid and grounded in the world’s logic. There’s minimal scaffold or redundancy, and the prose maintains momentum while being lush. A few lines edge toward abstraction or slogan (“the very foundation of fear”) but they don’t significantly blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, clear, and purposeful, with good information density and very few redundant sentences; images tend to do double duty (worldbuilding plus theme). Rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony, and there are no real syntactic stumbles or confusing metaphors. A few lines veer toward mild abstraction or paraphrase of what’s already implicit (“That’s what they all were—trapped and trying to remain powerful,” “This careful choreography… had reunited seventeen families”), softening momentum and subtlety. Still, there’s no serious purple-prose problem or looping, just occasional on-the-nose reinforcement that keeps it just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and musical, with varied sentence rhythm and a generally high information density—most lines do double duty for mood and character. There are a few lines that verge on purple or redundant, especially in the final thematic summation, but they don’t seriously drag momentum or obscure sense. Metaphors (e.g., sound “between sound and imagination,” the train as shrine) are coherent and well-chosen. Line-level control is strong enough for near-publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, character, and concept) with little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors (“analog memories… created wells of meaning that trapped light and feeling”) are apt and consistent with the physics/geometry frame, avoiding mixed or overwrought images. Information density is high yet readable; description is selective and purposeful rather than touristic. I see no significant loops, syntactic monotony, or artifacts that dull momentum or obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and generally high-information, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (e.g., “the luminous absence where darkness gave way to color”). Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to be incoherent, and key metaphors (exposure/development, bleeding watercolors) are thematically aligned. There are mild tendencies toward abstraction and repetition of certain registers (“luminous,” “between-places”), but they function as motif more than artifact. Line-level clarity and rhythm remain strong through the ending, supporting rather than obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally tight, with clean syntax, minimal redundancy, and a good balance between scene and summary. Phrases like “across the hush of cosmic possibility” and “secrets envelope themselves in layers of fear” flirt with purple but remain legible and on-tone. Information density is decent: most sentences pull double duty for mood and action. There are no serious artifacts, loops, or figurative muddles that blunt the closure, though a slight trimming of abstractions would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and efficient: images like “iron ribs that curved like whale bones” and “the water around her ignited with memory” are striking yet clear. Sentences pull multiple duties (world-building, mood, character) with little scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; it never collapses into purple or mixed metaphors, and there are no noticeable loops or template cadences. It’s high-level work that propels rather than bogs the narrative, even if it doesn’t quite achieve the absolute spareness and inevitability of top-1% pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are vivid yet mostly economical, and sentences often do double duty for setting, mood, and character. Phrases like “an afternoon shadow caught in glass” and “that particular quality of suspended silence where absence becomes tangible” are memorable without sliding into full purple prose. There is some density of metaphor and a mild explanatory redundancy in the final triplet, but it doesn’t materially slow momentum or obscure meaning. Syntax varies enough to keep rhythm alive, and there are no noticeable technical errors.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and generally economical: sentences often do double duty with image and function, and there’s a pleasing variety in rhythm and structure. Figurative language is vivid but mostly controlled; phrases like “colors sang and wonder breathed” fit the established mode without collapsing into muddle. Occasionally the narration leans toward abstract or slightly redundant phrasing (“power and possibility,” reiterations of what wonder represents), brushing against mild purple but not enough to seriously drag momentum or clarity. There are no significant loops, scaffolds, or syntactic artifacts, especially near the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clean grammar, and high information density without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors such as the net accumulating silence like prayers are apt and coherent, with only minor flirtations with purple but no real muddle. Momentum holds through descriptive passages because each line also advances atmosphere or stakes. The prose is elegant and smooth, though it stops just short of the kind of line-by-line surprise that would push it into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, and most carry multiple functions (setting, character, and theme at once). Figurative language is generally precise and on-concept, with few strained or mixed metaphors. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; the prose moves forward cleanly. A couple of abstractions could be grounded more concretely, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that typically do double duty (e.g., “brass and copper blooming with verdigris like underwater flowers”). There’s minimal redundancy and no obvious scaffold or AI-pattern loops; rhythm supports the contemplative tone without dragging. A few metaphors lean toward the lyrical-familiar (“cathedral of loss”), but they remain coherent and do not muddy clarity or pressure. Overall the prose is polished and efficient while maintaining beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and efficient: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy, and syntax is varied. Imagery is mostly apt and controlled; metaphor doesn’t snarl the sense, and there are few if any genuine purple patches. A slight tendency toward lush abstraction (e.g., emotional frequencies, tinkersong wonder) could be sharpened with a few more concrete, pressured details in peak beats. Overall, the prose would be competitive in many markets but could use one more pass to achieve elite precision.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences are generally clean, varied, and purposeful, with several strong images (the goggles refracting scattered light into legible text, the servants moving “like clockwork”). There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the pacing stays brisk despite reflective content. Some lines verge on abstraction and mild purple (e.g., “fully, messily, affectionately alive”) and reiterate the same conceptual ground, slightly dulling impact. Still, line-level craft is above-average and does not impede clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, high information density, and metaphors that are largely precise and thematically aligned. There is some repetition of the core idea (empty spaces retaining memory) and occasional near-paraphrases, but they read as motif rather than padding. Figurative language is frequent yet controlled enough not to blur sense or stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clear, economical, and often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“stars fractaling into infinity,” “forbidden knowledge in secret book safes”). Rhythm and paragraphing support the contemplative tone without bogging in repetition or scaffolding. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and there are no significant loops or template cadences that dull momentum. A few phrases recur (“fractally precise”) but function more as motif than artifact, so line-level craft reads controlled and polished.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences are varied, purposeful, and generally high in information density, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and metaphors (murmurations as maps, language as cartography) are coherent and thematically aligned. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; the prose moves cleanly from beat to beat. A few lines lean into gentle lyricism, but momentum and clarity are never seriously compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, and character), and avoid redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but not cluttered; metaphors are clean and non-contradictory, and the prose remains clear even in its most ornate passages. Information density is high—nearly every line adds either atmospheric, thematic, or causal value—without stalling momentum. The final paragraphs land crisply with a strong, image-driven cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and purposeful, with good information density and minimal redundancy. Imagery is concrete and apt (“roots pushing through poisoned soil”) without tipping into purple prose. There are no noticeable rhythm artifacts, filter-verb clusters, or copy-level errors, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. The style is more polished than dazzling, but it never gets in the way of the story and occasionally lifts it.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and images that do multiple jobs—e.g., dominoes of light and fractal waves both illuminate concept and atmosphere. Sentence rhythm is varied, and there is minimal scaffolding or redundant paraphrase. However, some metaphors and key terms (“nested patterns,” “hush,” “lullaby”) recur enough to feel a bit over-insisted rather than freshly refigured each time, edging toward mild overwriting. These repetitions do not obscure clarity or closure, but they slightly blunt impact at a level where elite markets expect absolute tautness.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is controlled and generally concise, with vivid but comprehensible metaphors and good syntactic variety. Information density is high without obvious scaffolding or explanatory repetition, and the prose maintains momentum through the chase. There are a few slightly familiar turns of phrase and a mild tendency toward lyrical stacking, but they don’t obscure clarity or dull the ending. Overall, this reads as polished and publication-ready with room for fine-tuning.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that do more than one job (e.g., foam as both physical detail and conceptual key). Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and there are no major loops or scaffold phrases. The rhythm supports a contemplative but forward-moving pace, especially around the urn and foam-insight beats. A couple of thematic statements could be pared back or converted into image to reach an even leaner, more electric line.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with rich but mostly disciplined imagery (“transparent fruit trees refracting clouds into prismatic fragments,” “memory of where light had been”). Sentences generally multitask—building world, theme, and character simultaneously—without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. There is some risk of lyrical density tipping toward purple, but metaphors remain coherent and patterned rather than mixed. Momentum is steady for a quiet piece, and the final paragraph lands with a clear, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: figurative language is vivid yet mostly economical, and nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, worldbuilding, or character. Phrases like “kneading away the sharpest edges” efficiently yoke the culinary motif to the thematic task without feeling forced. There is minimal repetition or scaffolding, and syntax is varied enough to keep rhythm from going mechanical. A few conceptual clusters (“subsume,” “stored remorse”) are leaned on recurrently, but they function more as motif than as redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight, with high information density—sentences often carry worldbuilding, mood, and character at once. Recurring phrases like “under the hush of borrowed starlight” function as intentional motifs rather than scaffolding, and figurative language is controlled and thematically apt. There is minimal redundancy or syntactic monotony, and rhythm suits the reflective yet forward-moving feel. A few lines approach the edge of over-articulation or abstraction, but they do not significantly slow or blur the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level writing is polished, with strong rhythms and high information density—many sentences carry setting, character, and theme simultaneously (e.g., the opening with “helical fracture pattern” echoing neural architecture). Metaphors are generally apt and thematically aligned, but the density of figurative language and recurring constructions around “dreams” and “abandoned purpose” edge toward purple and mildly repetitive in the final third. There’s little obvious scaffolding or redundancy, and clarity remains intact throughout. Slight tightening and more varied imagery in the climax could elevate it to a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. Metaphors (spiral within a spiral, garden of secrets, latent blaze) are coherent and sustained rather than piled on randomly, avoiding purple excess. There are a few slightly repetitive turns (“clandestinely luminous,” “latent blaze”) but they function more as motif than artifact and do not slow momentum. Line-level execution is strong enough for serious venues, though not quite at the breathtaking level that would command immediate top-tier placement.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and musical, with high information density—many sentences do double duty in worldbuilding and theme (“Each crack a record of decades enduring tension, weather, and the weight of messages”). Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and non-redundant, avoiding mixed metaphors or scaffolding loops. Rhythm varies well between long, flowing description and tighter action beats, and the final paragraph lands cleanly without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and generally do multiple jobs (world-building, characterization, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“translating silence,” “hopeful melancholy,” “emotional architecture”) is mostly apt and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. A few abstractions and conceptual phrases are stacked in the middle section, but they don’t significantly blur clarity or drag momentum. The final image of the cliffs humming their approval is clean and effectively recalls earlier sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax and strong information density; most sentences do double duty for image and theme. Metaphors (e.g., different “frequencies” and colors of silence) are coherent and sustained rather than scattered. There is mild overwriting at times and occasional conceptual repetition around “silence,” “recovery,” and “empathy,” which slightly slows momentum in a short piece. Still, clarity never suffers, and the final cadence is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong verbs, concrete sensory detail, and efficient sentences that usually do more than one job (worldbuilding plus character plus theme). There’s little in the way of scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony, and the overall rhythm reads well aloud. Figurative language is present but not stacked to the point of purple prose, and metaphors (“wildflower hush,” “tide of thought”) are coherent. A few lines veer toward slogan-like abstraction, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is elegant: sentences are varied, images precise (“shadows that moved like thoughts,” “fruit dropped skyward… caught by the trees’ reaching upper roots”), and exposition is folded into action without clunky scaffolding. There’s little redundancy or filler; nearly every line advances setting, mood, or concept. A few moments lean toward abstraction or overt explanation (particularly the thematic summation near the end), but they don’t seriously drag momentum or blur imagery. Figurative language is frequent yet controlled, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is clear, well-paced, and dense with information; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus theme, or action plus mood). Imagery is generally fresh and controlled, and there’s little in the way of scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic templating. A few abstractions and repeated conceptual phrases (“singular convergence,” “architecture of disaster”) flirt with heaviness but don’t seriously impede momentum or clarity. The closing image of the wind flowing clean is crisp and earned, tying setting and theme without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length, dense with meaning, and generally avoid redundancy or scaffold. Figurative language is rich but mostly coherent and thematically aligned, especially around silence, sound, and sculpture; it rarely lapses into mixed metaphor or purple excess. A few abstractions (“oscillating repose,” “every possible song”) flirt with vagueness but remain anchored by surrounding concrete imagery. Momentum holds throughout despite the lyric density, with no major loops or clutter dulling the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every sentence advances mood, world, or character. Figurative language is generally apt and economical, with only occasional flourishes that feel a touch decorative rather than necessary. Syntax remains clear even when describing complex phenomena (“the air began to fold”), preserving momentum. It’s strong, publication-ready line work, if not yet at a breathtaking or formally daring level.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, character) with high information density and generally varied rhythm. Imagery is consistently fresh (“joy sharp as broken glass, love that tasted of copper and rain”) without collapsing into incoherence or mixed metaphors. A few formulations approach the edge of purple, but they remain legible and purposeful, and there’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic templating. The final sentences land cleanly and musically, reinforcing earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and evocative images like the pendant catching auroral greens and violets or memories “germinating back into the world.” Sentences vary in rhythm, and description usually does double duty for atmosphere and character. There is a slight tendency toward abstract phrasing in the Keeper’s exposition, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum or obscure sense. No notable repetition, muddled metaphor, or structural artifacts undermine the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; images like “dawn mist still clung to the crystalline branches” and the frost resolving into memories are vivid without becoming purple. Sentences tend to do multiple jobs—advancing plot, building atmosphere, and revealing character—while avoiding redundancy and scaffolding. There are no major metaphor tangles or cadence loops, and the final paragraph lands with a clear, resonant image. A slight tendency toward explicit thematic phrasing is the only notable stylistic softness.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and purposeful, balancing atmosphere with clarity; most sentences do at least two jobs (world-building and emotional shading). Figurative language (“time’s unraveling tapestry,” “frame an absence”) is rich but generally coherent and not overstacked. A few adjective clusters and repeated constructions risk mild purple-ness, yet they don’t obscure sense or momentum. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the final line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length, images are clear, and most lines perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character at once). Figurative language—“floating stone arches that drifted like sleeping giants,” “veins of crystallized sap”—is vivid and not overstacked. There’s little scaffolding or repetition; the prose maintains momentum while allowing a reflective tone. It stops short of truly astonishing phrasing but is consistently controlled and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level writing is polished: strong verbs, dense information per sentence, and vivid, controlled figurative language (“cathedral of metal ribs,” “reality would become permeable”). There’s little scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or concept plus image). The prose leans lush but generally stops short of purple, and rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum in a mostly static physical scene. No obvious loops, metaphoric muddles, or mechanical errors interfere with clarity, including at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clean, economical, and vivid, with strong images that do more than one job (e.g., cairns as both communication system and anticipatory graves). There’s minimal scaffolding, good syntactic variety, and no serious clarity issues. A few lines verge on sentimental or thematically declarative rather than strictly image-driven, especially near the end. These are minor enough not to damage momentum but do prevent the line-level from feeling utterly razor-cut.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences are generally tight yet rich, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood without obvious redundancy. Metaphoric density is high but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (light, reflection, storms, time), and syntax varies enough to avoid a mechanical cadence. There are a couple of near-platitude abstractions and places where the lyricism could be pared for sharper impact, but they don’t materially obscure action or closure. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publication-ready with only light trimming.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong images like “exploded with quiet fire” and “clouds moved through the valley like searching hands” that feel coherent with the story’s aesthetic. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most lines do double duty—advancing atmosphere and theme while keeping the scene moving. Figurative language is dense but not muddled; metaphors (light, structure, trails) reinforce each other rather than conflict. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the final paragraphs land with clear, charged imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences are balanced and purposeful, with minimal redundancy and clear progression; most lines do more than one job (worldbuilding plus emotion plus theme). Figurative language is vivid but not overstacked, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. A few phrases tilt toward abstraction (“sorrow could be measured, witnessed, and healed”) instead of image, slightly dulling immediacy, but not enough to drag momentum. Overall, line-level craft is polished and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, images are vivid without devolving into metaphor piles, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Almost every sentence advances atmosphere, worldbuilding, or emotional stakes, giving the piece high information density. A few phrases tread near purple (“the smell of bread baking in ovens long cold”) but generally remain precise and grounded in the world’s logic. Momentum stays intact through the climax and final image, with no artifacts dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, clear, and information-dense, with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is mostly fresh and apt, and transitions between reflection and present action are smooth. There is some mild abstraction/therapy-adjacent phrasing (“keenly empathetic nature,” “compassionate distance”) that could be sharpened into more embodied specifics, but it doesn’t significantly slow momentum or muddle images. Rhythm supports the quiet, contemplative mood without feeling monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and generally do more than one job (advancing scene, building world, and carrying theme simultaneously). Imagery is vivid but not so overgrown that it chokes momentum, and there’s little to no synonym churn or paraphrase looping. The prose handles complex ideas with clarity and minimal scaffolding, and the closing image ties earlier motifs together cleanly. A few slightly ornate word choices risk calling attention to themselves, but they don’t obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and economical; sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character at once) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent—e.g., “frost patterns on winter glass,” “skeleton of faith”—with no metaphor muddle. Rhythm varies well, avoiding template cadences or scaffold phrases, and the final image of the slide transforming the library feels earned rather than purple. I see no line-level artifacts, loops, or clarity slips that blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language (“smelled of brine and secrets,” “carrying her father’s silence like armor”) is vivid and mostly economical. Rhythm supports scene beats, shifting from atmospheric opening to tighter exchanges in the confrontation. Occasional familiar constructions (“the market seemed to hold its breath”) slightly blunt originality but do not harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and generally pull double duty in worldbuilding and emotion. Figurative language is frequent but internally coherent, maintaining a data/weather/aurora lexicon that feels intentional rather than purple. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism. A few phrases (“terrestrially cosmic”) flirt with ornament, but they don’t materially obscure sense or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and most metaphors (“auroral sorrow,” “woman screaming color”) are striking and coherent. Exposition is compact and interwoven, and there is minimal redundancy or scaffolding. At times the prose edges toward purple and explanatory, especially in the final moralizing lines, but clarity and momentum remain intact. No significant structural artifacts or loops interfere with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is clean, with varied rhythms and strong, specific imagery; most lines do double duty for worldbuilding and character. There’s little to no redundancy or scaffolding, and exposition is compressed efficiently (“The oasis had dried three years prior…”). Figurative language is controlled rather than purple, and there are no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks that bog momentum. Minor spots of thematic telling in the caretaker’s dialogue are the only real roughness and don’t significantly dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Figurative language (e.g., clouds as a “pale ocean,” imperfections making bells “more honest”) is apt and not overstacked. There’s minimal redundancy and no obvious scaffolding or mechanical cadence; the prose sustains momentum despite its lyricism. The closing lines, in particular, are tightly honed and thematically charged without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)

Images such as “nostalgia that corroded their circuits like rust” and “darkness captured in a sealed vial” are fresh and clear, doing double duty for world and emotion. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or situation. A few moments edge toward thematic overtness rather than pure image, but they don’t meaningfully impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are clear, well paced, and purposeful; there are no obvious loops, muddled metaphors, or structural artifacts. The prose carries information, atmosphere, and theme efficiently, often doing more than one job per line, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. A few phrasings lean toward familiar literary shorthand (“noise of the world,” “through every storm”), and some thematic sentences could be tightened. Overall line-level execution is strong and polished, if slightly conventional.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with strong, clean sentences that often do double duty—advancing world, character, and theme in the same line (e.g., encryption as “poetry, as rhythm, as the mathematical music”). Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and coherent, and there’s little to no synonym churn or paraphrase looping. Information density is high without becoming opaque, and transitions between ideas are smooth. A few images tread familiar ground (water as preservation, webs, light in the deep), but they’re executed gracefully enough not to drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and economical: nearly every sentence pulls weight for atmosphere, worldbuilding, or emotional charge, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Imagery is precise and often striking (“gasoline-slick with dissolved minerals,” “crystallized moments”), with metaphors that remain coherent and grounded in the story’s sensory palette. Sentence rhythm varies well, supporting both the eerie calm of the docks and the disorienting gravity shifts underground. A few abstractions (“transformed beyond recognition,” “recursive and purposeful”) skim the edge of telling but don’t significantly blunt momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without bloat. The figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and thematically unified around silence, mapping, and cosmic/terrestrial tension. There’s little scaffold or repetition beyond a few echoing abstractions of “silence” and “hush,” which fit the motif. It’s polished and publishable, though an editor might trim a metaphor or two for maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose has strong rhythm, good sentence variety, and a high information density—lines often carry setting, character, and theme simultaneously. Metaphors (cornerstones lying, meteors as punctuation) are controlled and coherent rather than stacked to excess, and there’s minimal lexical or syntactic redundancy. Almost every paragraph advances either the emotional stakes or the conceptual frame; there’s little scaffolding or filler. It’s polished and publication-ready at the line level, if not formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“Each flower she tended held a quarantined memory…” is both world-building and emotional frame). Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and figurative language is mostly clean and thematically aligned. There’s mild risk of purple repetition around beauty/loss and radiance/twilight, but it doesn’t seriously drag momentum or clarity. Line-level craft is strong enough for high-tier venues, though a ruthless trim of a few overt thematic statements could make it even sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and nearly every image does double duty (worldbuilding plus theme or pressure). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and disciplined—“ink mixed with her own resolve,” the key as “permission itself,” and stalactite drips marking empires all reinforce the same conceptual lattice. There’s minimal scaffold or redundancy; momentum never stalls despite the reflective texture. A few phrases edge toward the decorative (“pearl twilight” recurs close to theme-statement territory), but they don’t materially dull clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong, often striking images (“shadows pooled like spilled ink,” “reed-blown melancholy”) and generally high information density—most sentences advance both mood and concept. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not excessively stacked, so the rhythm stays readable rather than purple. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the piece moves forward consistently. A few phrases (e.g., “webs of intrigue,” “richly perceptive mind”) feel slightly generic beside the sharper images, which keeps this just shy of top-tier line work.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, dense with information, and generally do more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and character in tandem). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and controlled rather than purple; metaphors tend to extend the ocean/ice/connection motifs. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or clarity breaks, and both opening and closing lines are strong. The prose is lush enough that one or two images (“strings of pearls,” “oceans of love”) edge toward familiarity, but they do not materially dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“whispering parapet after rain,” “scintillatingly somber”). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and in-service, avoiding mixed metaphors or serious opacity. There is a slight tendency toward lushness and repeated coined phrases (“demure audacity,” “scintillatingly somber”) that flirt with preciousness, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur meaning. Overall line-level craft is comfortably at a publishable standard.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences are generally clean, varied, and purposeful; there’s little obvious scaffolding or redundancy, and the prose moves efficiently through the investigation. The expository section about the government project is functional but somewhat tell-heavy and less vivid than the scene-based passages. Figurative language is sparing and mostly apt, avoiding purple excess. Line-level craft is solid and publishable, though not yet exceptional in rhythm or compression.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense but mostly disciplined: images like “barnacle made of stone and glass” and “allegiance split like light through prisms” are vivid and thematically resonant. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most lines are doing double duty for atmosphere and character. While the style flirts with purple, metaphors generally cohere and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or filler scaffolds. Momentum holds through the lyricism, and the closing paragraph in particular lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, theme) without obvious redundancy, and rhythm varies enough to keep the piece from droning. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and internally coherent; phrases like “sweeten the air inside the glass with the right longing” are vivid rather than showy. I see little in the way of paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences, and the final paragraphs land crisply. A few lines verge on purple or overtly declarative theme, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and purposeful, with strong sensory images like “the ice sang back to her lighthouse in perfect sympathy” doing multiple jobs at once. There’s good syntactic variety and no evident scaffolding, repetition loops, or line-level confusion. A few phrases edge toward abstraction or slightly purple diction (“fleshly ethereal knowing,” “dissolved sorrows”) but they don’t obscure sense or momentum. Overall, line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor polish needed for maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors and purple excess; motifs like ice, light, and iron recur with purpose. There are very few redundancies or scaffold lines, and syntax varies enough to keep the piece from feeling mechanical. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only marginal room for micro-tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, economical, and generally high-density, with most lines doing double duty for plot and atmosphere (“the city’s underground arteries had swollen with rushing water” is illustrative and functional). Sentence variety and paragraphing support momentum, and there are no obvious loops, filler scaffolding, or muddled metaphors. A few explanatory sentences verge on tell (“Elena specialized in preventable deaths…”) but they are brief and strategically placed. The language in the closing beats remains clear and unencumbered, allowing the thematic image to land.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied rhythm, strong verbs, and images that generally do double duty (e.g., corrosion as both physical state and moral analogue). Figurative language is present but controlled; phrases like “vibrant hush” and “aggressive clarity” feel intentional and voice-consistent. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Nothing at the line level muddies causality or closure, and the final image is clear and well-framed.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense but controlled: sentences typically do multiple jobs at once, advancing world, character, and theme without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are generally coherent and on-theme, amplifying rather than muddling sense, and the rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. A few phrases flirt with purple (“structure, massive and turning, made of light and longing”), but they’re supported by prior imagery rather than appearing as gratuitous flourishes. Line-level craft is strong enough to support publication without substantial copyediting.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, generally concise, and carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) without bloat. Figurative language is vivid but not excessive, and there are no notable synonym loops or scaffolding phrases that stall momentum. Information density is high, especially in the middle investigative stretches, yet clarity remains intact. A few abstractions (“something vast and patient”) could be sharpened, but they do not harm closure or coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is tight, image-rich, and generally high-density: sentences usually advance world, character, and theme simultaneously without padding. Phrases like “emotional architecture beneath the present” flirt with abstraction but are anchored by concrete mirror images and specific vignettes, preserving clarity. Rhythm and syntax vary well, and there are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles dulling momentum or the final image. A touch more sensory variety or grounded embodiment at peak beats could push this higher, but the line-level craft is already strong enough for competitive markets.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, many carry dual loads of image and theme, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language (“holding water—present but aware of how easily everything could slip through”) is precise and coherent, supporting rather than obscuring sense. Information density is high without feeling crammed, and transitions between summary and scene are smooth. The prose doesn’t quite achieve a startlingly original music, but it is consistently graceful, clear, and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is controlled, with strong images (“autumn strip the vines of their last copper leaves,” “tears catching like dewdrops”) and generally good sentence rhythm without evident loops or scaffolding. Most lines do double duty—advancing scene while deepening mood—and the density suits the quiet, reflective frame. Figurative language is present but not so stacked as to become purple, and syntax varies enough to sustain momentum. A few abstract phrases and explicit theme articulations slightly blunt the otherwise sharp line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: lines are lean yet evocative, with imagery like “spaces that appeared between thoughts” and “whisperfield calm…like snow” doing multiple jobs at once. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and exposition tends to be woven into concrete action rather than bald explanation. The lyricism is controlled—metaphors are coherent and not overstacked, so clarity is never sacrificed. Momentum is appropriately measured for the mode but not stagnant.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, description is dense without becoming muddled, and figurative language mostly serves both atmosphere and theme. Phrases like beams “like broken teeth” and “parents wore defeat like ill-fitting coats” are familiar but effective and don’t stack into purple overload. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy; most lines add new texture or move the scene. A touch more restraint in overt thematic phrasing could elevate the prose further into top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, purposeful, and generally carry multiple functions (image, emotion, and idea at once) without slipping into purple excess. Figurative language (pressed flowers, buildings that sing, language shedding skin) is coherent and thematically aligned, with minimal redundancy. There are a few moments of abstract phrasing, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, rich in information, and most metaphors pull real weight rather than decorating. The prose sustains density without collapsing into purple; images like “magnetic tape unspooling from forgotten cassettes” and “creak of joints becoming architecture” are both fresh and functional. There is little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic monotony, and the final image lands cleanly. At an elite bar, a few moments could be pared to sharpen impact, but there are no significant artifacts or muddled figures to undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops; most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or character plus theme). Metaphors are coherent and on-theme (clockwork heart, escape velocity, foundations shaking) without piling up to the point of distraction, and rhythm feels curated rather than mechanical. Syntax and paragraphing create a smooth flow from technical detail to emotional realization, especially around the restructuring sequence and the closing paragraphs. I see no significant line-level artifacts, redundancies, or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong images like “gather and concentrate, pulsing with a stillness” and “hymning of mundane moments.” Sentences do multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. The figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to obscure clarity or feel purple. Line-level control holds through the ending image, which lands cleanly and memorably.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are generally concise, varied, and purposeful; there are no major loops, mixed metaphors, or clarity issues. Images like “tethered to nothing but ancient equations and stubborn faith” and “luminous threads that connected every object to every other” are strong without becoming purple. There’s minor repetition of conceptual phrasing (loops, circuits, relearning) but it functions as motif more than scaffold. Overall, the prose is smooth and above-average, though not yet dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and efficient, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (advancing plot while deepening character or atmosphere) and a good rhythmic mix of long, winding lines and shorter punches. Imagery like "certainty cracked open like an egg" and the tooth "warm as a star being born" is vivid without tipping into incoherence; figurative density is high but not confusing. There are few, if any, scaffold or paraphrase loops, and syntax remains clean and readable. A couple of lines approach thematic exposition rather than scene, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong verb choices and multi-tasking sentences that advance setting, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and well-matched to the maritime/celestial palette; it rarely tips into muddle or redundancy. There is little scaffolding, minimal repetition, and clean syntax; the story reads smoothly aloud. A slight tendency toward density in places (“zephyr bloom—that precise moment…”) prevents it from feeling utterly effortless at the elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a good ratio of image to information. Phrases like “honeyed hush” and “garden of transformed failure” flirt with purple but are grounded by concrete sensory detail and do not accumulate into muddle. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and most sentences do at least two jobs (world-building plus emotion or theme). A touch more restraint in the final paragraph’s abstractions could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but generally do more than one job, carrying atmosphere and interior movement together. Figurative language (“moving against the current of dissolution,” “inside the whisper of closing pages”) is consistent and legible rather than mixed or showy. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and rhythm is varied enough to maintain momentum through a reflective piece. A few metaphoric phrases land close to thematic statement, but they don’t blur sense or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong verbs, precise sensory images, and a good balance between description and movement; most sentences are doing multiple jobs (setting, emotion, world-building) without bloat. Lyricism is present but generally disciplined, and there are few, if any, redundant lines or paraphrase loops. Rhythm varies well across longer descriptive sentences and shorter, punchier lines when the music begins and the environment responds. A slight tendency toward lushness keeps it just shy of exceptional minimalism, but nothing obscures clarity or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally excellent: sentences are rhythmic, specific, and information-dense, often doing several jobs at once (world-building, mood, and character all in a line). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and thematically aligned—light, memory, and mapping recur in disciplined ways rather than as random ornament. There are a few lines that edge toward purple or conceptual redundancy (e.g., closely clustered abstractions like “geography of persistence, cartography of hope”), but they don’t materially obscure sense or dull the closure. Line-level momentum is well maintained for a meditative piece, with little scaffolding or looped phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean and purposeful, with strong information density—sentences often do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, and theme) without padding. Imagery such as “Reflections bloomed across the stone like flowers opening” is vivid but not overstacked, and rhythms vary well between exposition and peak beats. There are minimal redundancies or scaffold phrases, and syntax remains transparent even in more lyrical moments. A slight tendency toward abstract phrasing in a few lines is the only minor drag on otherwise publishable line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but generally efficient: most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and thematic charge) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Rhythm varies well between longer lyric constructions and tighter, declarative lines (e.g., “The burdens began arriving at twilight.”), which helps momentum. Metaphor stacking is heavy but mostly coherent and thematically linked to repetition, filtration, and mineralization, avoiding true purple or mixed metaphors. There are no significant clarity issues, though an elite-market edit might trim a couple of the most baroque phrases to sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and economical, with most sentences doing double duty for image and emotion. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent; motifs (amber, rings, lenses, aquarium light) reinforce each other rather than clashing. Repetition (e.g., “Here and gone, here and gone”) is purposeful rather than a paraphrase loop. I see no line-level artifacts or clarity lapses that blunt the closure image of the translucent bowl in rain-filtered light.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is polished: images like “kinetic lagoon,” “fractured stillness,” and “regret tasted like cloud-mist” are vivid and consistent with the world’s logic. Most sentences pull multiple weights (setting, mood, interiority) without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. There is a high density of figurative language, but it maintains coherence and doesn’t collapse into mixed metaphors or purple murk. A touch more variation between metaphor and plainer statement in a few mid-paragraph lines could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors (ghost rivers of purpose, shadow infrastructure) are apt and coherent, and the prose largely avoids redundancy or scaffold. A couple of phrases (“functionally creative in the way only desperate optimism allowed”) lean a bit abstract, but they do not materially slow momentum or blur sense. The final image is clean and un-muddled, with no notable artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images are generally precise, and most lines do double duty for mood and character. Figurative language is frequent but usually apt and controlled (“water droplets…like suspended time,” “petrichor nostalgia”), avoiding mixed metaphors. There is minimal redundancy and no significant scaffold or synonym churning that slows momentum. A couple of phrases (“excruciatingly gentle morning”) flirt with purple but do not materially dull clarity or the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, and key images (glowing canal, emerging diagrams, blueprints in water) are cleanly conveyed. There is some conceptual redundancy around “architecture of lies,” misdirection, and perspective that could be tightened without loss. Figurative language is sparing and mostly precise, avoiding purple prose. Rhythm supports the gradual escalation of awe and the quiet settling of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and high-density: most sentences perform multiple functions (advancing action, worldbuilding, and theme) without padding, and the metaphors—seeds as “nature’s own form of knotwork,” the knots as a “rosetta stone”—are fresh and coherent. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and grammar and sequencing are clean. The figurative texture is rich but stops short of purple; images recur with variation rather than excess. A slight tendency toward consistent lyric elevation keeps it from feeling razor-sharp under pressure, but the line-level craft is firmly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are precise, and most metaphors extend the core motifs instead of piling on. Phrases like “its lanterns fading into the fog like dying stars” and “a landscape of lonesome splendor” feel earned and tonally aligned. There’s a high density of figurative language, but it rarely tips into purple or redundancy, and information moves forward efficiently. No significant scaffolding, loops, or clarity issues drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, often doing double duty by advancing action while layering atmosphere (“salvaged memory cores,” “quaking reverie,” “colors that had no names in the modern technical vocabularies”). Figurative language generally feels precise and thematically grounded rather than ornamental. Information density is high without obvious loops or scaffolding, and sentences vary in structure and length to modulate pace. A few lines lean into conceptual abstraction, but they do not significantly blur clarity or stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, imagistic, and purposeful, with good information density and few wasted moves; images like “reverse stars” and “kelp-drift peace” are memorable. There is some tendency toward purple or redundant phrasing and explicit thematic summation, especially in the closing sentences, which slightly dulls the impact of otherwise potent images. Figurative language mostly holds together logically, without mixed metaphors that break immersion. Trimming a few overt statements and repeated formulations would sharpen momentum and leave the images to do more of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with many sentences carrying multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character insight at once (“lantern that cast more questions than light” is exemplary). There’s some repetition of constructions (“perhaps…perhaps…”) and a mild tendency toward lushness, but it rarely bogs momentum or confuses sense. Figurative language is generally coherent and apt, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding artifacts. It’s strong, publishable line work, just shy of the extraordinary compression and surprise that would push it into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, largely lean, and often do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is mostly precise and not over-stacked, and there is little in the way of redundancy or scaffolding. Key images (brass gear, blooming nebulae, “impossible light”) are clear and memorable, carrying through to the ending without muddle. There is some mild tendency toward elevated diction that edges on purple, but it rarely impairs clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: rich imagery (“thundering calm,” “pools of copper light”) serves both atmosphere and theme without tipping into incoherence. Sentences vary in rhythm, and most lines do double duty—advancing mood and concept simultaneously. There’s some density of figurative language, but it rarely feels purple or redundant, and key beats are rendered clearly. Trimming a few expository clarifications of theme would make the prose even leaner and more propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and metaphors that mostly reinforce rather than clutter the central images (calcified finger, heavy as guilt, invisible history). There’s minimal redundancy and no serious clarity issues. The prose leans rich, but the figurative language forms a coherent pattern around time, inscription, and tide rather than feeling like purple adornment.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, imagistic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for character and atmosphere (“its small red flag drooping like a confession of defeat”). Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and not so dense as to obscure sense; there are no metaphor tangles or obvious scaffolding/loop artifacts. Pacing remains smooth, with reflection interwoven into action rather than halting it. A slightly heavy reliance on simile/metaphor in some paragraphs keeps this just shy of the very top band for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean and rhythmic, with varied syntax and a good balance of image and abstraction (“reflecting the pale winter sky in fractured shards of light” is representative). Information is dense but mostly efficient; technical details about sensors and circuitry do double duty for worldbuilding and theme. There are moments of minor conceptual redundancy (rephrasing the same thematic idea about ignorance and innovation) that could be tightened, but they don’t seriously drag momentum. Figurative language remains coherent and unstrained, and the final paragraphs land with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is tight: most sentences are doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) and read smoothly aloud, with only occasional mild purple leanings. Metaphors are generally coherent and apt, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or filler scaffolds. The prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism, and the final paragraphs land on a clean, charged image. The only thing keeping this from the top band is that some figurative moves feel familiar and the pressure never demands maximal compression or sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and purposeful, with metaphors (vanishing edges, ash as faith) that align cleanly with the core concept. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase-looping, and almost every line does double duty for atmosphere and theme. A few abstractions cluster near the end, but they don’t obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clear, rhythmic, and economical; most sentences carry at least two jobs (world, character, theme) without feeling overworked. The recurring imagery of layers, cogs, and drowned foundations builds texture without sliding into purple prose, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. A few lines edge toward essayistic abstraction, but overall the line-level craft supports momentum and leaves the closure image clean.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, theme) and rhythm varies well, especially in the opening and closing. Figurative language is mostly precise and consistent (“leaves…like illuminated manuscripts,” “noise of assumptions”), with little outright purple flourish. There is some conceptual repetition around vanishing arts and harmony that could be trimmed for even sharper momentum, and a couple of lines verge on slogan-like abstraction. Still, clarity remains high and the final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences are clean, mostly well-paced, and information-dense without obvious scaffolding or loops; the prose rarely idles. Imagery is concrete and pointed—the repeated rust/greenhouse/fruit visuals all earn their keep. A few phrases veer toward tag-line neatness (“packaging nostalgia into branded experiences,” “making something beautiful from what they tried to destroy”), which can feel pre-fabricated rather than freshly seen. Overall, momentum and clarity stay strong, with no significant figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful, with strong images like “beautifully wasteful with their information” and “elaborate death” doing thematic double duty. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the prose moves efficiently through scene and exposition. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked; rhythm reads smoothly aloud. The main limitation is occasional didactic phrasing that flattens otherwise vivid texture.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are precise, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly well-controlled and coherent, rarely tipping into purple; phrases like “caught in their dreaming state between utility and decoration” earn their keep. Information density is high—most lines advance both atmosphere and character—and the piece reads smoothly aloud. A few abstract phrases (“constant noise of existence”) are minor soft spots but don’t materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and figurative language (“threading revelations through the structural weaknesses in her certainty”) that does double thematic and narrative duty. There’s little to no scaffolding or synonym churn; nearly every line advances character, world, or theme. A handful of abstractions and repeated constructions around “nuance,” “certainty,” and “understanding” slightly dull the edge in places. Overall, momentum and clarity remain excellent, and the final image is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is controlled and efficient: most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, interiority, and theme) without bloat, and rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and metaphors (e.g., proofs as musical notation, the staircase as perpetual motion) are coherent and extended rather than mixed. There are no obvious paraphrase loops or syntactic templates that sap momentum, and the final paragraph is tight and impactful. A couple of explanatory phrases in dialogue could be trimmed for even more density, but they don’t significantly drag the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished: high information density, minimal scaffolding, strong verbs, and carefully chosen metaphors that largely avoid muddle (“smog curl through the city below like toxic amber,” “moon like a coin pressed against dirty cloth”). Sentences vary in length and rhythm, supporting the meditative but forward-moving feel of the night’s work. Figurative language is frequent but purposeful, usually doing double duty for mood and theme without bogging the line. I find no significant loops or artifacts that dull the closure; the final paragraphs are clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are compact yet layered, with images doing double duty for mood and theme. Figurative language is mostly precise and original; “rosewater dread” and “fractures spread like hope through ice” are standout moments that don’t overreach. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding—each paragraph advances situation, character, or atmosphere. Rhythm supports the quiet build rather than flattening into a single cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but efficient: most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and advancing the speculative mechanism). Figurative language is strong and largely unmuddled, with images like “Light poured from it, not outward but inward, pulling reality toward itself like water circling a drain” both clear and striking. There’s no evident synonym churn, scaffold, or repetitive cadence; the line-level craft supports momentum into the closure image. A couple of high-level abstractions (“bleak exhilaration,” “fate’s design”) are offset by enough concrete detail to keep the piece grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level work is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, metaphors are mostly precise and thematically relevant, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. Many lines do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and internal state (e.g., the curse rendering every reflection inescapably permanent). Figurative density is high but controlled; it rarely muddies sense or momentum. A few images (“smile was a wound opening,” “haunted…since before Margot was born”) lean on familiar gothic phrasing, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing double duty for world, character, and mood; rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. Recurrent terms (fractal, resonance, leeward tide) form a coherent lexicon rather than a loop, and mixed metaphors are avoided. There is a mild tendency toward repeated explanatory phrasing (“sketched itself across her awareness,” then similar later), but it doesn’t materially drag or obscure. The final paragraph lands with clarity and a clean, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and images that often carry both worldbuilding and emotional charge (“shadow-water,” “sunwashed air with something like grief”). There is minimal redundancy and no obvious template cadence or metaphor muddle; exposition is generally efficient and purposeful. A couple of lines tell what’s already implicit (“That was the city’s true danger…”) and slightly blunt the otherwise sharp imagery, but momentum and clarity remain intact. The final paragraph lands cleanly without purple overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is clean, grammatically sound, and generally concise, with several strong images (“ivy had claimed every surface,” “between past and present, truth was finally blooming into light”). Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most lines do multiple jobs (setting, mood, theme). There is some reliance on familiar formulations and mild abstraction (“emotionally rational understanding,” “rescue truth from a pit of lies”) that nudges toward expository summary rather than pure scene. Still, there are no major loops or artifacts, and momentum is well maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors are frequent but generally precise and thematically aligned (water’s patience, architecture as memory), and they don’t significantly obscure clarity or momentum. There are no real loops or scaffolding lines; exposition is compressed efficiently. A slight tendency toward lushness (“hushed blaze quality”) nudges the edge of purple but doesn’t meaningfully blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and information-dense, with description doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Sentences are varied and clean, with no major loops or scaffolding artifacts. Occasionally, language veers toward the slightly purple or self-conscious (“water-pressed wisdom,” repeated “tranquilly perceptive”), but it remains coherent and readable. Line-level craft is strong, just shy of the exceptional sharpness and compression needed for the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but generally efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion, and only occasional flirtations with purple (“luminous torment”) that feel intentional rather than indulgent. Figurative language is coherent and thematically aligned, and there are no significant synonym loops or scaffold phrases dragging momentum. Sentence rhythms vary, avoiding mechanical cadences while supporting the meditative tone. Line-level clarity remains high even in the more conceptually rich passages about paradoxical physics and dream-gems.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple jobs (image, theme, character), and rarely feel redundant. Key metaphors (geode/potential, aurora as “wedding veils catching fire”) are vivid and coherent, and the prose largely avoids purple excess despite operating in a lyrical register. There is some repetition of abstract terms like “potential” and “perturbation,” but not to the point of loopiness or drag. Information flows clearly without scaffoldy exposition or noticeable template cadences.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, purposeful, and often multitask (worldbuilding, character, and theme at once), and the “brilliant dimness” motif is handled with pleasing concision. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and the rhythm supports the contemplative, mythic tenor of the piece. Some metaphors are familiar (“pulsed like forgotten messages”) and the prose occasionally leans on abstract labels instead of fresh sensory specifics, especially in thematic exposition. Still, no major artifacts or muddled figures impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Occasional purple-leaning lines (“sand mixed with salt and sorrow”) and repeated lexical motifs (“weight,” “driftwood”) are mostly effective as pattern rather than redundancy. There are no significant loops, scaffolding, or syntactic artifacts that slow momentum or obscure sense. A stricter pruning of a few explanatory sentences would elevate the line-level craft further.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-constructed, rhythm varies, and description often does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character). Figurative language like “stone ribbon fraying at the edges” and “ghost between worlds” is effective and not overstacked. There is some mild conceptual redundancy (neutral/liminal territory explained more than once), but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum. Overall, the prose is polished and clear, though it stops short of being unmistakably distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty with image and emotion (“expectations collapse like a sandcastle meeting tide”). Figurative language is controlled and coherent; extended metaphors of navigation and collapse are woven rather than stacked. There’s minimal scaffold or repetition, and the prose sustains momentum without bloated exposition. A few phrases are slightly writerly, but they don’t obscure sense or dampen the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally polished, with varied sentence rhythm and strong images (“ancient yet trembling with fragile life”). Description and exposition are compact enough that momentum never stalls, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or clunky scaffolding. A couple of phrases (“delicately robust,” “the weight of failed hope”) flirt with the generic or purple, but they don’t materially blur sense or cadence. Line-level craft is above-average and publication-ready, even if not strikingly original in every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, images are generally precise (“cinnamon that burned cold,” “saffron threads that glowed like captured sunset”), and almost every line carries atmosphere or character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent with the world’s altered physics. There’s minimal redundancy and no significant scaffolding or synonym loops that drag momentum. A few phrases (“cosmic intimacy,” “paradoxically steady”) are slightly abstract, but they don’t obscure action or emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and high-density, with most sentences doing double duty for image and emotion (“Everything here hurt in the way that truth hurts, gorgeous and unforgiving.”). Figurative language is frequent but rarely feels overwrought or mixed, and there’s little to no scaffolding, synonym churn, or repetitive stems. A couple of lines approach purple or didactic, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—sentences typically serve character, worldbuilding, and theme at once, and the imagery around salt crystals and “luminous emptiness” is striking. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; the piece moves efficiently from setup to climax. The figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, with only occasional abstraction that could be grounded more in concrete sensation at the climax. No significant loops or artifacts impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most do multiple jobs (advancing scene, character, and theme). Occasional abstractions and minor paraphrase (“She was no longer the philanthropist…but neither was she merely destitute”) risk slight redundancy, and a few lines tilt toward essayistic summary. Figurative language is generally clear and grounded, with no mixed metaphors or density overload that muddies closure. Overall, the prose is strong, but a light tightening of thematic statements would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clear, largely free of redundancy, and balances description with forward motion; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus tone, or character plus plot). Figurative language is controlled and not overstacked, and there are no obvious mixed metaphors or syntactic train-wrecks. A few lines drift toward on-the-nose summary (“The revolution won't be loud…”) rather than trusting image and action, slightly dulling the ending’s edge. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publishable but not yet strikingly compressed or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with most sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to become purple or muddled, and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops. Key beats (the rock placements, the eels rising, the final stone) are rendered cleanly without syntactic clutter. Minor abstraction in a couple of thematic lines slightly reduces immediacy but doesn’t materially harm momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, imagery is generally clean, and most lines do multiple jobs (character, atmosphere, theme) without padding. A few phrases flirt with over-articulation or conceptual redundancy (“her words had been blackened by bureaucratic ink,” then later explicit theorizing about resistance and truth), but they don’t significantly stall momentum. Metaphors are largely coherent and well-chosen, and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts. The prose is lush yet remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong, economical images (“afternoon light in fractured beams,” “cathedral of questions without answers, destinations without maps”) and minimal redundancy. Sentences often do double duty—advancing action while reinforcing character or theme—without bogging down in purple description. Figurative language is generally coherent and controlled; there are no major loops, scaffolding, or cadence artifacts. A few lines edge toward over-explanation of theme, but they don’t significantly damage momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, dense with meaning, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors (“roof peeled back like a sardine can,” “voices in her head grew too numerous to contain”) are vivid and coherent, rarely tipping into purple. Information is efficiently packed—backstory and world-building are compressed into charged images rather than exposition blocks. There are almost no loops or filler lines; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, largely tight, and often do double duty (world-building plus emotional shading). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (compasses, tides, frames, clocks), with few mixed metaphors or redundancies. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; exposition is economical and woven into action. The only restraint on a higher score is that density of imagery in places flirts with purple, which may slightly blur rather than sharpen a few moments of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with few redundancies. Figurative language (“steam rising like small prayers,” “empirically whimsical”) is mostly fresh and purposeful rather than ornamental. There is slight drift toward overtly declarative phrasing at thematic peaks, but it doesn’t obscure clarity or momentum. Overall, the prose supports both atmosphere and character with minimal scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions (image, theme, character), and maintain clarity despite frequent figurative language. Metaphors are coherent with the established palette (tides, stone, ink, blue) and do not stack to the point of muddling sense. There’s very little scaffold or redundancy, and both opening and closing images are composed with care. The density of lyricism approaches the upper limit before feeling precious but largely stays on the right side.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and strong imagery ("glowed like stars," "tiny mirror"). The connection between the macro (stars) and micro (scales) is handled with linguistic precision. A slight reliance on summary descriptors for emotions in the latter half ("kindled humility") prevents a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally competent but relies on worn clichés ("held its breath," "tapestry of stars") that dull the opening impact. The information density is good, though the phrasing occasionally drifts into abstraction ("drifting resonance") to accommodate prompt requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence-level craft is polished and rhythmic, but the reliance on summary necessitates a high degree of "telling" rather than "showing." The prose is functional and clear, though marred slightly by stock phrasing ("ravaged the coast," "clinging to debris") and the didactic nature of the exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong sensory anchors in the opening. However, the reliance on genre clichés like "time flowed strangely" and "impossible geometry" to explain away plot mechanics prevents the writing from reaching the highest tier of freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is functional but marred by abstractions ("hope deferred," "fragile dignity") and clichés ("tightened like a noose"). The rhythm is smooth, but the lack of concrete imagery in key moments softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and evocative, though occasionally reliant on abstract modifiers ("impossible balance," "foggy lucidity") and "as [phrase]" constructions that slightly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally evocative and rhythmically sound ("stone skipping across water"). However, the phrase "hands trembling in quaking reverie" creates a tautological stumble during a pivotal beat, slightly marring the climax's precision.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished but relies on several clichés ("dust motes danced," "single shaft of moonlight") that reduce freshness. The description of the key arrangement remains abstract ("chaos" vs. "pattern") rather than providing the concrete visual detail needed to sell the puzzle's solution.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush, rhythmic, and high-density, effectively conveying the synesthetic experience. A few phrases lean toward the generic ("tears froze on Mira's cheeks") or explicit hand-holding ("like trust itself"), which prevents a top-tier score, but the line-level craft is otherwise immediately publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally polished with some nice imagery ("pooled thick as honey"), but the forced insertion of the prompt phrase ("quietly savvy understanding bloom") creates a jarring syntactical artifact in a crucial sentence. The reliance on label-noun pairings ("luminous disbelief") slightly flattens the emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mechanically sound, but the prose suffers from "adjective/adverb stuffing" and abstract phrasing ("thoughtfully spirited," "weighty lightness"). The writing aims for poetic lyricism but often lands on overwrought sentiment ("kissing glass," "surrendering to spring"), which obscures the raw emotional reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is functional but marred by abstractions ("adaptive survival instincts") and convenience transitions ("suddenly"). The "dying beast" imagery borders on purple prose, and the pacing drags during the phone exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from noticeable lexical repetition within a short space ("flaking" x3, "marbled" x2, "hush" x2, plus "ambered"). While the imagery is strong, these echoes suggest a need for a polish pass to vary descriptors. The dialogue occasionally feels functional rather than natural.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with clear imagery and good momentum. A few descriptors lean toward generic sci-fi lyricism ("impossibly whole," "static"), but the line-level craft is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is fluid and atmospherically dense. There are minor filter verbs ("She recognized," "Mira saw") that distance the reader slightly in key moments. The final sentence is a scaffold summary that explains the theme, which detracts from the otherwise strong "show" of the hand-holding beat.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Imagery is generally evocative ("caught the light like broken teeth," "creasing like bark"). The score is held back slightly by a few conventional similes ("dawning like light through leaves") and the tell-y label "wisely pragmatic," but the overall rhythm and density are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from noticeable repetition of prompt phrases ("mechanically warm," "subdued awakenings," "obliging mechanic") which appear verbatim multiple times. This looping creates a scaffolded feel that disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is polished but marred by significant physical impossibilities presented as profound (a submerged cello would not be "more resonant"; it would be mute and warped). Vague descriptors like "strange new patterns" and "something else entirely" weaken the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.3)
    The distinctive phrase "auroral sorrow" is repeated twice (once in a dialogue tag, once in narration), creating a noticeable text loop (-0.6). Some abstract telling ("grief and hope intermingled") dilutes the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.5)
    Line-level execution is significantly hampered by unpatterned repetition; "swallowed truth" appears four times and "drowsy alertness" twice in a short space, creating a loop/scaffold effect that drags on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is rhythmic but suffers from repetitive phrasing, including three uses of "regenerative silence" and five variations of "crumble." These artifacts, along with abstract sentence subjects, dull the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but overly reliant on abstract metaphors ("wonder lived in subtle frequencies," "pocket of possibility") that tell rather than show. There is a lack of muscularity in the key beats, with the writing leaning into safe, adjectival descriptions ("delicate curl," "fragile emergence") rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from adverb-heavy telling ("sensitively perceptive," "carefully," "barely," "suddenly") that clutters the rhythm. The phrase "bronze quiet" is repeated as a bookend but feels repetitive in such a short space. Phrasing like "last human dream had been dreamt" leans into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is distinct and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("calcified him," "crispy shells that cracked"). Line-level craft is high, though the momentum drags during the substantial backstory reflection in the middle of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, mirroring the looping mechanics of the story. However, it relies occasionally on clichés ("plumbed the depths") and somewhat overwrought metaphors ("origami made of light") that can feel ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "visual symphony frozen in calcium carbonate." Some metaphors lean towards the conventional ("translucent finger," "sentinel"), but the line-level craft generally supports the story's elevated tone.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is propulsive and rhythmically sound, with high information density. Reliance on stock adjective-noun pairings ("defiant rays," "dying sun") and the "noun-and-abstract-noun" structure prevents higher marks.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the prose has rhythm, it relies on "telling" emotional states ("suffocating layer," "determined expression") and occasional overwriting ("whisper seeping") that blunts the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and readable but relies on stock phrasing ("meticulous precision," "gentle murmur," "practiced fingers," "gathering darkness"). While clarity is high and the pacing is smooth, the line-level craft lacks the freshness or friction required for the highest bands. The technical vocabulary provides the best moments of specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative, but marred slightly by repetitive phrasing ("crystal" appears three times in prominent positions) and occasional sentimental abstractions ("heart recognized completely," "raw core") that tell rather than show the emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished with high information density ("molecules aligned by terror") and strong rhythm. A few abstract phrases ("slipping through probability") drift into generic sci-fi description, but line-level craft is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is evocative with high information density and strong sensory rhythms ("sideways apple trees," "iron ribs"). Minor filter verbs ("She realized," "she noticed") occasionally distance the reader from the immediate experience, but the imagery remains sharp and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally exquisite, with high-density imagery like "holding them like cupped hands around flame." However, a significant grammatical error ("The resin had subsume") and a slightly jarring tense shift in a thought tag ("As the transformation completes, she thought") disrupt the otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is polished but suffers from cliché ("pooled like spilled milk") and abstract telling ("thick with meaning"). Adverb-adjective clusters like "whimsically attentive" dilute the immediacy of the action. The writing is functional but lacks the density and freshness required for the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from "purple" overwriting and repetitive modifier strings ("frozen starlight," "luminescent longing," "shimmering crater"). The density of abstract metaphors ("frequencies beyond the murmur of lost languages") occasionally obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong and lyrical ("silk made of memory"), with good rhythmic variance. A few stock phrases ("slowed to syrup") and slightly adjective-heavy descriptions prevent it from reaching the highest bands, but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("silver milk") and weaker constructions ("literally and figuratively"). The use of abstract nouns in action beats ("equations that dovetailed...") slightly muddles the line-level causality.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("kindly methodical precision," "grinding mechanical whine") and filter verbs that distance the action. There is a tendency to "tell" emotional states ("triggered something profound") rather than evoking them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong rhythm and sensory details ("scent of approaching rain"). However, the heavy use of expository summary slows the momentum, and some phrasings (e.g., "metamorphosis had been reluctant") feel slightly abstract compared to the vividness of the garden imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    Imagery is vivid and precise ("branching like neurons," "face a map of thirst"), supporting the density required for this length. The prose maintains good momentum, though the phrase "wryly earnest" lands a bit clunky as an adverb-adjective cluster.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without stalling momentum. Phrases like "shadows grew teeth" and "steadily unpredictable" (a required element) are woven naturally into the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with a strong opening. There are minor "purple" tendencies ("gleaming like promises kept") and some hedging ("Hope, perhaps, or something more complicated") that soften the impact of specific images.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with adjectival padding and abstract metaphors ("contract written in starlight," "fractal complexity"). The rhythm is good, but the density of figurative language sometimes obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but leans heavily on abstract nouns ("meaning," "intimacy," "truth") to convey emotion rather than concrete particulars. The repetition of "sculpt space for reflection" works as a structural frame but the internal summary creates some drag.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Filter verbs ("Cassius felt," "he could see") repeatedly distance the reader from the sensory experience in key moments. While rhythmically competent, the prose relies on standard genre phrasing ("writhing serpents," "impossible geometries") that dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is generally polished with high information density ("liquefied rigid thinking," "conscripted for fraud"). A few similes lean on proximity-based clichés ("steady as a heart monitor's flat line," "pale as the corpse"), which prevents the highest band, but the line-level momentum is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("cardboard cover worn soft as cloth"). However, the verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("earnestly studious," "incandescent restraint") reads as artificial telling rather than organic description, slightly disrupting the otherwise high-quality craft.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. The transition between the industrial reality and the reconstructed memory is handled with lyrical precision ("fragments of erased histories"). Line-level craft supports the story's melancholic intensity without lapsing into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is competent but relies on stock phrasing ("forgotten promise," "last threads of twilight") and adjective stacking ("mournful, warbling note"). There is a tendency toward "writerly" descriptions that prioritize sound over precision, and the explicit decoding of the central metaphor in the narration creates a sense of redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic on the sentence level. However, the heavy use of filter verbs and summary telling ("That's when Marina decided," "She felt the hopeful desperation") drags on the momentum and reduces immediate immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative ("sky pearled toward dawn"). There are minor lapses into "telling" emotions ("purposefully curious gaze") and a slightly cliché simile ("understanding bloomed like the moonflowers"). The rhythm effectively supports the building tension.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is fluid and rhythmic but leans into overwriting with slightly decorative metaphors ("breath through lungs," "cathedral silence"). While technically proficient, the density of adjectives and "poetic" phrasing sometimes softens the scene's immediacy. The craft is solid but lacks the muscular economy preferred for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant prose artifacts: the phrases "worrying tranquility" and "subtly confident" are repeated verbatim within a short span, signaling a lack of revision. These loops distract from the imagery and break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished but leans on sentimental abstractions ("frequency of hope," "resonance of grief") that blur concrete imagery. These metaphorical labels act as shortcuts for emotional depth rather than earning it through specific detail.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("crystallized and preserved"). However, the forced integration of prompt phrases into dialogue ("By overriding instinct") creates a jarring artifact that disrupts the scene's momentum and naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally evocative but occasionally leans into purple abstraction ("walls thick with... regret," "air itself was learning to hover"). There is visible repetition of key phrases ("sustains impossibilities," "copper light") that feels slightly mechanical rather than rhythmic. A few filter verbs ("he could see," "he heard") distance the reader during high-sensory moments.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally polished but stumbles into redundancy ("appeared... through ephemeral cameo appearances") and cliché ("dropped like a stone"). While the imagery is consistent, the sentence-level craft often tells rather than shows, particularly with emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and lyrical, with high information density in descriptions ("silk threads that caught the dawn light like veins of precious metal"). A few phrases veer into abstraction ("grammar of possibility"), but the line-level craft generally supports the ethereal tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished and functional but leans on clichés ("drifting down like snow," "hollow weight") that dull the imagery. While technically clean, the line-level craft lacks the freshness and density required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished, with strong imagery ("amber glass ceiling") and good momentum. The phrase "carefully inventive" appears twice in a way that feels like a scaffold for prompt requirements, but the general line-level craft is high with no major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and no significant scaffolding artifacts. Phrases like "adjacent possibilities" and "sentinel against the autumn wind" add texture without slowing momentum. Minor stock phrasings ("gnarled fingers," "thin smile") prevent a higher score, but the line-level craft is otherwise precise and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("writing themselves in backwards script"). However, there is a tendency toward adjective-heavy telling ("grief-hollowed," "fierce tenderness," "liminal space") where concrete action would be stronger. Some similes, like roots as "arthritic fingers," feel slightly familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally polished with high density and strong sensory details, such as the "smudged... anxious fingers." However, the forced integration of specific prompt phrases ("lotus-hearted," "grafting new meaning") creates a slight rhythmic drag and feels less organic than the surrounding text.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. Imagery is generally strong, though "cracked like exposed film" is technically imprecise (film doesn't crack from sun exposure alone) and "fold of a daydream" leans slightly purple.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally lucid, but relies on a few stock similes ("lodged... like a splinter," "nested like Russian dolls") that dampen freshness. The repetition of the tag "methodically playful" functions as a frame but feels slightly mechanical rather than deepening the trait.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally polished and readable, with moments of strong imagery ("light through flawed glass"). However, it suffers from some adjective/adverb clutter ("candidly cryptic," "deliberate obscurity") and occasional clichés ("roguish expression," "defiant flowers") that flatten the texture during key character beats.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though it occasionally tilts toward being overwrought with dense metaphorical stacking ("photosynthesized into beauty," "reef-shadow joy"). Line-level mechanics are clean, and the sentence variety creates a pleasant, lullaby-like cadence that matches the subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, though the density of figurative language in the final third ("questions without answers," "frozen music") borders on overwrought for a strict literary standard. However, the line-level craft is generally superb, with strong rhythm and no wasted motion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and flows well, with strong verbs like "unsnarl." There is a slight redundancy in descriptive phrasing ("carefully reckless abandon" and "cautious exuberance" are spatially close and structurally similar), but the line-level craft is otherwise distinct and controls the pacing effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the sentence rhythm is generally good, the prose suffers from significant lexical looping. Distinct phrases like "dappled resolve," "encrypted compassion," and "trembled" are repeated verbatim or with slight variation within a short space, creating a formulaic echo effect that mars the polish.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density ("trust was a pigeon released into storm clouds"). Minor repetition of "dust" and "swirling" across paragraphs 5, 8, and 12 creates a slight textural drag, but line-level propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled with high information density. Images like "oak rings compressed by decades" efficiently bridge the physical and the thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.0)
    "Excitement captivating her voice" is awkward phrasing that misuses the verb. The prose tends toward purple descriptors like "shadowseam wonder" and "softly ingenious" that tell the reader how to feel rather than showing the quality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is competent and clear, but relies on some stock imagery ("dissolved like sugar in water") and compound adjectives ("joy-soaked," "salt-bitter"). Rhythm is solid, but the reliance on similes to explain abstract concepts ("smooth as memory itself") dilutes the immediacy of the vision scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative without wasted motion; phrases like "luggage-handle calluses" and "shark-eyed hustler" provide high information density. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the "orchestrated chaos" of the scene, accelerating appropriately during the chess match.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from "adjective-noun" overloading ("obsidian grace," "invisible currents"), creating a slightly purple texture. The required phrase "moonstone cabochon dust speck" is inserted as a clumsy, rhythmic stumbling block that disrupts the sentence's flow.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished but leans on clichés ("colors that had no names," "breath on glass") and metaphor stacks ("language of wave and particle"). The rhythm is smooth, but the imagery often prioritizes poetic sounding phrases over fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished but marred by significant clichés and borrowed phrasing (the "light gets in" line). The reliance on abstract phrases ("hard softness") weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence-level craft is competent but suffers from telling and filtering ("Mira felt," "She understood then"). The required phrase "serene upheaval" is inserted awkwardly as a noun phrase ("The serene upheaval of the moment"), disrupting the rhythm. There is a tendency toward adjective-noun padding ("tide-polished," "lucidly watchful") that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is functional with some strong images ("ghost-pressure of thousands of hands"), but suffers from filter verbs ("She realized," "She thought of") that distance the reader. Occasional clichés ("roots that cracked stone like paper") and expository shorthand reduce the information density and immediacy expected at the highest literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished but leans toward overwriting ("surrendered to spring's warming breath") and whimsical abstraction ("pigments made from crushed prisms"). These flourishes occasionally distance the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally dense and rhythmic ("deliberately calibrated to disarm"). The simile "silence settled like snow" feels slightly stock in an otherwise precise text, but the line-level craft remains high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.2)
    Two glaring errors ("a eccentric," "at this exact coordinates") and occasional clichés ("dense as grief") disqualify the prose from the "flawless" standard required for immediate publication. These artifacts break immersion in an otherwise polished text.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from frequent clichés ("scattered diamonds," "whispering secrets") and heavy reliance on abstract noun phrases. Several prompt-derived phrases feel awkwardly inserted ("bodily poetic grace"), disrupting the rhythm and drawing attention to the construction rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic with good density. However, the repeated use of antithetical parallelisms ("Not [X], but [Y]") across the final third becomes a noticeable rhetorical scaffold that stiffens the cadence of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and lyrical, with strong images like the tower catching air "like a question mark." Information density is high, and the rhythm supports the contemplative mood. Minor abstraction in the philosophical passages ("violence of permanent erasure") slightly slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm and imagery. However, the integration of the required phrase "technically gentle" in the final paragraph ("touched each bell technically gentle") is ungrammatical and creates a minor jar in an otherwise smooth finish.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("edges crumbling like old paper," "thin as communion bread"). Information density is high, though the final paragraph drifts into abstraction and summary rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is mechanically clean but marred by the forced repetition of the phrase "dusky harmony" (three times), which creates a noticeable lexical loop. Abstract phrasing like "empirically ironic truth" disrupts the rhythm and reads as a prompt insertion rather than organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is competent but relies on abstract "telling" ("plans elaborate webs," "manufactured narrative") and register-clashing scientific terms ("mitochondria") that disrupt the fantasy atmosphere. The imagery of the music box is a highlight, though surrounding description often leans into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with relevant imagery ("breath-like rhythm," "splintered glass"). Phrasing is precise, avoiding clunky artifacts, though "hands trembled" is a standard somatic marker that could be fresher.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and dense with sensory detail ("branches threading between ancient rafters"). The rhythm supports the emotional beats well. No significant artifacts or loops; the writing is efficient and evocative throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically competent, though it occasionally tips into "purple" description ("fear itself had learned to phosphoresce"). There is a slight reliance on filter verbs ("she'd noticed") which distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the strange environment.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("calcified meaning"). The line-level craft supports the atmospheric ambition well, avoiding major artifacts or clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery like the "emerald swatch card" and "rewriting the coastline." There is a tendency toward slightly dense, adjectival phrasing in spots ("unkindled solace"), but the rhythm generally supports the dreamlike quality.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from frequent filtering ("Maren knew," "She understood," "She felt") which distances the reader from the action. There is a reliance on abstract adjective-noun pairings ("practiced efficiency," "clear complexity") that tell the reader how to feel rather than showing the quality through specific detail.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is polished and readable, with clear imagery and no mechanical errors. However, the phrasing occasionally leans on standard descriptors ("desperate purpose," "shattered glass") rather than fresh observation. The insertion of required phrases like "gently luminous" and "hammered repose" is smooth enough but feels slightly calculated.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with some strong imagery ("arranged like accusations"). However, there is a reliance on filter verbs ("she saw," "she could see," "she understood") that distances the reader, and some compound metaphors ("thistle-hope") feel precious rather than precise.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with standout lines like "becoming architecture." However, occasional phrasing feels dense or slightly abstract ("feeling-tone," "crystal whispering forecourt after rain"), creating minor rhythmic stumbles in an otherwise smooth text.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythmic control, particularly in the chanting sections which establish a distinct beat ("Three beats rise..."). While the reliance on similes ("like smoke," "like a rope," "like spent powder") borders on repetitive, the imagery generally supports the tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with good attention to imagery ("catching starlight"). There is some reliance on telling ("Chen's warmly observant nature") where showing would be stronger, but the line-level craft generally sustains the mood well.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and evocative ("concrete wombs," "strange fruit"), with strong rhythm. There is a tendency to over-explain metaphors at peak moments (e.g., the paragraph defining the sound of the shattering jar), which stalls immediacy in favor of analysis.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but tends toward overwriting with adjective-heavy descriptions ("crystalline formations," "geometric marvel"). The prompt phrase "fluidly logical certainty" is inserted awkwardly, and moments of emotional summary ("silence had become her prison") replace potential showing.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    Imagery is dense and often striking ("trapped nebulas," "centuries of paint"), maintaining good momentum. There is some adjectival clutter ("wisely adventurous certainty") and occasional explanatory scaffolding that could be trimmed to heighten the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is polished but dense with "purple" artifacts and clichés ("scars latticed... like delicate embroidery," "beautiful devastation"). The reliance on explaining the significance of images ("That was intentional," "She knew what it meant") weakens the impact of the imagery itself.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong sensory details ("shadow in seventeen different directions") anchor the surrealism, though the prose occasionally relies on abstract summaries ("concepts became physical"). Line-level momentum is maintained, though some phrases ("image that hurt to perceive") lean on genre clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is generally polished, it suffers from noticeable repetition artifacts ("eloquently silent" used twice; "golden shadows" used twice) and some clichéd phrasing ("vanilla and dust," "flooding through him like cold water"). The phrase "first yawn of evening" leans into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally strong and atmospheric, though a typo ("a illustration") and some slightly expository phrasing ("factually mystical... verified sorcery") detract from the polish. The final sentence's repetition ("withdrawn knight, no longer withdrawn") feels slightly tautological rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished, but the opening zeugma ("smelled of paper decay and forgotten promises") is a cliché that weakens the sensory immediacy. The writing is competent but lacks the fresh, high-density imagery required for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with some strong imagery ("brass worn smooth by decades"). However, abstract phrasing ("repository of coded freedom") and repetition of the word "auric" (three times) detract from the otherwise solid line-level craft. The "cognitive dissonance" sentence reads like a scaffold or summary.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally high-quality with good rhythm. The opening phrasing "The morning fog saxophonist" reads slightly awkward as a title/descriptor, but line-level craft is otherwise polished.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prompt-stuffing creates logical and syntactic artifacts, such as the oxymoronic "moonstone cabochon dust speck" (a cut gem the size of dust?) and the awkward "hummed with mossy delight." These insertions disrupt the otherwise competent flow.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rhythmic and evocative ("roots had once stretched through stone and now only water flowed"). The line-level craft is strong, with good density and no significant scaffolding artifacts. The integration of required phrases is generally smooth, though the prompt-mandated oxymoron feels slightly stiff within the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from specific artifacts, notably the repetition of the phrase "luminous regret" and the mixed metaphor of a "stomach clench" with an abstract emotion. These insertions feel like forced prompt adherence that disrupts the otherwise immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is high-density with excellent rhythm ("grief rather than north") and visceral sensory details ("crooked, sharp where it should have been soft"). Figurative language is used with precision to advance the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose achieves high information density with strong imagery ("bioluminescent veins," "symphony of proportion") that serves the story's logic. Rhythm and syntax effectively mirror the protagonist's shift from jagged pain to harmonic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is rhythmic and dense with strong imagery ("rooftops blooming with gardens"), though occasional reliance on abstractions like "impossible colors" or "bottled starlight" softens the descriptive precision.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished with some evocative phrasing ("soft electric sigh"), though it occasionally drifts into overwritten abstraction ("weight distribute across his palms like a prayer"). The technical description of the dust patterns provides a nice, grounding counterweight to the spectral elements.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished but relies too heavily on filter verbs ("Marina watched," "Marina felt," "she saw"), creating unnecessary distance in a short piece. The phrase "reading rainbows" risks a jarring cultural association that briefly disrupts the high-fantasy tone.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and atmospheric, though occasionally dense with adjectival metaphors ("frozen music," "golden pollen"). The line "It made everyone philosophical" stands out as a weak moment of telling amidst otherwise strong showing.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong imagery ("candles guttered," "shimmering echoes"). It occasionally drifts into purple phrasing ("oxidized joy into sorrow"), but mechanically the sentences propel the action efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information load per sentence and no scaffold or loop artifacts. Imagery is precise ("shades of pearl and shadow," "tasted of primordial storms") and serves the drive lens. Rhythmic control is strong, slowing appropriately for the "resonant hush" of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.0)
    While imagery is often strong ("layered hull over wave"), the prose suffers from a didactic closing sequence and a cliché description of the GPS ("cheerfully recalculating"). The "turbine" motif repeats to the point of becoming a text artifact without deepening the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.7)
    The insertion of the long prompt phrase about "hidden layers" into dialogue is syntactically clunky and redundant ("St. Margaret's... cathedral window"), disrupting the rhythm. "Umbral tenderness" reads as an overwrought modifier.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished, but "retrocognitively" is a jarring register slip in a mythic/lyrical passage. "Bitter as salt" is a cliché that weakens the specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and lyrical with strong imagery ("breathing of something long dead"). Rhythm is controlled, though the mid-section relies slightly on repetitive sentence structures ("Miranda remembered... Miranda closed...").

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with strong sensory imagery ("taste of honey and ash"). A few phrases lean toward the melodramatic ("velvet disquiet," "impossibly older"), but the line-level craft generally supports the tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("tears of glass"). The specific phrase "furiously tranquil" is repeated, drawing slight attention to itself as a text artifact, but the overall rhythm and sentence variety are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean and rhythmic, though the phrase "credibly curious investigation" reads as a clumsy artifact forced into the sentence. The description of the storm and the rope's vibration is vivid and mechanically clear.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but heavy with abstract nouns and adjectives ("bureaucratic inertia," "flourishing stillness"). The log entry dialogue ("Brief enough to matter") feels slightly staged and melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished but suffers from abstract telling ("craftsmanship spoke of devotion," "trembling emotion") that creates a filter between reader and action. Several phrasing choices feel slightly formulaic or adjectival ("tranquilly perceptive," "mute eloquence"), reducing the density and sharpness of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished and readable with good information density. However, moments of telling ("tears forming," "nervous") and the awkward insertion of prompt phrases into dialogue ("lived suddenly timeless") disrupt the otherwise smooth rhythmic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is mechanically sound but dense with "literary" clichés ("symphony of ripples," "curtain dissipate," "divine breath"). The reliance on Adjective-Noun pairings ("cobalt lagoon," "burnished hush," "warmly attentive") creates a repetitive rhythm that dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and descriptive but leans heavily on filter verbs and summary reporting ("Birds... suddenly appeared," "The pillars seemed to pulse"). The phrase "brazen calm" is repeated as a label rather than demonstrated through distinct micro-choices. The density is good, but the lack of scenic immediacy flattens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is polished and high-density, with strong rhythm and evocative imagery ("quiet that followed the ringing"). The phrase "luminous skeptic turned reluctant pilgrim" in the finale is a slight tell, but the surrounding imagery supports it. Zero artifacting or loop issues; the sentences propel the introspection forward.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and descriptive, with good rhythm and clarity. There are moments of slight overwriting ("painted the horizon," "vastness of life"), but the line-level craft generally supports the atmospheric intent without obstructing the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is competent but occasionally overwrought ("landscapes of loss," "tinted revelations poured"). Several required phrases are inserted awkwardly as modifiers rather than integrated naturally, and the dialogue often reads like written speeches rather than spoken language.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and readable with good rhythm, though it occasionally leans on filter verbs ("Maya understood," "She saw") and adjectival phrasing. The imagery is dense, but the reliance on explanation over action prevents the line-level craft from reaching the next tier.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is polished but marred by overwriting and abstract descriptors ("sacredly playful eyes," "cautious abandon"). The imagery occasionally breaks physical logic for effect (breath instantly tinkling as crystals), which distracts from the scene's grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is elegant and rhythmically controlled, with strong imagery ("curved... like a stone ear"). There are moments of "telling" where showing would be more impactful (e.g., the summary of her "benevolently ruthless" documentation in the soup kitchen), but the line-level craft is generally high. No distracting artifacts or loops; the writing is dense and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished but marred by several specific clichés ("narrow house with narrow minds," "more true than truth itself," "colors that had no names") that dampen the impact of otherwise strong imagery. These phrasing choices lower the distinctiveness of the line-level craft despite the strong rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("Time exhaled and resumed its ancient rhythm") with strong rhythmic control. Imagery is functional and vivid without becoming purple; line-level craft is polished and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, dense, and rhythmically varied. A slight deduction for the phrase "noise pretending to be signal," which introduces an anachronistic information-theory register that clashes slightly with the ancient/bone aesthetic. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative ("star chart of decay"), but occasionally slips into clichés ("gears sang a different rhythm"). The use of filter verbs in the climax ("Maya felt," "She understood") dilutes the impact of the sensory details. The pacing and rhythm, however, effectively mirror the breathless subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Imagery is generally vivid, but the text relies on repetitive descriptors ("impossible turquoise," "impossible geometry") and recycles the "temporary eternity" phrase, creating noticeable lexical echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the rhythm is generally competent, the prose suffers from "purple" abstraction ("impossible scent," "vibrations of intent") that obscures mechanics. The critical proofreading failure in the climax (the "Background" name substitution) renders the piece unpublishable in a demanding market.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. Phrases like "chemical time encoded in decay" and "geography of loss was measured in empty chairs" demonstrate excellent command of imagery without becoming overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric ("iris of impossible green"). Minor reliance on cognitive verbs ("realized," "understood") to advance the plot dampens the immediacy of the character's internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished with high density ("brittle as prayer" is excellent), but the opening simile ("mist like a question mark") is a weak, slightly cliché stylistic choice. The rhythm is good, and line-level flow supports the contemplative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and readable, with good flow. However, the phrase "empirically intuitive" is clunky and repeated as a shortcut for characterization. Some descriptors ("narcotic," "ethereal") lean toward cliché, preventing the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic. A few stock metaphors ("heart had calcified," "mouth mid-scream") and standard descriptions ("rivulets of silver-white") prevent a higher score, but clarity and momentum remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "purple" tendencies and awkward forced phrasing to fit prompt elements ("palette of resolve," "directed spontaneity"). Abstract nouns often replace concrete descriptions ("quality of doubt and hope braided together").

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is generally polished, but marred by weak metaphors like "Time was soup now" which disrupt the otherwise specific texture. While the descriptions of the scroll are lovely, the reliance on filter verbs ("she'd recognized," "she'd started") and summary sentences slows the momentum and distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is rhythmic and competent, but marred by occasional overwriting and a tendency toward repetitive sentence openers ("Elena pressed," "Elena lifted," "Elena thought"). Information density is generally good, though filter verbs dilute the immediacy of the observational beats.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and functional, but relies on stock metaphors ("liquid moonlight") and some purple abstraction ("story that had learned to read itself"). The line-level craft sustains momentum but misses the high-density specificity required for the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong rhythm. There are minor instances of slightly purple phrasing ("grief made tangible," "jasmine and regret"), but the line-level craft generally supports the ethereal grit tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft is weakened by a reliance on filter verbs ("saw," "witnessed," "understood"), particularly in the climax, which summarizes the revelation instead of dramatizing it. Phrases like "resounding hush" lean on cliché, and the prose often tells the reader what is happening rather than showing the sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like "line so precise it could cut" and "mechanical sentiment." The sentence-level propulsion is strong, effectively pacing the tension of the countdown. A near-perfect execution, held back only slightly by the thematic explication near the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several distinctive phrases are repeated verbatim ("quiet wildfire," "echo of morning birdsong"), creating noticeable text loops that stall momentum. These artifacts detract from an otherwise clean prose style.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from cliché ("water on stone") and overwrought figurative language ("question mark dissolving into possibility") at the climax. These artifacts dilute the density and emotional impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally high-quality, but marred by the repetition of the phrase "melodically haunted" (used twice in a short span) and the slightly greeting-card-esque metaphor "DNA of a new hello." These artifacts detract from the otherwise dense and rhythmic delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from abstract labeling ("haunted euphoria") and occasional pathetic fallacy ("flowers... listening"). While the rhythm is generally good, the reliance on telling emotions rather than showing them weakens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, but marred by the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "desperately jocular," which draws attention to the artifice. The density of abstract, explanatory sentences in the final third slows the momentum and tells rather than shows the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose suffers from repetitive S-V-O sentence structures ("Sera felt," "She pulled," "She held," "She followed"), creating a metronomic rhythm. High density of filter verbs ("she heard," "she understood") distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience, particularly in the climax where the realization is told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and propulsive, with high information density and evocative imagery ("history flexed like a poem"). The "question mark nib" symbolism is slightly heavy-handed, but the execution of the "unbending" action redeems it. Line-level craft is sharp, maintaining momentum through the exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("bloom like flowers," "scattered diamonds") and abstract telling ("joyful sorrow," "transcendent"). High adjective density and "purple" descriptors ("luminous" appears frequently) obscure concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally polished and propulsive, though the phrase "volcanic tenderness erupting" borders on purple and feels mechanically inserted. The description of the library "arsonist" reality is a standout linguistic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm and sensory density are strong, creating a fluid reading experience ("silence pooled in shallow depressions"). However, a reliance on stacked, high-register modifiers ("auric," "crystalline," "auroral") occasionally tips into purple prose, slightly distancing the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is functional and clear but leans on standard descriptors ("shuffling," "staccato," "steel canyons"). The inciting incident is delivered via flashback exposition, slowing the opening momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished, but the repetition of "spiralingly calm" creates a distracting artifact. The mention of photography breaks the lexical and world-building consistency of the pre-industrial setting.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is high-quality, free of mechanical errors, and rhythmically controlled. There is a slight tendency toward "writerly" phrasing in dialogue ("planting forests of second thoughts"), but the line-level craft is otherwise precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished and readable but suffers from metaphor density and cliché ("smile broke like sunrise," "blooming like bioluminescence"). While free of mechanical errors, the reliance on poetic stock phrases reduces the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished with strong rhythm, particularly in the &quot;narrated&quot; sections. The phrase &quot;renewable indifference&quot; is standout work. However, the simile &quot;wood curls fell onto his lap like tiny prayers&quot; borders on sentimental cliché, slightly reducing the otherwise sharp textural quality.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is competent but suffers from "telling" emotional states ("tremor of certainty," "visceral knowledge"). Several prompt phrases are inserted verbatim or repetitively, disrupting the flow ("tremor of certainty" appears twice; "lantern-moth" appears as both simile and tone tag).

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished, though the verbatim repetition of the specific phrase "innocently cunning" (once for the trail, once for fronds) reads as a forced prompt insertion that breaks immersion. The ending relies on summary explanation rather than dramatized implication.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally polished but leans into purple descriptors ("fractured light dancing," "achingly real") that soften the impact of the sci-fi elements. The prompt word "propel" is used twice in close proximity near the end, creating a minor repetitive artifact that draws attention to the scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is competent but leans into purple phrasing and abstract emotional labeling ("curtains of intention," "divine hope"). The phrase "genuinely artificial" feels inserted rather than organic. There is a tendency to tell emotions ("felt that subdued ardor") rather than evoking them through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished but relies on several clichés ("scattered diamonds," "haunted look," "plain sight") that diminish freshness. While mechanically sound, the writing occasionally drifts into expository heaviness during the explanation of the diagrams.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by abstract descriptors ("defied architecture") and forced metaphors ("recognized as atoms of nostalgia"). Several lines rely on "telling" complex emotions ("anguished joy") rather than evoking them through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose suffers from noticeable artifacts, specifically the exact repetition of "softly deliberate" (used for steps, then certainty) and the echo of "particular [noun]" (gravity, ache). "Metamorphosed" feels slightly strained as a verb for comparing video frames, leaning into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is competent but suffers from adjectival clutter ("fragile convictions," "shimmering stillness," "quietly vivid") and abstract metaphors linked to concrete objects ("like discarded certainty"). These artifacts create a "writerly" texture that draws attention to the author rather than the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("sedimentary layers," "displaced miracle") that serves the story's atmosphere. Information density is high, and the rhythm supports the pacing well. A few phrases border on slightly convenient thematic summary ("Some scars wrote themselves in layers"), but overall execution is high-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished but marred by some "telling" descriptors (e.g., "spatially imaginative") and stock similes ("like water into soil," "like water breaking through a dam"). Rhythm is generally smooth, though the "pathetic fallacy" of the thunder feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is mechanically competent but suffers from a density of abstract metaphors and creative writing tropes ("presence woven from old starlight") that prioritize sound over clarity. Several sentences lean into melodrama ("voice like wind through empty cathedrals") which slows momentum without adding specific information. There is a reliance on telling via abstraction rather than showing through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with imagery ("smoke clouds learned to hold their shape"). Syntax is controlled, though slightly repetitive in subject-verb openers in the first third. No significant artifacts or loops; the line-level craft supports the dreamlike atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose features strong imagery in the descriptive passages ("leaves chimed instead of rustled"), but the climax relies on abstract telling ("sound like revelation," "not destructively but transformatively"). Filter verbs ("He heard it," "He saw") occasionally distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes ("years like driftwood," "breaking like foam," "persistent as waves," "like a confession," "like moonlight," "like sea foam"). This repetitive "X like Y" structure becomes an artifact that stalls momentum and feels like unrefined lyrical ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, though "steam rising like small prayers" borders on sentimental overwriting. "Pins and needles blossoming" is a slight mixed metaphor that clashes with the harshness of the setting. Rhythm and flow support the somber tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but reliant on stock fantasy phrasing ("fabric of deception," "web of lies," "ancient dance"). While rhythmically smooth, the reliance on clichés for key images dilutes the impact. The description of the rune ("like watching a cathedral spire topple") is a rare moment of specific imagery amidst generalities.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is polished with evocative imagery regarding the ocean and reef. However, the repetitive "tap-tap" motif and some expository sentences slightly drag the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is competent but leans on "writerly" abstractions ("philosophical statement rather than a safety hazard") and standard atmospheric descriptors ("bleeding away," "deepening dusk"). The repetition of the phrase "thunderous serenity" frames the epiphany but feels slightly forced as a rhetorical device.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished with high density and some strong similes ("nagged... like a root"). However, relies heavily on summary to bridge scenes, and occasional clichés ("tasted of iron and time," "crescendoed") soften the impact of the stronger lines.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose has momentum but is marred by "literary" clichés ("wearing hope like jewelry," "ocean sang its endless song," "salt-kissed"). These artifacts flatten the texture and reduce the impact of the otherwise competent imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generally strong prose, but marred by lexical repetition ("heart luminescent" followed shortly by "luminescent ache") and some dense metaphorical abstraction in high-pressure beats. These artifacts drag on the momentum during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong sensory verbs ("punished," "conspired") driving the momentum. The description of the ink patterns effectively anchors the abstract concept of time dilation in concrete imagery without relying on scaffold or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the sensory prose is often sharp, the line-level craft suffers from telling shortcuts ("bravely conflicted") and purple abstractions ("contraband paper become liberated ash"). The verbatim insertion of prompt phrases occasionally disrupts the rhythmic flow and naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is high-density and evocative without falling into purple patches; phrases like "silhouette of edges" and "sifting from his coat" carry heavy character weight. There are no visible loops or filter artifacts. The rhythm supports the tension, slowing appropriately at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is sensory-rich and rhythmical ("dragged trails of starlight"), suiting the subject matter. A few phrasings verge on purple ("all teeth and tenderness"), but the line-level craft is generally sharp and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rhythmic and generally dense, though it occasionally dips into purple phrasing ("ink the color of midnight between stars," "creature waking from ancient sleep"). These artifacts slightly dull the otherwise sharp precision of the "devotedly observant" voice.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished with high information density and strong imagery ("Cretaceous bloom"). However, some phrasing borders on purple ("firmware opened to her like a wound," "meteor hush"), and sentence structures occasionally become repetitive with "Vera [verb]" openings.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmic ("memories flaking away like old paint"), with high information density. However, the continuity error regarding the medium (chalk on stone vs. "sand mandala") in the final third disrupts the visual logic and prevents a higher score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is functional but marred by redundancy and purple phrasing, such as "sky fractured like broken glass" (tautology) and "tessera-studded testament" (heavy alliteration). The phrase "warm coldness" is an ineffective oxymoron that disrupts the descriptive flow.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose relies heavily on cliché similes ("warm as summer honey," "bright as childhood Christmas mornings," "chimed like church bells") and abstract nouns ("possibility," "despair"). Synesthesia is rendered through lists of adjectives rather than fresh, arresting imagery. The density of figurative language in the climax obscures the physical action rather than heightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished, but the repetition of "fractally precise" (once in narration, once echoed in dialogue/concept) and the generic "something permanent, something strange" reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought ("crimson anger bleeding"), and the integration of prompt phrases like "factually mystical" feels mechanical. The reliance on internal summary to convey the climax ("suddenly understood") robs the moment of dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is mechanically clean and flows smoothly, but relies on some stock imagery ("unfurled like a ribbon," "barely louder than breath") that dulls the impact. Narrative summary is often used in place of active scene work ("Mara understood," "Mara's motivation crystallized").

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished but leans heavily on abstract emotional summary ("hollow spaces," "unused courage") instead of concrete interiority. There is a tendency toward overwriting in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished with high information density. "Stars scattered like punctuation marks" is an excellent closing image that ties back to the central metaphor. A few phrases lean slightly toward overwrought ("mist thick as wool," "whispered urgency"), but the overall control of rhythm and imagery is strong and serves the story's atmospheric needs.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.6)
    Mechanically competent, but marred by the noticeable repetition of "thrum/thrummed/thrumming" and "thrumming" as a crutch for atmosphere. Some phrasing leans purple ("light bent around invisible seams") without grounding in concrete imagery. The density of abstract nouns weakens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from adjectival clustering and label-speak (e.g., "wistfully pragmatic efficiency"). The repetition of "quivering hush" feels like a forced prompt insertion rather than organic description, and some imagery leans toward the sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong sensory details ("verdigris-streaked," "white ocean") and good rhythm. Minor artifacting occurs in the final paragraph with repetitive abstract phrasing ("translating the untranslatable"), but line-level craft is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, evocative, and polished ("cupped palm holding silence"), with excellent rhythm and sensory precision; no scaffold artifacts or line-level drag.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose manages density well ("ethereal grit"), but the climax is softened by filter verbs ("Mara felt," "she knew") that place distance between the reader and the physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and dense, with evocative imagery like darkness "pooling" and the compass point as a "talisman." Line-level momentum is good, though the insertion of prompt phrases ("prudently adventurous") creates a slight rhythmic stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished but leans into purple phrasing ("lanced through sadness like light through glass"). The distinct phrase "furrowed hush" is repeated verbatim within a short span, reading more as a lexical loop than a resonant echo.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally clean and capable, with some strong images ("yellowed pages crackling like thin ice"). However, it relies on inserted modifiers to meet prompt requirements ("spongey dread," "nervously confident") and falls back on some genre clichés ("impossible geometries") that dilute the freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.0)
    Phrasing relies on abstractions ("luminous disbelief coursed through her veins," "quantum vibration") that weaken impact. Tells like "dynamically observant by necessity" replace active demonstration of the trait.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally evocative ("mist rose from the tracks"), but the specific prompt phrases ("polished calm," "dusky harmony") are inserted as labels that border on repetitive. The repetition of "calm" in the fifth paragraph ("maintained a polished calm," "perceptively calm") creates a minor rhythmic stall.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("pulsed their ancient rhythms"), with good information density. However, some imagery leans toward cliché ("Understanding dawned between them like sunrise"), and the final section drifts into abstract summarization.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished but relies on several standard clichés ("moths to flame," "scream that made no sound," "iron forged"). While the rhythm is good, these artifacts reduce the freshness of the line-level work in a literary context.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with a strong opening sentence. However, the text relies on some clichés ("swallowed by shadow," "terror and joy braided together") and abstract nouns that reduce impact. Information density is good, but the "anxious elation" repetition is a minor artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with standout images like "swallowed wasps" and roots coiling "lovingly." The rhythm supports the somber, magical tone without dragging.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong imagery ("holy silence," "prayer flag") and no significant scaffolding artifacts. The metaphor of reputation crumbling like "sedimentary rock" is slightly overwritten, but the line-level craft is generally precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose density is lowered by several clichés ("knuckles white," "ripples in the charged air") and instances of "telling" rather than showing ("knowledge flooded her mind," "pure understanding"). The phrase "scientific mind rejected such anthropomorphism" is a standard trope that summarizes internal state rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose rhythm is strong and the imagery is evocative, particularly the description of the "migrating identities." The writing is dense and economical, with only minor reliance on slightly worn phrasings like "economical yet graceful."

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear but relies on clichés (e.g., "crown of thorns") and awkward insertions of prompt phrases ("heartbeat of a hesitation"). The dialogue/monologue within the shell feels overly writerly and staged.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with abstract phrasing ("truth in water's constant motion," "patient resurrection"). While rhythmically sound, the density of metaphorical reflection sometimes stalls narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from mixed metaphors ("bloomed like cold fire") and abstract sensory pairings that obscure clarity. The literal insertion of the prompt phrase "cautious exuberance" constitutes a significant "tell" that disrupts immersion by labeling emotion rather than evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally evocative, but "perforated destiny, punched through with holes" is a tautology that drags on efficiency. Some phrasing leans toward the melodramatic ("frequencies that made glaciers weep"), which blunts the emotional precision.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and sensory-rich, with strong rhythm and specific vocabulary ("whale oil," "crushed garnets"). Minor artifacts like the zeugma in the opening ("anchored to... determination") and the cliché of the aurora "singing" detract slightly from the otherwise high density and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery. A noticeable repetition of "impossible" (impossible place/impossible length) in early paragraphs and a template-cadence triple simile at the closure ("like a heartbeat, like a promise, like the next breath") detract slightly from the finish.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished with a strong rhythmic flow and high information density. Images like the "hollow mirror shard" are handled well without over-explaining. There are no significant loops or artifacts, though a few phrases ("sincerely insincere," "gray veil") feel slightly constructed to fit specific prompts or poetic registers rather than arising organically.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm, particularly the "sycamore hush" description. Some phrasing drifts into abstraction ("celestial resonance," "ancient magnetic forces") which dilutes the sensory immediacy, but the water imagery is handled with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("layered like sediment"), but momentum drags due to expository filtering ("He felt," "He understood"). Transitions are sometimes mechanical ("And then, deeper still"), and the reliance on abstract nouns flattens the physical immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally competent but marred by occasional clichés (e.g., "flickered like a candle in a hurricane") and abstract phrasings ("sacred simplicity") that dilute the imagery. The description of the "brilliant dimness" works well, but the reliance on explanatory summary in the final third drags the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative ("violet threading silver"). However, the phrase "meteor hush ascent" reads as a clunky noun stack that disrupts the rhythm of the closure, and "luminous" repeats slightly too often.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Imagery is precise and evocative ("violent and clarifying," "death rattle"), with good rhythmic control. The prose is dense and avoids scaffold, though the awkward phrasing required by the prompt slightly disrupts the flow in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    Technically clean but hampered by cliché ("trembling fingers," "dying by degrees," "impossible hope") and purple phrasing ("jewel of perfect grief"). These stock descriptors smooth over the emotional roughness that the scene needs, rendering the pain generic rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, effectively utilizing the "seven and eleven" motif to build cadence without creating repetitive artifacts. Imagery is dense and functional, though a few moments of "telling" in the character introductions slightly lower the density of the early paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with high information density and strong imagery ("sapphire-hued liqueur label"). Minor overwriting appears in lines like "darkness and light existed simultaneously," which feels slightly tautological, but the overall craft supports the tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is fluid and grammatically clean with good momentum. There is a tendency toward slightly overwrought phrasing (&quot;kissed the strands,&quot; &quot;suspended eternally&quot;) and adjective-heavy description that softens the impact. The line-level craft is solid but lacks the density and freshness of high-band work.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong rhythm in the descriptive passages. A few phrases feel slightly forced to accommodate required elements (e.g., "attentively inventive"), but the overall line-level craft supports the tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with excellent metaphorical cohesion (e.g., the neural/timeline parallel). A single minor cliché ("words ash in her mouth") is the only slip in an otherwise precise and evocative text.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, though the verbatim repetition of "storm-born silence" (intro and conclusion) feels heavy-handed. The required phrase "across the hush..." is integrated grammatically but leans toward purple prose that contrasts with the analytical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is competent but marred by the sermonizing conclusion and some forced phrasing ("mournfully eager") to accommodate prompt elements. The use of "macerate" is semantically strained for the context of a leaf blower, creating a minor diction stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong rhythm. A few phrases required by the prompt (e.g., "interiorizing exteriors") feel slightly abstract and jargon-heavy compared to the vivid physical descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.6)
    Several line-level issues mar the polish: a distracting repetition loop ("forbidden vivification rites her father had forbidden"), a grammar slip ("stains of thousand miscalculations"), and clunky modifier clusters ("stoically sensitive"). The use of the cliché "the moment when the penny drops" disrupts the fantasy tone.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally polished with good rhythm, but suffers from abstract metaphors that blur rather than sharpen imagery ("veins of frozen light," "blueprint of silence"). The phrase "guts of a gutted transmitter" is a distracting repetition. The writing is competent but lacks the dense, concrete precision of the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.8)
    Phrasing relies on telling over showing, epitomized by the clunky "resiliently positive energy." Clichés like "smiling cryptically" and vague descriptions like "impossible skies" reduce descriptive density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, though the phrase "unsettling calm" is repeated as a lexical artifact. The climax relies on a list of summarized memories rather than a specific, fully dramatized scene, which dilutes the impact of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and high-density, with evocative imagery like "geological processes compressed into seconds." Minor phrasing issues, such as the awkward adverbial construction "balancedly curious" and the explicit telling of "double meaning," prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "adjective-noun" overload in the opening ("bruised hour," "skeletal ferns," "spiderweb shadows") and sentimental abstraction. The sentence "incidental heroism was the only kind that mattered" acts as a scaffold to force the prompt element rather than letting the action speak.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally rhythmic, but precision suffers in key descriptions. The conflation of medieval history with telegraphs and tides with phase transitions indicates a lack of conceptual rigor at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("pearl half-buried," "fractaling outward"). Minor tendency toward melodrama in moments ("tears freezing on her cheeks") and some standard phrasing ("deafening noise of failure") prevents higher banding.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and lyrical, with strong density and rhythm ("frozen scream," "smooth worry of river stones"). The description of the sensory translation is articulate and avoids becoming overly abstract, anchoring the magic in physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished but hampered by tier-two clichés ("twisted like smoke," "crack like ice") that appear at critical junctures, reducing the impact of the imagery. The reliance on adjectival density and standard similes prevents the line-level craft from matching the quality of the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is weighed down by adjectival clutter ("resonantly soft," "practiced grace," "unexpectedly wet") and filter verbs that distance the reader. Figurative language often feels decorative rather than structural ("tasted of starlight"), and the reliance on abstract descriptors ("impossible colors") misses opportunities for concrete, grounding detail. Rhythm is functional but lacks propulsion during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is high-quality with strong, precise imagery ("lightning suspended in glass"), though occasional metaphorical density ("warring silences") borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.5)
    Rhythm is controlled, but the prose relies on abstract labels ("like blessing," "grace") to carry emotional weight instead of concrete imagery. Some metaphorical phrasing ("caught light like water") borders on standard literary description.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but relies on filter verbs ("She felt the building breathe") and abstract lists to convey the magic system. These artifacts distance the reader during the climax, telling the experience rather than showing the sensory shift.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is competent but marred by clichés ("translucent as morning fog") and "purple" abstractions that weaken density. The reliance on standard fantasy descriptors prevents the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is competent but marred by the repetition of the distinct phrase "hush of cosmic possibility" in both dialogue and narration, which feels like a loop rather than a motif. Phrasing occasionally drifts into abstraction ("where secrets envelope themselves in layers of fear") instead of grounding the reader in concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is rhythmic and lush, with high information density. A minor filter in the epiphany ("Vera understood now") slightly dulls the immediacy of the realization, but the surrounding sensory imagery is precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished but suffers from overwriting, particularly in similes (the "playground swing" construction is syntactically dense and explains itself). Abstract phrasing ("geometry of difficult truths") occasionally obscures the concrete emotional reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from adjectival density and stock fantasy phrasing ("sharp as thought," "thin as spider silk"). While functional, the reliance on abstract noun phrases and standard metaphors prevents the imagery from achieving sharp, fresh specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and possesses a strong rhythmic flow, with successful imagery like the net accumulating silence like prayers. However, the tendency to explain the emotional weight of moments rather than dramatizing them limits the visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished and propulsive, moving the action forward efficiently. However, the use of the "shielded openness" label and the "question mark" imagery detracts from the otherwise grounded and atmospheric style.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with good density and momentum. A few phrases lean toward cliché ("cathedral of loss") or melodrama ("true and insufficient"), but the line-level craft is generally high-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally functional with some strong images, but marred by awkward prompt-mashing ("driftingly alert awareness") and some cliché ("rolling across the sky like a drum"). Information density is moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and readable with good rhythm. There is a slight reliance on abstract descriptors ("routine sorrow," "fragments of light," "warmly inquisitive") that tell rather than show, but no major artifacts or loops impede the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and high-density, with strong imagery like "catching starlight like scattered grief." Sentence rhythm supports the contemplative mood without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the flow is generally good, the root word "fractal" is overused (four times: "fractally precise detail," "measurements," "documentation," "stars fractaling"), becoming a distracted text artifact. This repetition dulls the impact of the description significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished with high density and strong tactile imagery ("soft as cloth," "murmuration breaking apart"). The explicit statement of the theme ("teaching her their wisdom") is a slight over-tell that softens the impact of the image itself. Otherwise, the line-level craft is precise and free of loops.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is smooth and rhythmically sound, with some strong images like rust as "orange moss." There is a tendency toward adjective-heavy descriptions ("pale glow," "ancient architecture") that occasionally slows momentum, but clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished with some evocative phrasing ("brambled hope"), but the reliance on summary telling ("The recovery came slowly") reduces information density and immediacy. The narrative distance prevents the prose from doing heavy lifting during key emotional turns.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the sentence structure is generally functional, the prose suffers from extreme repetitive artifacting. The phrase "nested patterns" appears six times in a short space, and "beautifully flawed," "bruised awe," and "pane of hush" are also looped verbatim. This aggressive repetition of keywords acts as a scaffold that clutters the text and dulls the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally dense and propulsive, particularly during the labyrinth run. However, a few strained metaphors ("bark rough as grief," "recognition dawning like cold water") and the slightly awkward insertion of prompt phrases ("offhandedly exact") create minor friction at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and has good momentum, but it relies on filter verbs ("noticed," "realized," "understood") that distance the reader during key beats. The scaffold phrase "The pieces were falling into place now" and the explicit explanation of the foam metaphor act as drag on the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush and evocative ("refracting clouds," "reverse ink"), with high image density. The rhythm is controlled and supports the ethereal tone. A few phrases appear to be shoehorned prompts ("mindfully scattered," "integrated fragmentation"), creating minor ripples in an otherwise smooth surface.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control. Imagery is sharp ("staircase of salt and memory"). There is a slight tendency toward repetition of prompt words ("subsume," "sturdy") that feels mechanical rather than organic, but the overall line-level craft is high-quality and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but relies on "telling" summaries and adjective-heavy descriptions. The clumsy insertion of the prompt phrase "empathetic decisiveness" disrupts the rhythm and reads as an artificial artifact rather than organic characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is generally clear but marred by clichés ("tendrils of connection") and oxymoronic modifiers ("chaotic precision") that feel forced. The ending dissolves into abstract summary, losing the concreteness established in the opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is generally clear but marred by the repetitive, conspicuous insertion of prompt phrases ("clandestinely luminous," "latent blaze") which creates a scaffolded, artificial rhythm. The repetition of "prism-minded" also reduces the freshness of the description.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but prone to "purple" overwriting and adjective stuffing ("frozen symphonies," "liminal moment"). While the imagery is often pretty, the reliance on high-register descriptors occasionally stalls the narrative momentum and feels decorative rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong rhythm and imagery ("terror lodged between 'I agree' and 'to serve'"). Minor deduction for the "hopeful melancholy" tell, but otherwise the line-level craft supports the atmosphere well.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally high-quality with strong imagery ("locks... frozen conversations"). However, the forced insertion of prompt-mandated phrases like "intuitively descriptive" creates minor rhythmic stumbles and syntactic awkwardness.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by stock phrases ("blessing and curse") and clunky usage ("journalize"). While there are strong images (petals, vines), the reliance on summary prevents rhythmic variation during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished with high density and strong imagery ("shadows that moved like thoughts," "silver threads"). Rhythm and syntax support the movement of the pod. A few expository lumps and the "she finally understood" scaffolding in the conclusion drag the score down by telling instead of showing the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong imagery and rhythmic control; phrases like "amplify every footfall into an accusation" land well. The technical language enhances credibility without disrupting momentum, though the phrase "rapidly adapting" is repeated verbatim, creating a minor echo.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but relies on clichés ("pregnant pause," "words tasting of ash") and heavy modification; the density of abstract figurative language slows momentum without adding muscularity to the action.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished with strong density ("bleached white by centuries of flash floods"). However, the phrase "presence rather than an absence" is a cliché that weakens the description, and "doors opening between forever" drifts into vague purple prose at the critical closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from simile density ("like a frozen lake," "sharp as broken glass," "viscous as honey," "like a dying flower"). While individual images are strong, the accumulation creates a slightly overwrought texture that occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is competent and clear, with some strong imagery ("puddled on the teaching room floor"). However, reliance on filter verbs ("Kael noticed," "found himself") distances the reader from the immediate experience. The pacing is steady but lacks variation in density to match emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong imagery. The repetition of the unique phrase "shifted hush" draws attention to itself as a structural marker, which feels slightly mechanical, but the line-level crafting is otherwise precise.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level craft is competent but marred by significant artifacts; "stoically sparkling" is an adverb-adjective stack that degrades the prose quality. The phrase "raveling silence" is repeated three times in a short space, creating a loop rather than a resonant refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clear and dense, though descriptor repetition ("azure" appears four times; "floating" and "crystallized" recur frequently) reduces freshness. The summary of the climax ("They worked through the night") is a structural weakness that line-level craft cannot hide.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and dense with sensory imagery, though it relies on repetitive stage business involving eyes ("closing her eyes," "opened her eyes") across the short length. The rhythm is steady, but the "spontaneous as heartbeats" simile is slightly clunky, and the ending leans into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and readable but suffers from "literary" adjectival clustering ("weathered perfection," "luminescent ache") that feels slightly ornamental. The triad "flickered. Stuttered. Died." is a cliché rhythm that reduces the impact of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose has a strong rhythmic cadence, but frequently substitutes abstract metaphors ("splitting the beam into component meanings") for concrete description. Narrative summary often overtakes scene-level action, particularly in the explanation of the light's function.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is generally competent, the repetition of specific distinct phrases ("iridescent caution" and "quietly explosive" both appear twice in short succession) creates noticeable echoes that break immersion. The description occasionally leans into purple prose ("colors that had no names") rather than precise observation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level mechanics are generally competent, with a strong opening image, but the prose relies on filtering ("She nodded," "She felt") and abstract metaphors that lack grounding. Phrases like "cut through probability" sound impressive but lack narrative utility, acting as ornamental clutter rather than functional description.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but relies heavily on simile ("like splitting ice," "like aurora," "like flags") and abstract descriptors ("essence," "shimmered") that slightly dilute the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished but occasionally leans into purple phrasing ("enlarged tranquility," "nestled paradoxes"). Filter verbs ("she understood," "she thought") distance the reader from the immediate experience of the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Imagery is often striking ("vines claiming marble columns"), but the prose suffers from the aforementioned register slip and occasional simile clutter ("understanding blooming like the guerrilla gardens"). The rhythm is solid, but the artifact distracts.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is fluid but suffers from adjectival stacking ("gently meticulous") and sentimental abstractions ("impossibly golden," "absolute zero of significance"). While mechanically sound, the reliance on emotive telling over concrete showing dulls the impact of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is distinct and atmospheric with strong rhythm ("water lapped against the pilings"). Information density is high, and the imagery avoids clutter. A few phrasings hover near genre cliché, but the overall execution is sharp and immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is competent and often evocative, particularly in the synesthetic descriptions. However, the ending relies on a tired rhetorical structure ("simultaneously ancient and impossibly new"), and the reliance on adjectival stacking ("cardamom-sweet signature") occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is functional but suffers from telling and awkwardly inserted prompt phrases like "mnemonically gifted mind," which disrupts the rhythm. The climax relies on list-like summary ("The businessman became... The nurse grew...") that flattens the scene's emotional impact into a catalog of images.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished and readable but relies on filter verbs ("Mira felt," "begun noticing") that distance the reader. Some imagery pushes into purple territory ("crystallized slowly, like frost"), and the reliance on summary dilutes the line-level density.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with strong imagery ("rolled beneath her boots like a pale ocean"). However, occasional reliance on slightly worn phrasings ("bone-deep," "wordless smile") and abstract modifiers ("infinitesimal," "desperate") dampens the freshness of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero scaffolding artifacts. Lines like "releasing breath they'd never needed to take" and "cursed with nostalgia that corroded their circuits like rust" demonstrate excellent control of rhythm and imagery that serves character interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean but leans heavily on stock metaphors and similes ("coffee like a shield," "like a photograph in developing fluid," "scatter them like dust"). These familiar images reduce the distinctness of the imagery. The phrasing is often functional rather than propelling or texturally specific.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmically controlled ("laboratory exhaled behind her"), with strong imagery. There are minor tendencies toward overwriting in descriptive passages, but the line-level craft is generally high quality and free of distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density. Minor usage of slightly abstract phrases ("dimensions she couldn't name," "recursive and purposeful") prevents a perfect score, but the sensory imagery ("smell of lamp oil and lavender") is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally polished and lyrical ("silence, like any garden, required constant tending"). However, a few phrases lean into cliché or standard rhetoric ("riddles wrapped in metaphors wrapped in lies"), which detracts slightly from the otherwise fresh imagery of "mapping silence."

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("vocabulary of brick and bone"), moving with excellent rhythm. The line-level craft supports the magical tone without lapsing into purple prose, though the final simile is slightly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally evocative, but the verbatim repetition of three distinctive prompt phrases ("velvet garden," "tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve") within a short word count reads as a structural artifact rather than a purposeful refrain, creating a scaffold/loop effect.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is fluid and dense, but relies on several heavy-handed metaphors (ink mixed with "resolve," expression carved in "official stone," understanding "bloomed cold") that border on purple. These artifacts distract from the otherwise clean imagery. The pacing is well-managed through the motif of the dripping water.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm is generally smooth, but the prose suffers from "telling" over "showing," particularly with the "richly perceptive" label. The insertion of technical phrases required by the prompt disrupts the lyrical texture, reading as artificial scaffold rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Polished prose with strong rhythm, marred by physical implausibility (glass warping/melting in a cold wreck) and occasional overwrought metaphors ("strings of pearls").

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is competent but suffers from "purple" phrasing and the forced integration of prompt elements ("scintillatingly somber"). The pacing is controlled, though the density of wisdom-dispensing dialogue drags the momentum and reduces subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is solid, with strong imagery ("poisoned snow," "dark inclusions") and good rhythm. There are no significant prose artifacts or loops, though the exposition within the shredded letters is a bit heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with excellent imagery ("barnacle made of stone"), though repetitive motif tagging (cobalt, prophet) and occasional filter verbs ("realized," "thought") slightly drag the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery. There are occasional lapses into "purple" description or convenient phrasing ("dawn arriving like forgiveness"), but the line-level craft generally supports the intended atmosphere well.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from reliance on adjective-noun pairings and abstract summaries of state ("logically committed, emotionally certain"). These telling artifacts flatten the immediate physical experience of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.6)
    While the rhythm is controlled, the verbatim repetition of the phrase "softly purposeful" (lines 14 and 45) creates a mechanical artifact. Additionally, opening with "prayer carved in stone" leans toward purple prose, and the text occasionally prioritizes explanation over immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. The only minor slip is the prompt-mandated phrase "fortified vulnerability," which reads as a slightly abstract label, though the surrounding context supports it well.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished but dense with modifier-heavy constructions and oxymoronic pairings ("vibrant hush," "gentle cacophony") that draw attention to the writing style over the substance. Line-level momentum is generally good, though the aesthetic is slightly ornamental and adjective-reliant.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is generally polished and rhythmic, there is a significant overuse of the vague placeholder "something" (8 instances: "something like music," "something beyond mere survival," "something just beyond comprehension," etc.), which dilutes the precision of the abstract concepts. This lexical crutch reduces the impact of the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished with strong phrases like "mathematical residue" and "cascading backups." A few moments verge on melodrama ("humanity's childhood") or technical redundancy ("photons and projection"), but the rhythm generally supports the story's contemplative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished but leans into abstract imagery that blurs visualization ("shadows... shot through with something like starlight"). The final image ("reflection of two families remembering how to choose") collapses metaphor into literal description in a way that strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and evocative imagery ("ivory tip worn smooth"). The prose rhythm supports the contemplative pacing without dragging, avoiding scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    Polished rhythm, but marred by abstract telling ("passionate in his subtlety") and clichéd imagery ("tears catching like dewdrops") that weakens the emotional precision.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong phrasing like "architecture of pause" and "forest of our certainties." Information density is good, and there are no significant loop artifacts or scaffold sentences disrupting the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from adjectival clutter and forced similes ("like a prayer," "tentative as deer"). Specific prompt phrases are inserted as clumsy labels ("perceptively calm attention," "earnest whimsy") rather than being woven into the fabric of the description, creating visible seams in the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery. There is a slight tendency toward abstraction ("liminal space," "certainty," "doctrine") and heavy personification ("books dreamed") that occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptional, with high information density and striking, original imagery like "joints becoming architecture." The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the "unspooling" fog, and the physical details (chalk dust, cold stone) anchor the abstract concepts. There are no significant artifacts or wasted motions; every line advances the atmosphere or the argument.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("organs of a clockwork heart"). There are minor artifacts of redundancy ("changelessly constant") and moments where the description leans toward the melodramatic ("luminous ache"), but the line-level momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished but overwrought ("hymning of mundane moments," "pulsing with a stillness"). "Decisively kind" is a weak tell that bypasses character work; metaphors like the "worn case familiar as her own heartbeat" are stock.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with good information density. The description of the shadows transforming into luminous threads is a highlight, though a few phrases ("spoons had bent reality") jar slightly against the serious tone.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished and competent, with some striking images like the "tooth pulsed... warm as a star." However, the reliance on filter verbs ("She found herself," "Marianne recognized," "Marianne wanted to") creates unnecessary distance in key moments. Some similes, such as "cracked open like an egg," feel slightly standard compared to the vividness of the garden description. Line-level momentum is good, but the filtering dampens the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished with good rhythm, though it occasionally leans into "purple" description ("grotto seemed to breathe with approval"). Scaffolding phrases like "As memories resurface, the mind becomes..." act as tell-y transitions that could be smoothed into the action.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally competent but leans into abstract phrasing ("organic ambiguity," "binary certainty") and clichés ("tsunami of judgment") that weaken the imagery. The phrase "honeyed hush" feels tonally dissonant with the damp, cold atmosphere of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm is smooth, but the prose relies on abstract nouns and familiar similes ("breath against glass," "settled into her chest like a stone") rather than fresh, concrete imagery. The reliance on explaining the "shapes" of hope creates a telling-heavy texture that reduces density.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong phrasing like "music as architecture." A few clichés ("pressed against his ears like velvet") and filter verbs slightly mar the otherwise clean execution.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally polished but relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("patient precision," "deliberate slowness") and abstract summaries ("physically demonstrating patience") instead of concrete action. These stylistic choices slow the momentum without adding necessary density.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery (“bloomed... like flowers”). A few moments of purple phrasing and the fragment-style pacing in the climax (“Ticked. Clicked.”) feel slightly manufactured but generally work well.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose density is high with excellent imagery ("shingled hush," "rivulets still carved"). The integration of the awkward prompt phrase "boundary-lessly" is handled as gracefully as possible. The baleen/whalebone metaphor is dense but rewarding.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and polished with strong rhythmic control; the imagery of the rain and wood grain is exceptionally handled. The repetition of "rust-hued peace" to bookend the piece feels slightly mechanical, but line-level craft is otherwise high.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from abstract metaphor stacking ("Regret tasted like cloud-mist") that reduces sensory immediacy. The explicit dismissal of world rules ("physics meant nothing") acts as a scaffold that weakens the line-level authority.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong imagery ("blue light across cracked marble"). However, the text relies too heavily on filter verbs and scaffolding ("She realized," "She understood why," "That's when she saw it," "She found herself"), which distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience and slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished but leans into "purple" description ("suspended time," "ghost of what she might have become"). The required phrase "petrichor nostalgia" creates a slightly awkward semantic construction, and there is a reliance on heavy adverbs ("excruciatingly") that dulls the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is high-density and evocative ("claiming dominion," "crystalline blue"), with strong rhythm and no scaffold artifacts. The imagery effectively supports the "unseen reality" motif.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but relies on familiar literary metaphors ("gray cotton," "reluctant flower"). While the sentences flow well, the density of figurative language sometimes distances the reader from the physical action of untying the knots, prioritizing poetic effect over concrete friction.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmical with high density. It leans occasionally into purple phrasing ("landscape of lonesome splendor," "dying stars") which distances the reader slightly, but the line-level craft is otherwise strong and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("industrial percussion into melody"). However, there is a tendency toward overwriting ("precise chemical composition of wonder"), and the repetition of "bitterly sweet" and "trembling/quaking" draws attention to itself as artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant artifacting is present: three distinct, complex phrases ("unyielding compassion," "gracefully alert," "kelp-drift peace") are repeated verbatim or near-verbatim within this short text, creating a distracting, looped template cadence that ruins prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is fluid but marred by clunky phrasing ("realistically imaginative mind") and some clichés ("cast more questions than light," "broken promises"). While readable, the line-level craft lacks the density and freshness required for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but leans into "purple" description that prioritizes sound over clarity ("mist remembering water," "quiet sigh of falling petals"). While the density is high, the reliance on abstract poetic metaphors slightly distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is strong, with clear imagery and good rhythm ("migration patterns written in orange and black"). While "thundering calm" feels like a forced oxymoron, the general prose quality is high. There is a tendency toward filter verbs ("She felt him," "She understood") that distances the reader slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally high-quality with strong imagery ("calcified finger," "pressing pause on her own heartbeat"). A few phrases lean slightly purple ("searing reverie of creation," "ethical diligence that had consumed her life"), but the rhythm and sentence variety are strong. The mechanics of the carving are described with good tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose flows with a good rhythm and manages information density well, avoiding unnecessary scaffolding. However, the climax relies on the cliché "something clicked," and occasional mixed metaphors distract from otherwise competent line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("fractured shards," "blade of volcanic glass"). Momentum is generally good, though the phrase "groundedly imaginative" is clunky and reads as a forced prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, fitting the musical subject matter. There is a tendency toward density in figurative language ("pressed... like a living thing," "weaving... like smoke") which occasionally slows momentum, but the line-level craft is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with excellent rhythm and imagery ("heart ceasing to beat"). Minor artifacts like the redundant "shattered porcelain shards" (shards imply shattered) and the "terrible, marvelous" cliché slightly reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong image systems ("sedimentary layers," "candlelight catch its teeth"). A few phrases lean towards abstraction ("represented everything Marcus believed about truth"), but the rhythm and density are generally high-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from "purple" tendencies (adverb-adjective pairings like "expectantly resigned") and abstract telling that dulls the imagery ("casual cruelties"). There is a reliance on filtering and summarizing emotional states instead of grounding them in concrete, specific behaviors.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished and readable, but relies on "telling" (e.g., "informally wise") and filter verbs that distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong imagery ("copper coils still warm," "understanding blooming"). Rhythm is controlled, though some lines lean slightly purple ("shades of nectar and gold") given the didactic context.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished but relies on filter verbs ("She felt it," "Mara understood") and explicit telling during key moments. The phrase "inadvertently profound" is a clunky adverb-adjective stack that distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished, with strong rhythmic control and evocative imagery ("mortar," "colonize"). A minor deduction applies for the visible insertion of prompt phrases like "cascading revelations" and "welcome nuance" as summary labels, which occasionally disrupt the otherwise immersive prose texture.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished but occasionally leans into overwrought metaphor ("symphony of variables," "seeds of future success"). The rhythm is solid, though the reliance on abstract nouns in the descriptions of the proofs dampens the immediacy slightly. The final line provides a clean, rhythmic snap.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery like the "lung" greenhouse and "coin pressed against dirty cloth." There is a slight tendency toward filter verbs ("She saw," "Mara felt") which distances the visions slightly, but the overall density and flow are high-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is high-quality with strong rhythm and density. Imagery is sharp and functional ("cascading water crystallized," "carry your purpose like portable luggage"), avoiding scaffold and clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "tide exhaled its slow retreat." The integration of required phrases is mostly smooth, though "neatly inventive" feels slightly passive. The description of the "four-dimensional knots" and "crystallized light" leans slightly on genre abstraction but functions well within the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose suffers from clichés (&quot;silk dragging across gravel&quot;) and overwritten similes (&quot;materializing... like condensation&quot;). The repeated use of the clunky compound modifier &quot;photographically cursed&quot; impedes the rhythm and immediacy of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong imagery ("skeletal apple trees"). There is some tendency toward overwriting in the descriptions of the storm ("howling mouth of foam and fury"), and the prompt words ("dubbing," "fractal generating") jut out slightly against the otherwise organic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("bleached turtle bone"), though a few metaphors feel slightly decorative ("dread pooled... like shadow-water"). The density is good, but some moments rely on "writerly" phrasing ("obsessive attention") rather than showing the behavior directly.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished and readable, though occasionally prone to abstractions ("heartbreaking and magnificent"). The forced insertion of prompt phrases ("emotionally rational") creates rhythm breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    A significant grammatical error disrupts the story's climax: "Marcus carefully wrest it" (using the base form instead of the past tense "wrested"). Additionally, phrasing like "hushed blaze quality" is awkward and adjectival. These slips in craft undermine the otherwise polished tone at critical junctures.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally functional but suffers from moments of overwriting and forced phrasing (e.g., "pulse with significance," "swallowed"). The insertion of specific prompt phrases ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") creates grammatical awkwardness and mixed metaphors that disrupt the reading flow in otherwise clean sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like "stars emerged like pin-holes in black paper." The phrase "luminous torment" appears twice; while effective as a thematic bracket, its repetition in a short space risks feeling slightly heavy-handed. Otherwise, the line-level craft is polished and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, successfully balancing scientific terminology with poetic imagery. However, the text relies on labeling emotions ("bleak exhilaration") rather than evoking them, and some phrasing leans toward the overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.8)
    The specific phrase "brilliant dimness" is repeated three times (paras 9, 13, 17), creating a noticeable text artifact that stalls momentum. The prose occasionally drifts into purple abstraction ("pulsed like forgotten messages") without grounding in concrete sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "telling" metaphors and category errors, such as mixing concrete and abstract nouns ("salt and sorrow"). Phrases like "destroyed her soul" and "dying light" lean toward melodrama and cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from dense adjectival phrasing and mixed metaphors (a voice cannot be "furrowed"). The reliance on abstract summaries of emotion ("palpable" distrust, "gratitude that needed no words") dulls the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is competent but occasionally leans into cliché ("dawn paint the horizon," "sandcastle meeting tide"). Several required phrases are jammed into sentences without sufficient syntactic blending, disrupting the otherwise smooth rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished with good rhythm. "Delicately robust" is an awkward oxymoron that disrupts the description, likely due to prompt insertion. The ending image is strong, though the dialogue occasionally drifts into sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic with strong imagery. However, the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases like "cosmic intimacy" and "paradoxically steady" draws attention to itself as a construction, slightly breaking the immersive spell.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high, with strong density and rhythm ("echoed in her bones," "choked her with its beauty"). A few images lean toward the familiar ("moonlight pooled like spilled mercury," "truth hurts"), preventing a top-tier score, but the repetition of "I will be here" functions effectively as a rhythmic spell.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished with high density, but persistent filter verbs ("Mei could feel," "She believed," "She felt herself rising") distance the reader from the immediate experience. The phrase "ghostly resolve" is used as a frame but verges on repetitive labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose demonstrates strong rhythm and distinct imagery ("tiny green star," "vibrant hush"), creating a polished textural experience. Minor issues include the cliché "evaporated like morning mist" and some repetitive phrasing around the intuitive "knowing," but line-level craft is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lexical repetition is an issue, with "luminous" appearing four times and forms of "glow" six times in a short space. Prompt-mandated phrases like "calmly inventive" are inserted as modifiers rather than organically woven into the prose flow.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally evocative ("drifted like silk"), but the root word "friction" or "frictionless" appears over ten times in a short space, creating a repetitive lexical drumbeat. This redundancy blunts the elegance of the descriptions and distracts from the otherwise polished imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    While rhythmically competent, the prose is weighed down by a high density of purple metaphors ("lightning like a prayer," "electrical veins," "bureaucratic ink"). This persistent overwriting obscures the scene's immediate reality in favor of performance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery ("fractured beams," "cathedral of questions") that supports the tone. The pacing is controlled, allowing the "dignified chaos" to manifest in the sentence rhythm. Minor tendency toward purple phrasing ("eternal question to the stones"), but it fits the genre conventions.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high, with dense, evocative imagery ("liquid silver," "warped library table") that advances the atmosphere. The "sardine can" simile serves as a strong anchor for the visual reality of the scene. Rhythm varies nicely between the dialogue and the descriptive passages, maintaining propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery in the opening and closing beats. However, prompt-mandated phrases like "strategically creative" are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the rhythmic flow. There is a tendency to tell rather than show at pivotal moments ("ritual of steely longing"), which flattens the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("weight like a tiny sun") that supports the tone. Information density is high, and the pacing flows well. A few adjectival choices feel slightly heavy ("troublingly thin," "desperate beauty"), but the overall line-level craft is precise and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from a density of abstract metaphors ("shades of apology," "blue of healing") and elevated diction that obscures rather than reveals. The heavy reliance on figurative language in nearly every paragraph violates the economy bias, resulting in a polished but overwrought texture.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses physics, biology, and emotion (“Neutron stars were themselves evidence of catastrophe…”). Figurative layer is disciplined—no mixed metaphors; “tiny mirrors,” “perfect decay” extend the same optic metaphor. Occasional scaffold: “she had always preprocessed reality…” repeats the tag line; minor. Final third is artifact-free, cadence slows to match dusk light. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied, with purposeful enjambment in canyon descriptions and clipped clauses during discovery; high information density in most lines. Occasional elevated diction (‘drifting resonance’, ‘luminous glass artist’) edges toward lyric self-consciousness, but metaphorical coherence survives; no loops or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “fractured into a thousand prisms by the ice storm” does world, weather, and metaphor in one stroke. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors, no filler. A single scaffold echo (“the ocean had taken… the ocean keeps”) is purposeful refrain, not loop. Final line lands clean, recharging “frequency” as both sonic and existential.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density—each sentence advances stakes or aura (“lighthouse lens… fractured into a constellation of sharp-edged fragments” does double duty as image + foreshadowing). Figurative language is spare, marine, and coherent; no mixed metaphors. Final line lands by image, not explanation. Opening line anchors voice and mystery in one stroke. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“sound rippling like water finding its level”). Paragraph cuts are purposeful—each advances knowledge or stakes. Clean grammar, no scaffolding; high information density without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is image-dense but purposeful; only brief scaffold (“she felt it again—”) that could be trimmed. Metaphors stay coherent (water, threads, lanterns) and payoff in closure. No synonym loops or register drift. Final paragraph achieves charged poise via parallel cadence without drumbeat monotony. Proofing clean; one hyphen tweak needed.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is high-density lyric with zero paraphrase loops; each sentence either advances root-motion or re-specifies light. Metaphors are vegetal-physics hybrids that stay coherent: “crystallized light” later reifies as cooling mineral fragment. Rhythm modulates from luxuriant carpet sentences to fragment shards at climax, mirroring photo disintegration. Only minor slip: “yellowed more each day” is cliché cluster amid otherwise fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence length contracts in high-tempo window exit, lengthens in reflective planting. No loops or scaffold; information density high—“keys arranged by piano octaves” does world, character, and plot work in one phrase. Metaphors stay physically coherent: seeds splitting concrete, roots in impossible places. Only minor over-writing: “staggering grace” appears twice; second use feels self-conscious, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level density is high: each sentence advances image or causality (“cells began to die and divide simultaneously, their death-songs mixing with their birth-cries”). Metaphors are consistent (acoustic / metallurgical) and paid off in the forge. No scaffold loops, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with aurora swells then contracts at drop, propelling closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned early, so the lyric escalation reads intentional rather than purple. One minor scaffold: “pooled thick as honey” and “thick as honey” idea repeat across two adjacent sentences—subtracts a hair. Otherwise, information density stays high, every line doing double duty.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence alternates between molten flow and crystalline snap without algorithmic pattern. Metaphors stay within glass physics (passion consume art, glass like trust) maintaining coherence, no mixed vehicles. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or emotional grain. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with luminous specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Metaphors (“flaking gold leaf booklet… like captured sunlight”) stay coherent and physically plausible. High information density: single lines deliver sensory, thematic, and plot data simultaneously. No artifact touches the closure beat; prose propulsion remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences deliver loop count, emotional shift, and environmental change. No filter-verb clusters; “he understood” is earned culmination, not explanation. Metaphors are spare and physical—“ripples in the twilight air”—avoiding mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes: long frozen descriptions, short explosive violin passage, then quiet close; no template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; no filler verbs or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“cage unlocking,” “door opening onto stars”—each metaphor pairs with a concrete action. Sentence rhythm modulates: staccato when she slides the ticket, open cadence for the final image. One microscopic scaffold: “the resonant hush of shared understanding” repeats the noun phrase from earlier; trimming one instance would sharpen the cadence yet does not mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold; every sentence advances image or stake. Figurative layer is spare—only “light like broken teeth”—and that simile reappears in the marbles, earning its place. Rhythm accelerates into the final paragraph where nouns stack like seeds. No filter verbs, no synonym loops; “polishing” gains meaning each repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene beats—long sentences for twilight calm, clipped fragments at reveal. Figurative language is sparse and coherent: “time as crystalline facets” is taught early and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Information density high; each sentence advances calibration, perception, or stakes. Minor −0.1 for two adjacent “they” openers in final paragraph, not touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes: long sentence for Pachelbel, staccato fragments for the reveal. No mixed metaphors; “lanterns…orchestra of light” is single sustained image. One paraphrase loop—“water lapping at the third rung…water lapping at her waist” (adjacent paragraphs) −0.2. Otherwise high density; every clause adds sensory or causal data.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often advances plot, character, and metaphor simultaneously (“I taught it to ignore its own doubts”). No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (frost/illustration/uncertainty chain). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene temperature. Opening and closing lines bookend the arc: frost patterns → clouds under uncertain forecast, a mirrored image that recharges motif.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—e.g., “beads clicked...worn smooth by decades of phantom workers” fuses sound, touch, and backstory. No loops or filler; modifiers are scarce, nouns and verbs concrete. Metaphors stay mechanical-religious (“rosary prayers”) and never mixed. One tiny scaffold: “the truth has weight” is接近抽象摘要 but immediately anchored to stomach-stone image, so momentum recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from terse clauses to liquid cascades; no two openings repeat. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor geologically accurate—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one line (“history composted itself”) performs decay, irony, and world-rule. Zero loops or scaffold; final line’s inverted syntax recharges “letting go.”

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm: long sentence sets forest dusk, then short pluck—“She played another note”—mimics cardiac pacing under eclipse. No metaphor pile-ups; “starlight looks” is lone compressed compound, justified by child’s wonder. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances light, temperature, or breath. Copy-clean: no tense drift, pronoun confusion, or scaffold sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, and info-dense: one sentence = texture + backstory + emotional tilt. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and paid off (“industrial bones” mirrored by later mounting). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, avoiding explanation. Minor over-alliteration in “bronze quiet of late afternoon” is tolerable.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences vary in length to mimic lamp sweep. No synonym loops or template cadence. Mixed metaphors avoided—beam as courier is single, sustained vehicle. One minor scaffold: “She began writing” followed by listing three fortunes could compress, but momentum sustains. Opening and closing lines are strong, the latter recharging motif. UV-reactive rice-paste and blink code lend tactile specificity. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax; stacked participial phrases serve the looping cadence rather than clutter. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Information density stays high: each loop layer, breath, or daub advances pattern and stakes. One minor scaffold ripple—“decorated these pockets carefully” echoes earlier decorate—but the final silence line lands clean, so artifacts never touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density: “translating cosmic radiation into musical notation” does world-building and character backstory in one stroke. Metaphors stay coherent (spire as finger, nautilus as score) and don’t clog the climax. Minor scaffold: “she remembered… she remembered” anaphora is purposeful, not loop. Clause variation good; no synonym churn. Copy clean. Final line lands by image, not explanation. No artifact touches closure; eligible for low 8s, not 9+, because two adjacent metaphors (“visual symphony,” “mathematical rhythm”) could have been pruned for even tighter cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: “wet stone catching the last defiant rays” does three jobs (setting, time, character defiance). Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors. A few template stems (“She was… she felt…”) appear but not in closure beat. No loops, no synonym churn. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm mirrors theme: sentences lengthen in calm, stutter under discovery, end on a single image. No loops or scaffold; “filaments of hush” is first metaphor, not repeated. High information density—one sentence layers cavern history, Oskar’s deafness year, and talismanic needle. Final line avoids drum-beat monotony by varying cadence: “audible only to those who’d learned to listen with something deeper than ears.”

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often layers object history, sensory cue, and emotional charge—“pre-quarantine era, designed for carrier pigeons, complete with the faded stamp…” No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors are storm-consistent: “barriers breathe” links to pressure intervals. Final line is crisp, propulsive, resolves by image. Minor paraphrase tic: “listened to the fountain’s gentle murmur as dusk painted…” is familiar phrasing, but it occurs in low-pressure opening, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths visually swell then contract with the color spiral. Information density is high—“crystal perfume vial hung from a silver chain around her neck” does triple duty: prop, marriage relic, future light-film screen. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory angle or emotional nuance. Metaphors stay coherent (light as scent) and do not violate the world’s physics; no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers image and idea without synonym churn. Figurative logic stays consistent—rope as clock, starlight as thread—no mixed metaphors. High density: “molecules aligned by terror and determination” does world-building, character, and physics in one stroke. Read-aloud cadence modulates from long breath of opening to staccato spiral laying, closing on hushed monosyllabic leave.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, acoustics, emotion: “apple trees grew sideways through the flooded foundation, their branches breaking the waterline to bloom in defiance.” No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is singular. Minor purple flicker—“amber horizon,” “chronic hush”—but pattern is taught early and paid off. Closure line—“a single fruit dropping into water, the sound carrying perfectly, magnificently clear”—is crisp, uncluttered, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density throughout; sentences twin sensory and conceptual work (“The fragrance chemist’s blotter petal lay in her palm…”). Two minor loops—“counterfeit” thrice in 30 words; “half-truths” echoed without new angle—just avoid penalty threshold. Metaphors are coherent (amber as cupped hands of flame). Final third is clean; no artifact touches closure. Read-aloud rhythm varied.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is largely smooth: strong verb choices (“echoed,” “wheeled”), concise scaffolding, no mixed metaphors. Occasional soft filters (“felt,” “seemed”) sneak in during emotional peaks but do not cluster. One paraphrase loop: “thank you for bringing that envelope” idea is iterated three times in closing paragraph; trimmed once would sharpen cadence. No artifacts touch the closure image; final sentence lands cleanly with stellar choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “a prayer frozen in glass” packs metaphor without mixed-vehicle clutter. Rhythm modulates from languid orchard pacing to urgent marsh discovery, then to hymnal close. One scaffold trace: “the community gathered each evening, sharing stories and songs” is slightly generic; tighter specificity would lift the peak. No loops or synonym churn; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Sentences multitask: “Between the bronze towers…reflecting the giant’s slow, rhythmic breathing” sets place, tone, and stakes in one sweep. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor paid off (“loops of her infinity pendant” = echo twins). No scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors. One near-purple phrase—“syrup-slow droplets”—is earned by the time-stretch context and immediately justified by the next sensory beat, so waived.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lyrically compressed yet propulsive: every sentence does double duty—description advances metaphorical logic (“roots drinking from pools fed by stalactites” fuses geology and nurture). No paraphrase loops; each apple-blossom mention adds sensory layer. Metaphor coherence holds: glass eyes → sight → parallel vision → unsolvable topology, all vehicles obey internal physics. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she wondered if… she felt certain…”) in one line, but it sits in low-pressure beat; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences perform double duty: “She lifted the nearest lid carefully, and her breath caught” simultaneously shows caution and emotional hit. No synonym loops; each metaphor is singular and precise (“library’s sense memory”). Filter verbs appear only when motivated by her cautious noticing. The final line’s quiet cadence lands without scaffold, recharging “sapphire hush.”

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; each sentence moves (description → implication → next step). No synonym loops or template cadence; only one paraphrase pair (“convergence…convergences”) but it serves thematic echo. Figurative language is selective and paid off: rain-as-neurons returns as star-mirror neurons in the pool. Tense stable, pronoun clean, opening and closing lines book-end with luminous precision.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density with zero paraphrase loops; figurative language is selective (“shadows grew teeth” earns its keep); rhythm accelerates with the pearl’s spin and snaps into short declaratives at the void reveal—no scaffold, no mixed metaphors at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean, with high density: single sentences layer sensory data, emotional calculus, and world fact (“rain-darkened wood planks steam in the returning sun”). No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors. The only minor loop is the twice-used “seventeen years of boxes / seventeen years of waiting,” but the reprise serves cadence rather than padding. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, propelling rather than decorating.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. High information density: “validation she couldn’t explain” advances both plot and emotion. A few metaphors verge on decorative (“starlit cathedral”) but none contradict physics or dull closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; props track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes: opening slow panoramic, mid-section staccato under vertigo, closing with quiet cadence. Sentence variety avoids template; no three identical stems detected. Information density high—“their ancient migration paths cutting through waters she’d studied for decades” compresses career, skepticism, and setting. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors (cupped hands, braided rope) stay consistent without muddled logic.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: sentence length modulates, openings vary, no scaffold loops. Figurative language is selective—three extended metaphors total—each tied to POV bias (serpent fields, paper-fold reality, poison bloom). No mixed metaphors or register drift; technical phrases (“spatial coordinates keep shifting”) stay within Cassius’s lexicon. A single paraphrase echo (“dimensions are revolting…refusing their ordained positions”) costs a hair of propulsion, but it occurs early and does not recur near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Opening sentence marries metaphor and anchoring in one stroke. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“liquefied rigid thinking,” “chrome instruments gleamed”). One paraphrase loop detected (“deathly vitality” repeated in similar cadence within 30 words) but occurs in low-pressure exposition; closure line untouched. Metaphors stay coherent under mortuary lighting.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence layers image and idea (“blossoms remember being large”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One clause—“their petals impossibly large, each bloom the size it would have been had the tree grown full-height”—is syntactically front-heavy, a hairline drag in the peak descriptive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances archive, atmosphere, or causal linkage. Metaphors stay physically loyal—“layers of replacement” mirrors actual container stacking. High-density beats: “toys still wrapped in manufacturer’s plastic” collapses origin, abandonment, and Maya’s own shrink-wrapped identity in one line. Final line cadence mirrors tide inhalation, releasing reader on lifted metal breath. Minor slip: “systematic erasure of what had been” leans abstract, but immediately grounded by next container detail.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses with musical cadence; sentence openings vary to mimic bow sweeps. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught early (“forgotten promise”) and paid off at closure. No mixed metaphors; “swirls of turquoise and gold” stays visually consistent. High information density: one sentence locates time, place, emotional stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; “unfinished” recurs with accruing weight, not redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical, with strong verbs—“speedboats cutting aggressive wakes,” “music swelled”—and only one paraphrase loop (“constant motion, constant adaptation, constant refusal”) that reads as intentional incantation. Metaphors stay coherent: barnacles as gentrification, carousel horses as compass needles. No filter-verb stacks or purple overload. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: each sentence layers technical detail, memory, and emotional charge. Figurative “cathedral of stone” and “phantom breeze” are sparing, appropriate to lyric mode. One template cadence (“Chen…Chen…Chen…”) in final paragraph flirts with monotony but aligns with countdown tension. Zero paraphrase loops; closure line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is near-invisible: high information density without pad. Metaphors are spare and functional—“mist rolled… like breath through lungs” sets respiratory rhythm for the depot. No mixed vehicles; refraction physics stays consistent. One loop only: “making the broken world whole again” echoes earlier “making broken things whole,” but it is the thematic reprise, not artifact churn, and lands in closure beat where repetition earns its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is spare—tightening metaphor of “heartbeat” stays coherent. Minor scaffold: “Left foot, right foot, pause” repeated twice for effect, not loop. High information density; each paragraph advances pattern or stakes. No artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language scarce but precise—“kelp like funeral shrouds”—and never clusters. Information density high: one sentence can merge light refraction, addiction, and temple history. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Copy clean except one typo “deadened” for “dead-weighted,” negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates: short declarative spikes at discovery (“He stepped through”) alternate with longer tidal sentences that mimic surf against reef. Metaphors are few but precise; no mixed vehicles. Minor paraphrase loop—“thread this labyrinth with their own stories / thread his own story through the labyrinth”—but it occurs mid-story and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is mostly clean, high density: “temperature dropped like a stone into dark water” does double sensory work. One mixed-metaphor risk—“wedding gown the color of cremation smoke”—remains vivid and coherent. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Opening and closing sentences frame and resolve with cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language (“roots coiled around skulls like careful fingers”) is sparse, apt, never piled into purple. Information density high: one sentence often does two jobs—“She lifted it carefully, dirt cascading from its hollow center” reveals object, action, and sensory fallout. Only micro-loop: “She would stay, she decided” is immediate paraphrase of prior clause; a −0.2 nudge, not closure-touching.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm breathes with tension: three-beat anaphora of “why she’d…” compresses exposition without stall. Concrete nouns (ebony, brass, smog) dominate; adjectives serve not decorate. One paraphrase loop—“the dignity of stamps, the journey through human hands” —redundant but short; no closure contamination. Clean grammar, vivid specificity, high info density; minimal figurative clutter keeps slot-drop image sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “cobalt-shadowed courtyard” collapses color and light into one modifier; “echoed silence” renders the conspirators’ pause. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or tension. Metaphors stay physically coherent (flame as signal, embroidery as map). Final line’s “history prepared to bend” offers a crisp, metaphorical snap that recharges “cobalt” and “flame” without overwriting. Proofing is clean; tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Information density high—each line moves image or emotion (e.g., “shard had its own history of catching tears”). One mixed metaphor “arthritic fingers” is vivid enough to pass. No loops or scaffold. Final paragraph avoids over-explanation; condensation fade is concrete, not abstract. commas clean; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is patterned early (“mist curled like a silk scarf”) and paid off in the coral reprise. High information density—every sentence advances atmosphere, interiority, or plot. Rhythm breathes with the anesthetic sweep, tightening into the final clause.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, motive, or atmosphere. Mixed metaphors avoided; “light dancing across cracked plaster like exposed film” is single extended vehicle. High information density: one sentence can layer pigment type, emotional state, and spatial relation. Occasional elevated phrase—“crystallized final moment”—reads earned by pensive tone; no artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty—action, atmosphere, and thematic echo—without paraphrase loops. Figurative language is spare and tied to craft: “conversation with the dead artist,” “nested like Russian dolls,” avoiding mixed metaphors. One scaffold risk: “vibrations that shouldn’t exist in dead pigment” edges toward poetic overwrite but is anchored in tactile surprise and justified by POV. Final paragraph breathes rather than explains, sustaining momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses: peppercorn rattle triplets, stacked participles mimic butterfly swirl. High information density: one sentence often layers scent, script, and stake. No loops or synonym churn; “gourd rattle seed” returns only with reweighted meaning. Figurative control tight—iridescent wings as living cipher—no mixed metaphors. Line propulsion breathes with accumulating members, accelerates into final cadence break. Micro-copy clean: pronouns unambiguous, tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops; no synonym churn. High density: “opal library caught the first light and refracted it into prismatic shadows” does world-building, stakes, and sensory texture in one breath. Metaphors remain coherent—light as “slow thoughts” extends to crystalline petals without physics violation. Final line “small candle of sound” is crisp, propulsive, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths create visual breaths. Information density is high—one sentence can layer ink origin, mineral scarcity, and Civilizational collapse. No mixed metaphors; the “symphony” conceit stays consistent. Occasional elevated diction—“prismatic refractions,” “orthography”—is justified by scholarly POV. Only minor scaffold: two adjacent “each” openers in paragraph 4, not repeated elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors physical motion—coiling, stretching, sketching—then tightens into shorter units at the unsealing beat. No paraphrase loops; “breathing” returns only twice, each time reweighted. Strong verbs (“exhaled,” “coiled,” “trembled”) minimize adverbs. One mixed metaphor near-miss: “voltage” beside ancient stones, but saved by tactile immediacy. Final line cadence—breathing, trembling, harmonize—lands without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often layers dust physics, memory trigger, and emotional charge. Zero paraphrase loops; only one scaffold phrase (“she continued her work”) could be cut. Figurative control holds to final line; no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates from long refracting sentences to the clipped final exchange; no template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned—light/void/wood triad—so it accrues rather than obscures. One micro-loop: “distance kept and distance closed” is a near-paraphrase yet serves as thematic hinge, forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, with high information density: one sentence often delivers setting, character beat, and world rule. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (“city… learning to dance”). Minor over-packaging in places (“shadowseam wonder,” “communion ending”) but artifacts do not obscure causality or dull the final image. Dialogue tags and attribution are clean; paragraphing breathes with scene rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “the emotions of these unmade moments felt lighter, more wistful” compresses metaphysics into tactile quality. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Figurative language is selective—two metaphors per beat at most—avoiding purple overload. Occasional elevated phrasing (“transliterate frantically”) is justified by her arcane vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm mirrors choreography—long sentences swell, then final line snaps to stillness. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent (crystalline petals, mercury gestures) and never muddles causal clarity. No scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors; moonstone dissolution is precise. Occasional elevated diction (“kinaesthetic poetry”) is earned by context; no artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere or insight (“mist still clung to water like breath on glass” does double sensory work). No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (glass, light, fracture). Sentence variety high—participial openings used sparingly and correctly. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence rises with ring expansion, softens with “disappeared.” No artifacts in closure beat; final line is crisp image.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; figurative language (moon-shadow on scars, light “getting in” through crack) is spare and pattern-paid. No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors, no register drift. Opening and closing lines frame stakes and recharged motif concisely. Minor tic: three “bargain” variants feel engineered, but do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; each sentence advances pattern, pressure, or image. Figurative vehicles (tide=time, gauge=destiny) stay mutually consistent and physically grounded. Information density is high—“spiral met the circle” encodes both math and emotion. A single mixed metaphor (“sound like wind through canvas, like her grandmother’s balloon”) is earned by the ballooning backstory, so no deduction touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lyrical but information-dense: one sentence often sets scene, advances plot, and textures atmosphere (“Above her, the prism parapet gleamed… becoming a tiny world of possibility”). Mixed-metaphor risk is avoided; vehicles stay optical/auditory. One minor scaffolding loop: “refracted colors, each droplet… becoming a tiny world of possibility” repeats the refraction idea in adjacent clauses, but the beat is low-pressure so clarity is not dulled. No artifacts touch the closure; final line is clean, image-driven, and cadenced.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lines carry double duty—portable cross / penitent’s cross—without purple overload. Rhythm accelerates through name-list anaphora then exhales into post-ritual silence. One paraphrase loop: ‘transparent…transparency’ near ritual intro costs −0.2. Otherwise clean propulsion, zero scaffold, metaphors cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence layers action, world-rule, and emotional state—“studying fissures like a cartographer reading ancient texts” simultaneously shows pose, metaphor, and authorial guilt. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentences start with varied parts of speech, propelling momentum. Figurative language is sparse and accurate; no mixed metaphors. Copy-clean: tense stable, pronouns clear, only one optional comma splice that reads as deliberate punch. Final line lands with imagistic brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; high information density (e.g., “Each strand represented a suppressed voice, a denied dream…”). No looped stems, mixed metaphors, or paraphrase restatement. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and payoff without scaffolding. Metaphor strings (“lullaby of conformity,” “beautiful corpse”) are purposeful and pattern-taught early; they pay off in the final sonic rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sure-footed read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Information density high—each sentence advances ethic or atmosphere. One mixed metaphor “strip away pretense and speak truths” is minor; otherwise vehicles stay coherent. Zero loops or scaffold, no artifact in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is artifact-free: no loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. “Blushing stillness” compresses color + silence into one charged noun phrase; “question mark” tower balances whimsy and threat without overwriting. Sentence rhythm accelerates at arrival, then settles into hush—propulsion matches emotional curve. High density: single clauses often handle image, motion, and theme simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors; sentences carry double duty—e.g., “molten bronze hissed and sang” advances both sound and material state. Paragraph cuts are surgical; removal of any one would collapse causal or emotional linkage. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by recharged image (“sound followed her up through the glacier”). Read-aloud ear test passes: rhythm modulates from slow braid to ringing release.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; information is dense without scaffold. Figurative language is controlled—“green so thick it felt like drowning in chlorophyll”—and never muddies causality. One paraphrase loop (“paths choose their walkers / walker and path”) is forgiven because it serves the thematic reprise at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, high-density: each sentence advances knowledge, tool, or atmosphere; no paraphrase loops detected. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“dusky harmony,” “bridge across millennia”). Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve via image, not abstraction. Minor scaffold: the phrase “encrypted devotion” is repeated twice; while purposeful, it edges toward template cadence but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is spare but precise: “resentment…calcified into destiny” crystallizes generational anger without purple flourish. Information density is high—one sentence can plant the box, reveal Mira’s 17-year wait, and foreshadow the pin’s symbolic load. Read-aloud ear test passes: the final “new student began her journey” lands with cadential lift, no mechanical template.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences vary in length and syntactic shape, propelling the ritual beat. Figurative layers (“frost that wouldn’t melt,” “cold fire”) recur with disciplined consistency, never crowding a single clause. Zero loops, zero scaffold; every line either advances paste application or tightens fog sync. Final line lands on a stark, image-driven clause that refracts earlier glass motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene tempo; sentence lengths ebb during the climb, tighten at the reveal. Occasional softeners (“seemed like,” “looked like”) could be pruned; near-duplicate “thinking machines… thinking she could modernize” repeats stem within two lines, a minor loop. Otherwise dense, propulsive, and free of mixed metaphor; the blossom-to-hands image lands clear and tactile. Final sentence avoids drumbeat by varying participial close.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (world-rule + character memory + emotional state). No loops; no scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—“fear itself had learned to phosphoresce” extends setting’s light-physics. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested, propulsive. Minor register spike: “conceptual repricing” is academic; tolerated because embedded in curator cognition.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    High-density lines (“shelves branching like neural pathways through stone and crystal”) perform atmosphere and world-rule in one stroke. Rhythm accelerates down the mountain, breathes at negotiation, re-tightens on exit—no template cadence. A single scaffold echo (“unheard symphony… symphony of what never was… symphony shifted”) is thematic recurrence, not loop; it pays off in harmonic re-orchestration at end.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences are dense yet transparent; metaphors (fog as “erasing fingers”) serve momentary perception without crowding. One paraphrase loop—“trapped and free, caught between what was and what might have been”—is redundant; trimming would sharpen. Otherwise clean, varied syntax, strong verbs, no scaffolding artifacts near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, no loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (description + world-rule cue). Figurative language is spare and precise—“sound like pages turning”—never clotted. One filter-verb cluster (“she understood now why…”) is tolerated because the insight is paid for by the preceding sensory overload. Clean copy, no artifacts near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose stays lean: “glass and teeth ache” compresses sensory overload. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors per high-pressure paragraph—preventing density bleed. No template cadence; sentence openings vary. Final line’s “bloom of hush” recycles earlier phrase with reweighted charge, acceptable echo.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “coincidences were prayers in disguise” compresses premise and stakes in one stroke. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles (thistle-down, frost flowers) stay botanical, coherent. Rhythm breathes—paragraph lengths visually echo tower spiral. Zero paraphrase loops; “shard of hush” is introduced once and propagated via implication. Opening and closing lines bookend with beacon imagery, satisfying ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but breathable: one sentence pans setting, character, and concept (“She pressed her palm against one formation and felt the echo of a child’s laughter, someone who would now be elderly if they still lived”). Figurative logic stays consistent—fog as architecture, memory as crystal—preventing metaphor muddle. No loops or synonym churn; the repeated “deepening hush” is purposeful cadence, not scaffold. The only micro-slip is “preemptively nostalgic weight,” a stacked modifier that could compress, but it occurs early and doesn’t touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; short chant fragments punctuate longer descriptive sentences. Information multi-tasking: primrose petals also signal time-of-day and emotional soften. No scaffold loops; “spinning…spinning” repetition is intentional pattern, not churn. Metaphors stay coherent (light/dark, bloom/close). Tense stable, pronouns clean. Final line is trim and image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Sentences often carry double duty (action + tide data). One soft filter-verb cluster—“he could foresee the coming tide”—but forgiven because it embeds his professional lens. No mixed metaphors; closure image retains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often flicks world-rule (“cloudvines… reaching toward earth instead of heaven”) while advancing motion. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breaths with escalation—short beats during aerial grab, expansive cadence at closure. Final line “She chose to sprout…” lands clean, recharging the confused-vine motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    High information density: each sentence advances glide, color, or breath. No scaffold; no mixed metaphors; figurative language (“liquid color,” “crystalline quality to the air”) stays within optical physics. Rhythm breathes with throttle reductions—long sentences stretch as speed drops. Copy-clean; pronouns track; no loops. Opening and closing lines book-end with crystal and hush, fulfilling pattern taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: scanner-crackle sentence delivers setting, tool, and stakes in one stroke. No filter-verb clusters or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates across waterfall breach and orchard approach, then slows for descent. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths create visual breath. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is dense but patterned—fire, ash, breath—so coherence survives. One paraphrase loop (“burned carefully…methodically…watching each connection flame”) is flagged but does not touch closure; density remains high elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty (description + causality) with high noun/verb specificity; no filter-verb clusters. Mixed metaphors ("sea of liquid light") are few and do not obscure closure. Occasional overwritten flourish ("symphonic brilliance") but not in peak beat; final line is clean, propulsive. Zero paraphrase loops; paragraph cut test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes—long sentences for dusk-light contemplation, clipped for crank-clicks. Metaphors are sparse, mixed only once (“understanding flooding like cold water”) yet paid off by emotional temperature. No loops, no synonym churn, no scaffolding. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes time/accountability without overwriting. A single participle opener is sequential, not simultaneous. High density, propulsion clean.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph cuts clean. However, figuration clusters heavily in the final beat (“shivering bliss”, “cosmic force”, “infinite patience”)—purple-tinged overwriting that slightly dulls closure image. Occasional scaffold: “he’d seen the strings… He’d fled… He’d begun” triple-anaphora could tighten. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn elsewhere; props tracked cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is mostly loop-free; only minor scaffold (“she began…she would contact”) that does not stall momentum. Figurative control high—“dust rivers,” “laugh…bells”—anchored in POV’s archival eye. Information density strong; one sentence often does two jobs (e.g., description + stakes). Final line cadence is purposeful, propelling exit.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, no scaffold loops; sentences open varied. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“constellations…testified to lies”). Information density high: one sentence often delivers setting, stakes, and emotional tilt—“The Ministry controlled the present…they couldn’t eliminate every trace.” No mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor filter verbs appear but serve psychic distance; they don’t stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, vivid, mostly free of loops; metaphor density is high but patterned and taught early (“branches spreading like veins”). One mixed metaphor—“joy that rose…like the first shoots”—is minor. Information density is strong; each paragraph advances knowledge or image. Final line lands with ringing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variety and sonic rhythm support momentum; no template cadence or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“ashes of burned certainty”)—never stacked. Information density high: one sentence often handles atmosphere, object state, and character insight. No scaffold; every paragraph advances knowledge or charge. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: parataxis under bellows (“rain still pattering…tin roof”) mimics percussion; longer caesura in final paragraph gives cadence of elegy. Single paraphrase loop spotted: “weight of names…the terrible gravity of the word ‘missing’” restates same idea; distance is one line so −0.2 only, well inside cap. Metaphors stay physically coherent—gold flows like solder, not like starlight. No filter-verb clusters, no template cadence, no overwriting. Opening and final lines are image-based, scaffolding-free.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level density is high: “pale threads” does triple duty for light, sound, fragility. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (sound = texture, tooth = predator instinct). Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts carry emotional charge. Filter verbs minimal and motivated. Only micro-slip: “modestly fearless” is abstract, but isolated.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density—each sentence carries sensory, emotional, and conceptual payload—yet no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. The single scaffold phrase “mathematics of mercy” is intentionally iterative, not accidental loop, and pays off in the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “platforms had once been tenement floors” embeds history inside spatial note. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the light/vision motif without contradiction. Opening and closing lines book-end with refracted sunset, creating purposeful ring structure. Clean grammar, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies via sentence length modulation; no template cadence detected. Information density is high: one sentence often layers external action with metaphysical stake (“feeling the weightless burden…prayer”). Figurative language is selective—three metaphors total—and avoids clutter in the peak discovery beat. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; “ceiling” recurs but each mention re-weights meaning, qualifying as purposeful return, not redundancy. Copy is clean; only one comma splice in inscription line, negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences perform double duty—each frost spiral both describes and rewrites the library’s physics. No scaffold loops; “glass fruit chimed discordantly” is the only figurative stack in peak beat and it is earned. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Clean grammar, precise spatial choreography as floor tilts and books tremble.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, conceptual work—“asteroid's baroque corridors twisted like frozen music, their gilt edges catching the amber light that now marked time's passage.” No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay consistent (frozen music / frozen water). Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“gleamed,” “clutched,” “traced”). One mixed-metaphor risk—“cathedrals from shards” reads cleanly because baroque architecture already established. Closure beat free of overwriting; final line earns rhythmic emphasis through monosyllables and hard consonants.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density lines (“sound folded back upon itself in endless, shimmering echoes”). One template cadence run (“He… then he…”) but outside peak beat. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold in “mahogany case gleaming dully” but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: “The lagoon opened before her like a secret kept in stone” does triple metaphoric, spatial, and emotional work. No synonym loops; each sensory noun is concrete. One mixed-metaphor risk: “sound itself had learned reverence” is saved by the next sentence’s acoustic science callback. Final line is a single muscular clause that propels reader into silence—zero scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “storm-tossed and defiant” packs motion + attitude in four words. Varied sentence lengths mimic surf surge; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. One strained metaphor “turbine’s steady roar” for rain is permitted under storm-heightened perception. Closure line “humming with the turbine-song of time itself” crystallizes earlier motif without overwriting—high information-to-word ratio sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information is multiplexed (“yellowed… but the flowers… remained luminous”). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—glass layers = perceptual filters = moonlight. One mixed image (“dawning hush” at dusk) is minor. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, advancing stakes and resonance. Clean copy; no typos or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “zeppelin’s shadow sprawled across ribbed sand” performs three jobs—visual, tactile, symbolic. Rhythm accelerates into short sentences at the lagoon reveal, matching breathless dread. No loops, no mixed metaphors; each image extends the memory-mirror concept. Opening and closing lines are resonant bookends.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (ex: “paper lanterns still swayed on rusted hooks, their torn rice paper fluttering like the breathing of something long dead” = atmosphere, metaphor, time stamp). No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“speculative reconstruction”) is voice-motivated for an alchemist. Final line lands with imaginal punch, no scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary from short percussive shards to looping chant-like clauses, mirroring the wax spirals themselves. No scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors; each image advances knowledge or atmosphere. “Velvet disquiet” and “golden curl, translucent and impossibly thin” are precise, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density high—one sentence often does three jobs (texture + world rule + emotional stake). Figurative language is controlled: mixed-metaphor risk at “hurricane that was also perfectly still” is justified by the paradox being ontologically real inside the vortex. Zero scaffold; no artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety tracks pressure: calm long sentences narrow to fragments during peak wind. Clean grammar; no synonym churn or filter-verb stacks. Information dual-loaded: “the rope wasn’t decoration—it was technology” advances both world rule and character credo. Only micro-loop: “stone chambers into the rock itself” could compress, but it occurs early and doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes—long sentence for galaxy spiral, short beat “She smiled.” No paraphrase loops; each meteor description adds new angle (iron, velocity, meaning). Mixed metaphor check: “flourishing stillness” is conceptually risky but paid off by botanical metaphor of dust blooming under mop. Minor scaffold: “watching and cleaning, cleaning and watching” is intentional chant; not penalized.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Information-dense lines—“wraps the oasis in necessary speech”—advance both texture and stake. Figurative layer is spare and coherent; no mixed metaphors. Parallax check clean: no synonym loops, no scaffold. One buried participle opener “Nestled inside…” is justified by breathless discovery. Closure sentence—“weight of unspoken words would find voice here”—lands with crystalline propulsion; line-level craft clears 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean and image-dense, every sentence advancing atmosphere or stake; only one soft paraphrase loop (“fragments of fixed time… fragments of the old world”) keeps it from 9+ perfection, but the closing line’s cadence is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense—rain-smoothed surface / bronze-green scatter—yet each image advances atmosphere or character. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new angle or pressure. One mixed risk: “symphony of ripples” edges purple, but the metaphor is brief and immediately grounded by the boy’s arrival. Final paragraph cadence slows to match the mirror-stillness, tightening closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “limestone that breathed moisture and harbored entire ecosystems” fuses geology and biology in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances either remodel progress or sensory re-calibration. Metaphors are consistent—copper as veins, orchard as translation device—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image (“added her final breath to that ancient dialogue”) that recharges “brazen calm.” Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” is earned by prior material. Proofing clean; no typos or tense slips. Artifact-free in final third, so 9-band remains open.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Figurative language is spare but precise: “voice like wind through bronze bells” teaches timbre without purple drift. Information density high—“fossilized resin containing a perfectly preserved insect from an epoch before humanity learned to look upward” does triple world-building duty. No register drift; scientific diction stays inside Elara’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is compact and image-dense yet fluid: “wood slick with evening dew” does triple duty—texture, risk, temporal marker. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances seed, setting, or memory. Figurative control holds even at peak (“submerged concord” stays consistent with brackish mixing). One near-purple moment—“vastness of darkening water”—but it is POV-colored and brief, not touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; no filler verbs or paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors (“iron cancer” beside “metal bones”) stay coherent within salvage ontology. Opening line anchors stakes and voice; final line recharges “distance” and “grooves” without repeating words. One near-overwrite: “tinted revelations poured from his speaker in waves of static and voice”—“tinted” is slightly decorative, but the synesthesia fits the cylinder’s altered medium and doesn’t blur causality.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphor vehicles stay consistent (compass, map, star-paths). One paraphrase loop (“silence itself seemed to reverberate” echoing “echoed silence”) slightly dulls momentum. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; final image is uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid mechanical stems. Metaphors stay coherent—sky as brass, laughter as thawing ice—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence can anchor place, sensory cue, and emotional charge. Minor paraphrase loop “secrets are meant to flow like water / give them one in return” costs −0.2, but clarity and closure beat remain untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes—“she spelled out the gestures she had witnessed” packs witness, method, and motive into one clause. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay internally coherent (light as absence, dust as hope). Filter verbs avoided; perception is direct—“the board’s black and white squares caught whatever light filtered through.” Final line re-illuminates the missing pawn motif without metaphorical stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent—mercury, glass, feather, thunder—without mixed vehicles. Information density high: each sentence advances memory, object, or setting. One scaffold paraphrase (“She had been trying to understand…”) is forgivable at 750 words. Clean copy, strong rhythm, no artifacts near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density: “weavers had encoded their secrets generations ago” carries exposition, stakes, and time depth in one clause. Varied sentence length propels decoding sequence; no scaffold loops. Metaphors (platinum labyrinth, silver needles) stay coherent and physical. Opening line anchors voice+concept; final line resolves via image. Minor near-repeat—“woven hush” named twice—but spaced enough to avoid paraphrase penalty. Proofing clean; no typos or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose shows lyrical control without purple overload: figurative language is patterned (echo variations) and paid off. High information density—each whisper line advances both plot and theme. No synonym loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“polyphonic,” “conceptual repricing”) stays within an artist-thinker lexicon, justified.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often delivers world rule, tactile detail, and ticking clock (“The workshop groaned…her lungs already burning”). Metaphors stay coherent—gears, star chart, jellyfish rigging—all acid-sea consistent. No filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops; final line is propulsive closure image, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; paragraph cuts are purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, emotion, or choice. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“cathedral of stone where water had carved pillars over millennia”) without purple accretion. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges the shell motif. Clean grammar, zero typos, high information density—every verb earns its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high—each polishing stroke doubles as meditation. One paraphrase loop (“its message lingered… waiting with open hands”) docks 0.2. No strained metaphors or register drift. Figurative language is spare, pattern-taught by grandmother’s lore, and pays off in the final pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is rhythmically alive: “the great antenna locked into place, pointing uselessly toward a constellation that no longer mattered” varies cadence and stakes in one breath. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language stays accurate—oxidation as calendar, jacket as atlas—without mixed-metaphor clutter. One minor filter verb cluster (“she felt it in her sternum”) keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Information density high; most sentences do double duty (e.g., “salt killed everything delicate” salts setting + stakes). One paraphrase loop: “no footprints… no wallet… no boat” lists absence without new pressure; minor. Metaphor vehicles coherent—opal, question mark, ghostly glow—no mixed logic. Read-aloud rhythm varied; no template cadence. Artifacts do not touch closure; within 9- tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense: “wild roses blooming impossibly in midsummer” packs anomaly + season + smell. Metaphors stay coherent (maps / paths / trails) without overload. No loops or synonym churn; sentences vary in length and opening. Register consistent—no academic drift. Opening line hooks; closing image of rising creek recharges motif. One tiny scaffold: “the letter was ‘P’—for promise, perhaps, or path” is authorial nudge, but brief and character-plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or interiority. Metaphors are coherent—starlight as wounds, grotto as mouth—without mixed-vehicle clutter. Information density high: “The ridge loomed ahead, its cobalt stone drinking the twilight” fuses setting, color, and agency in one stroke. Filter verbs minimal; perception rendered as action. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with imagistic punch. Micro-scaffold only: “She moved deeper” could be cut, but momentum is unimpeded. No artifact touches closure beat, satisfying 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear: varied sentence openings, no template cadence. Information-dense lines—“each chamber a precise measurement of growth, each curve a mathematical poem”—do triple duty (science, beauty, theme). Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. One micro-awkwardness: “density of presence” appears twice in adjacent clauses; flag −0.2 but does not touch closure. Metaphor coherence pristine: nautilus = cosmology = memory, never violated.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often performs scene-setting, backstory, and metaphoric re-weighting (“Tonight she reviewed her own dreams…”). Figurative language is patterned and paid off—soup, origami, thread—never stacked in pressure beats. No synonym churn or template cadence; openings vary. Minor scaffold: “edges curling like dried leaves” is familiar, but it is the only cliché and occurs early.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: copper ticks “against the silence like a drowning heartbeat” performs three jobs—sound, metaphor, foreshadowing. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding; each sentence advances image or choice. One mixed vehicle: “emotional terrain” followed by “twist of metal worn smooth” slightly muddles map/land with hand/tool, but the slip is outside peak closure beat. Otherwise, syntax breathes with pressure, and final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long sentence opens, fragments spike during vortex. No loops; “paper” recurs but each use shifts state (dusty → airborne → shelved). Metaphors are coherent—river ice mirrors frozen reputation—without clutter. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath. Final line is a taut cadence that re-prices “song” from metaphor to environmental fact.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence length breathes with spiral motion. Information density high—“manuscripts that documented civilizations that would exist, had existed, or existed only in probability’s shadow.” No loops or synonym churn; metaphors (“origami,” “black hole”) stay physically coherent. Occasional elevated register (“resounding hush,” “conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated. Final line is crisp, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“line so precise it could cut,” “hammered steel”—and never muddled. Information density high: one sentence often does setting, motion, and metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. The single passive (“time could be shepherded”) is voice-motivated. Closure image remains crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, high-density; no paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“glowed in waves like slow breaths” is the only simile, justified by bioluminescence. Sentence openings vary; paragraphs trim fat. One microscopic repeat: “quiet wildfire of understanding” appears twice; because the second is the resonant final line, the echo feels purposeful rather than scaffold. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences dual-task (e.g., “yellow light in a sea of grey June water” sets season, mood, isolation). One scaffold pair: “She’d just calculated…moved forward” restates prior beat. Figurative control strong except minor mixed vehicle (“melancholy felt alive, growing like clover through cracks in her certainty”)—organic but slightly over-cute. No artifacts near closure; momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “receiver sat wedged between water pipes and electrical conduits” performs spatial, occupational, and sonic setup in one stroke. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—fragments (“Her breath caught.”) replace longer sentences without drumbeat monotony. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Metaphor disciplined: “music that felt like memory itself” is single extended vehicle, not stacked clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is almost loop-free; one paraphrase overlap (“she would archive this too” echoes “she had spent seven years documenting”) but the repetition is purposeful callback, not scaffold. Sensory nouns are specific—jasmine, vinegar, sepia—not adjectival fluff. Metaphors stay coherent: jetty as finger, steeping as recognition. One clause drifts toward abstraction—“context would change everything”—but is anchored by the concrete locket beat immediately after.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—“disused railway station had become Mara’s headquarters not by design but by necessity” performs characterization, setting, and backstory in one stroke. Metaphors stay coherent (ivy as reclamation, rumors as travel) and do not stack during high-pressure beats. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Final clause “We heard a rumor” functions as rhythmic snap-close that echoes opening causality without scaffolding. Minor over-adjectiving (“desperately jocular bark,” “practiced anarchy”) is justified by voice and not repeated to clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with only minor scaffold: small echo of “different dates, different discoveries” could be trimmed. Figurative language is controlled, never clustering in high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop (“history flexed like a poem being edited” / “living in the space between drafts”) nudges overlap but serves cadence. Closure image is uncluttered, letting the inked pen scratch carry the weight; hence stays above 8.0 but shy of 8.5+ purity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences do double duty: “She raised it to her eye anyway, framing the luminous scene, capturing nothing but the memory of what once mattered” advances camera beat, stakes, and theme in one sweep. No mixed metaphors; moonlight-as-diamonds is single, coherent vehicle. Zero loops or scaffold; no synonym churn. Final line “Nothing captured. Everything preserved.” lands with epiphanic compression that recharges prior motifs. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the harbor swell.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “volcanic tenderness erupting in tears” compresses geologic and bodily force without purple drift. Sentence lengths modulate from spartan field-note to tidal cadence as pressure crests. Zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphor; “ochre pigments still vibrant after three thousand years” is specific, not catalog tourism. The final line’s spondaic punch—“Some promises… burn down your own life”—lands the ear-test climax.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: “silence pooled in shallow depressions like liquid shadow” does three jobs in ten words. Rhythm varies: long image sentences alternate with clipped drum beats. No synonym loops; “drumming” reappears purposefully as motif. One mixed-metor risk—“pocket dimension where cosmos pressed nearer”—but forgivable in speculative mode and does not tangle closure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: single sentences fold map lore, storm physics, and personal history (“He’d worked maintenance… electromagnetic pulses”). No scaffold; each paragraph advances choice or atmosphere. Metaphors are precise—”ribbons of poisonous green” couples beauty and threat; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm accelerates into the final door-click, then relaxes into the aurora coda. Zero paraphrase loops; “folded maps” recurs with shifting function, not repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, vivid, mostly dual-job: “weathered hands adjusting the wooden shutters” shows age and action. One scaffold: “she realized” appears twice in 50 words. Mixed metaphor risk—“bruised light” beside “stillwater tension”—but both sustain aquatic/evening palette, so coherence holds. No typo, no simultaneity error; paragraph cuts are crisp. Density high enough for short form; minor repetitions keep it shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences switch length to mirror reflective vs. persuasive beats. No synonym loops or template cadence; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid density penalty. One strained metaphor—“forests of second thoughts”—is forgiven because it is immediately contextualized via window displays. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested; final sentence lifts “cobalt library” from first paragraph to create resonant frame.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence lengths; information dense—“yellowed with age and etched with a map no cartographer would recognize” does three jobs. One mixed metaphor: “dawn painted the sublittoral fringe in shades of copper and pearl” slightly layers paint-on-water, but clarifies immediately. No scaffold loops or filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clean, varied, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“wood curls fell like tiny prayers” compresses grief and craft. One mixed moment: “renewable indifference” edges editorial, but fits Marcus’s ironic stance. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences do triple duty (e.g., “humming quartz colonnade stood waiting…” advances setting, stakes, and backstory). Figurative language is sparse, precise, never muddled. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the last. Minor scaffold: “boundaries once thought sacred” appears twice with slight rephrase (−0.2). Final line earns its lyric uplift without purple drift. Clean grammar and tense.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; most lines serve two jobs (advance + texture). Occasional elevated diction—“crystallized final moment,” “conceptual repricing”—leans academic, not color-blind artisan, but appears outside peak beats so penalty light. No loops, paraphrase stacks, or metaphor muddle. Strong ear: varying paragraph lengths create visual breaths that echo painting pauses.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density high—single sentences deliver spinal surgery backstory, lamp provenance, and emotional turn. No synonym loops; “sound” recurs but each time reweighted (artifact → data → shared bath). Metaphor vehicles stay coherent: prism-song / fractured light / golden shadows form one optic family. Minor scaffold: “the realization propelled her current project” could compress, but it occurs early and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: single sentences fold time (“Six months had passed…”) and layer metaphor (“stars…genuinely artificial in their own way”). No scaffold loops; each crane mention advances either geography or grief. Metaphors stay coherent—curtains, windows, bloom—without mixed vehicles. Final line achieves cadence release after controlled build.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and dense: “rain drummed… diamonds” opens with sensory compression; “quantifying relationships that existed before numbers had names” packs history into one clause. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language is selective, never more than one image per beat. Minor register drift in “Conceptual Repricing” is reflexive academic phrasing, but it lands outside peak beat, so penalty is waived. Final line recharges “endlessly recombining” with echo cadence, earning its lyric lift.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variety is high; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“atoms of nostalgia” is the only extended metaphor, introduced early and re-echoed at closure, so it reads as pattern, not purple. Information density is extreme: each sentence performs world-building, emotional intensification, and conceptual re-framing simultaneously. One microscopic scaffold: “feeling it warm and cool simultaneously” uses a stock dual sensation, but it is over in five words and does not recur.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is fluid, with high information density: single sentences deliver world-rule, sensory cue, and thematic echo. A few template cadences (“Every…every…every…”) are purposeful, listing sterilization, so they escape penalty. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops. The closing line’s cadence is satisfying, but the penultimate sentence’s “truth had weight, and weight created shadows…” edges toward maxim; trimmed one clause, the line would tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean and double-jobbing: “mist curled through the gaps in the wooden walls” sets both atmosphere and porous boundary between truth/academia. Figurative control avoids purple overload—only two metaphors across 750 words, both paid off. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are surgical.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances knowledge or image. High density: brass rail worn smooth in same line as emotional static. Metaphors are coherent—love as “golden and luminous,” later as “water breaking through a dam”—and never mixed. Read-aloud ear test passes: varied sentence lengths, opening subjects shift, paragraph cuts yield visible rhythm. No artifact appears in final third; closure image remains luminous and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, high density (“stardust pattern—for every atom…”), only minor scaffold (“she understood… she too had been calcifying”) and one mixed-metaphor ripple; no artifact touches closure, but stacked figurative sentences in the mid-section dull propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates between propulsive freight-train clauses and hush-soft hortative lines. Metaphors stay internally coherent—smoke clouds “learn,” flowers “harmonize in broken beauty.” No synonym loops or filler stacks; information density high. One near-mixed metaphor—“roots diving through multiple realities at once”—is permissible under lyric license and does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet musical; sentences advance both image and idea. One scaffold loop—“the forest was…”—appears twice in close succession (-0.2). A single mixed metaphor (“trail of gears he left behind” yet gears are found, not dropped) is minor; no artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “ticket punch grew warm” does triple duty—sensory, causality (next use), metaphor. Varied rhythm; paragraph cut test passed—each graph advances knowledge or emotional charge. Minor scaffold: “about the... about the...” confession list telescopes time but reads intentional as breathless spill. No mixed metaphors; no artifact in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences layer time, body, and metaphor (“Three months since the battle—three months of nerve regeneration, of pins and needles blossoming into crude sensation”). No loops or paraphrase; “snow that never stopped falling” is purposeful incantation, not synonym churn. Metaphors stay internally coherent (frozen fingers/clawing turrets). Grammar clean; pronouns unambiguous after subject shift to Silent-Choir. Final line offers resonant send-off without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: concrete nouns(“petrified lightning bolt,”“starlight-water”)replace modifiers; metaphors stay physically coherent. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each sentence adds new angle(ink→constellations, cathedral spire slow-topple). One mixed image:“cathedral spire topple in slow motion”is slightly incongruous for ancient temple, but it’s brief and doesn’t touch closure. Final line lands with satisfying sonic snap. High-band ear test passed.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence length; high density—single sentences splice data, memory, and sensory cue; no mixed metaphors or scaffold loops; minor filter verb cluster “she found herself doing” could be crisper; closing paragraph avoids explain-everything trap, ends on image.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density: one sentence often does setting + metaphor + interiority. One paraphrase loop noted above; otherwise no synonym churn or template cadence. Metaphors are precise: “thunderous serenity” is oxymoron that pays off in hum. No mixed metaphors at closure. Opening line anchors voice; final line crystallizes image. Proofing clean. Minor −0.2 for loop leaves room for 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty—world, body, myth—without scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, geothermal, and coherent: “amber grown rather than mined.” Rhythm modulates from meditative soak to single-beat release. Zero mixed metaphors, zero filter stacks. A lone intensifier—“immediately”—could be cut, the hairline slip that blocks 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density: “coaxed from stubborn soil” does world, character, and metaphor in five words. Varied sentence length breathes with panic crest/recall cycles. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge voice. Minor elevated note—“conceptual repricing,” “somatic markers”—reads as Mira’s acquired clinical lexicon, motivated, not register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density: most sentences advance image or pressure; scaffold minimal. Metaphor vehicles consistent—light=heartbeat, cards=keys—no mixed logic. Loops absent; no synonym churn or template cadence detected. One clause of slight register drift: “conceptual repricing” level of abstraction appears in interior thought, but remains in character lexicon of philosophical painter.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “wind had carved elaborate patterns into scattered sand” simultaneously anchors setting and foreshadows ink technique. No paraphrase loops; each descriptive stroke advances either map or mood. Metaphor density peaks only in the final cave spiral where it is justified by the concept. Proofing clean; pronoun chain never snags across Kael/drone/Vera triangulation. Final line—“both of them disappearing into the wind-carved landscape”—threads the diction back to opening, giving circular muscle without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “truths too dangerous… toppled governments” packs premise and stakes in one clause. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors are coherent—“library held its breath” mirrors suspended history—without crowding the override moment. Final line cadence slows to match the hush of snow and secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pace: winding openings for planting, staccato when Kael enters. Information density high—single sentence slips hydraulics, paternal trade, and emotional distance. One mixed metaphor (“wind rose to a tranquil blaze”) is forgiven because it fuses tone and weather. No loops, no scaffold; every paragraph advances knowledge, stakes, or image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is almost loop-free; only one soft paraphrase (“distance and departure” echoing “steel on steel”) repeats sentiment already implied. Sentence openings vary, propulsion stays high; each clause adds sensory or causal information. Metaphors obey the sound-world physics—no mixed vehicles—so garden logic stays intact. The density of figurative language is high but justified by the accumulative design; every image reappears reweighted in the final heartbeat, earning its page real estate.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “starlight bounced off copper instruments, creating whispers that multiplied into conversations with themselves” does three jobs in one line. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (telescope as creature waking). One near-mixed metaphor—“orbit of regret”—but accepted as character diction.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: “fossilized resin with a perfectly preserved wasp suspended inside, forever mid-flight toward some Cretaceous bloom” packs world-age, stakes, and metaphor in one breath. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses during firmware rewrite, then exhales into meteor hush. Metaphors are coherent: sound-crystal ≠ mixed vehicle. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong density—simultaneous world-building and interiority in single strokes: “limestone curved inward like cupped palms.” Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences for mist, staccato for chalk taps. One mixed metaphor—“unease turned sacred”—is minor, doesn’t cloud closure. No loops, no scaffold; final line is clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: a single sentence often slots place, history, sensory cue, and emotional valence (“ancient stones, her augmented fingers tracing chipped patterns of a mosaic stepping stone that had once adorned a minaret”). Metaphors are few but precise—sky “fractured like broken glass” sets tone without overcrowding later beats. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; paragraph cuts all earn their keep. A lone participle opener (“Forcing everyone to kneel…”) is sequential and coherent. Clean enough for 9 territory, held to 8.7 by one mixed image—“sky itself seeming to crack from the heat”—that momentarily anthropomorphizes atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often carries color, time-splice, and emotional charge: “apple trees heavy with fruit that bloomed and withered simultaneously.” Figurative layer disciplined—no mixed vehicles. Occasional adjective clusters (“midnight blue tasted like copper”) justified by synesthetic rule. Final crystalline chimes avoid overwriting, letting image carry closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes—long sentences for studio calm, shorter pulses at “There… tangle.” Information density high: “luminous trails that seemed to fold into themselves with impossible precision” does triple duty (visual, concept, foreshadowing). One near-loop: “fractally precise” appears twice within 60 words; minor. Clean grammar, vivid verbs, no scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density—single sentence often layers sensory data, historical context, emotional import. Metaphors (“grief pooled”) remain consistent to liquid cave imagery; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: tidal caesuras calmer, clause-rich surges during contact. Minor scaffold: repeated “she” opener in final paragraph; does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean and image-dense: “amber warehouse beneath the cliffs” anchors palette and scale in four words. Rhythm modulates—long, cadenced sentences for archival vastness, staccato “They might hold on, or let go with intention” for prophetic list. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors; “unscrambling history” is apt mechanical metaphor for button data. Final line cadence—“We continue”—earns its capitalized brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence can deliver weather, melt-rate, and emotional cue without padding. Rhythm breathes—long frost-images contract to staccato climb-down once clock starts. No mixed metaphors; snow as archive is sustained, not contradicted. Minor scaffold: “the valley… the valley” echo in adjacent lines (−0.2), but it does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with fog: lapping, ticking, slow percussion mirror tension; sentence variation natural. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Metaphors (fog thick as wool, punctuation-mark stars) are spare, patterned, paid off. Opening line anchors voice/stakes; final line resolves to image that recharges needle motif. High density: each sentence advances mood, clock, or insight. Pronoun, tense, spatial tracking clean.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory detail, metaphor, and causality (“Through it, she could see…”). Rhythm modulates—lyric elongation vs. stark frag-lines—supporting pressure. Figurative language is disciplined; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “she could see” clauses create micro-loop (−0.1). No artifacts in closure third; propulsion stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long moonlit sentences breathe, clipped horticultural verbs propel. Figurative control high—“papery lightness of ending” condenses grief and texture. One scaffold loop: “reflected moonlight” echoed thrice in 30 lines without new pressure. Otherwise dense, specific, clean; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Final mounting beat lands clear.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence can deliver sensory cue, memory shard, and stakes shift—“warm to the touch” books imply harvested souls and foreshadow her future. No mixed metaphors; crystal walls, tidal pressure, cloud ocean stay physically coherent. Scaffolding almost nil; only “she realized” once, forgiven at climax. Read-aloud rhythm varies without algorithmic pattern; paragraph breaks mirror breath units. Closing line is artifact-free and re-opens the image cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical without algorithmic pattern; sentence lengths vary from 4-word pulses to 28-word spiral sentences. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “flower’s throat,” “cupped palm holding silence.” Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Opening and closing lines twin through mirrored water imagery, recharging motif without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is supple; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“stone walls pressed closer,” “starlight filtered through cracks”—no mixed metaphors. Zero loops or synonym churn; each line advances knowledge or atmosphere. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line resolves by image that recharges compass motif.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong information density: single sentences carry double duty (“mist clung…like memory itself”). One paraphrase loop detected (“furrowed hush” echoed twice in closing paragraph) but serves cadence, not scaffold. Metaphor coherence high; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breaths with descent/ascent motion. Minor filter-verb cluster in interview summary is brief and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, high-density; figurative language is rationed to two vivid kernels—violet clouds twisting into impossible geometries, journals crackling like thin ice—each tied to Mira’s sensorium. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Sentence lengths vary; opening line anchors voice and stakes. A lone filter-verb stack (“seem to bend”) is justified by her measuring gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; sentences pull triple duty—advance plot, deepen atmosphere, texture character. Varied sentence cadence mirrors musical phrasing without falling into algorithmic pattern. Figurative language is sparse, high-impact (“morning light that seemed too bright, too crystalline”). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; occasional participle openers are sequential, not simultaneous. All clauses parse cleanly; no artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: declarative openings for routine, then enjambed clauses that mimic dusk settling. Information density is high—one sentence often does three jobs (setting, backstory, emotional state). No scaffold or synonym loops; “polished calm” appears once and is then shown. Metaphor is spare and coherent: “dusky harmony” returns in final line to re-charge opening. Minor filter verb (“he watched”) is voice-motivated ranger vigilance, not clutter. Copy-clean: no tense drift, pronoun clear after father/son subject switches.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Sentences layer jobs: "She pulled up her dream journals on the tablet, pages filled with symbols that matched the temple walls" shows action, backstory, and causality in one breath. Figurative language is spare and pattern-taught: star-pulses = heart-pulses. Final line—"everything changes, and nothing changes alone"—earns its aphoristic punch via accumulated specifics, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often does two jobs (“apple trees grew in impossible spirals…drinking black water”). No synonym loops; “spiral” recurs only when physical geometry tightens. Metaphors stay coherent—warlike serenity is blade/sheath, not mixed weapon sets. One micro-scaffold: “frozen confession, caught between speaking and silence” slightly paraphrases itself; too minor to dull cadence or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings varied. One paraphrase loop: “time to prepare, time to understand, time to find” could compress. Mixed metaphor risk—“bruised purples” beside “defiant, unnatural spirals”—remains coherent. No scaffold sentences; information density high. Filter verbs minimal; props tracked cleanly. Closure image fertile soil is crisp and recharging.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe. Mixed metaphors avoided: roots/bones/card form one coherent skeletal through-line. No looped stems or synonym churn. Filter verbs minimal; most perception is direct (“edges still warm”). One scaffold risk—“he’d been coming… who believed… who thought…” triple tag—but compression serves backstory economy without breaking propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density high: single sentence packs saw-mark dating, nail alloy, emotional tremor. Metaphors (“prayer flag for everything he’d lost”) are sparse, precise, non-contradictory. No scaffold; paragraph cut test passes—removing any graph erodes knowledge or charge. Minor filter verbs (“he began”) are voice-motivated and spaced.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high—single sentences layer gear mechanics, lunar phase, and emotional tint. Figurative language is selective: moon “three-quarters full, waxing toward completion” foreshadows the closure image without overwriting. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Line-level artifacts do not touch the final mobile image. Opening and closing lines are anchored and resonant, respectively.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is textured yet disciplined; figurative bursts (“architecture shimmered between states of being”) are sparse enough to avoid density penalty. One paraphrase loop: “cautious exuberance rising… tempered by the knowledge” restates same beat. Strong verbs (“clutched,”“pulsed,”“breathed”) outweigh nominalizations. Filter verbs minimal; no scaffold clutter. Final image earns its quiet cadence without syntactic monotony. One mixed metaphor (“cold fire”) is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: each sentence layers sensory, metaphoric, and plot work—no loops, no scaffold. Figurative risk is high but coherent (ice violin = memory machine); mixed-metaphor danger is skirted because the vehicle is literally see-through crystal. Minor overgrowth of adjectives in “velvet observatory smelled of honeysuckle and old starlight” but the excess is voice-motivated and cut before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm toggles between glacial melt and quicksilver tool flicks; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “emerald chip blazed like a tiny star” is earned, not piled. Information density high—each sentence layers temperature, color, emotional calculus. Minor scaffold: “She had...” past-perfect opens three sentences in 40 words; stays under −0.3 threshold and never touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: short beats for climb, longer cadences for listening. High information density—each sentence adds texture or knowledge. No mixed metaphors; “cloak of doubt” is extended, not dumped. One scaffold trace—“she’d built her reputation on certainty” / “profitable certainty” is purposeful echo, not loop.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective rather than overbearing. One scaffold loop: “through the patterns…” clause is repeated verbatim, dulling immediacy. No mixed metaphors; closure sentence is crisp and image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers world rule, sensory hit, and memory logic. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent—echoes as sediment, ravens as compass—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor cadence repetition (“had been,” “had stood”) is purposeful ancestral echo, not scaffold. Closure beat is clean of figurative muddle. Proofing clean: no typos, pronoun drift, or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: each sentence advances atmosphere or character state; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors—“magic flickered like a candle in a hurricane”—are singular, not stacked, and serve pressure. Opening and closing lines echo “icebound spire” and “accommodates impossibilities,” creating taught circular frame. Minor scaffold: repeated “automated systems” phrase three times; doesn’t obscure causality but caps 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “brass lighter, igniting each lamp as twilight deepened” does setting + action + mood in one sweep. Varied sentence rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors (lanterns as notes) stay coherent and pay off at closure. Zero filter-verb clusters; props tracked cleanly across underwater choreography. Final line cadence slows to match her “purposeful wandering,” giving musical rest without stall.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with escalation: descriptive cadence accelerates into white-out single-sentence climax. High information density—each sentence handles both world-collapse scale and tactile coin detail. Metaphors disciplined: “universe’s death rattle” stays physical via static shriek. One paraphrase loop on “wavelength align” costs −0.2. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines both anchor and recharge; paragraph cut test passes. Typos absent; grammar clean.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ear-test rhythm varies: long clause builds telescope imagery, then short punch (“She understood that impulse now”) delivers turn. Metaphors stay consistent—sea monsters = named dread—no mixed vehicles. One micro-loop: “She had come here seeking answers after discovering those recordings” repeats prior beat, but it advances knowledge and does not recur. High information density: each sentence layers atlas, recordings, light, or predecessor voice without padding.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm ripples: long sentences swell during forge-work, then fragment at the clang. Metaphors (“frozen river of light”) are sparse, taught early, and re-energized in the final mist. Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances bell, drip, or body state. Closure line avoids syntactic drumbeat, letting the shadow image breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean: “flashlight beam catching,” “concrete cold through his uniform”—each noun does double duty as tactile fact and emotional barometer.  No filter-verb stacks; metaphor is spare (“photograph in developing fluid”) and taught early, paid off at closure.  One template cadence—“The photographs led him…Then another”—mirrors breadcrumb logic, justified.  Final line breathes, no scaffolding; rhythm accelerates toward single-sentence chime.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud ear is musical: alliteration (“waterfall that refracted”) and internal rhyme (“globes…boughs”) pattern without drumbeat. Each sentence performs two jobs—worldbuild and interiorize: “apple trees here bore fruit in all seasons simultaneously” marries setting to theme. Zero paraphrase loops; no synonym churn. The only over-ornate cluster—“chaotic and perfectly ordered,” “structure and spontaneity, the rigid and the flowing”—is brief and thematic, not peak-beat clutter, so penalty stays minor.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: short bursts during radio beats, longer lyrical flows for arboreal vistas. Figurative language limited to two key images (lightning, silver sea) that reinforce stakes, avoiding purple overlay. Information density high: single sentences convey time, professional protocol, emotional cue. No synonym loops or template cadence. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt”) but occur in low-pressure lines; closure image untouched. Opening and final sentences carry sonic echo without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: one sentence often performs worldbuilding, backstory, and emotional stakes. No template cadence or synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent (“Timelines branched and merged like neural pathways”). Micro-scaffolding appears once (“Whole. / Not simple. / But vivified.”) but is purposeful cadence, not clutter. Final paragraph fragment serves Charged Poise rather than drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm alternates between meditative rolling sentences and crisp decisive fragments. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. High density: one line often delivers sensory, intellectual, and causal jobs (“She photographed the seed under her desk lamp, then searched her botanical database”). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and ear-tested. Minor paraphrase echo—“storm-born silence” appears twice; does not obscure closure but prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with blower surges; sentence variety controls tempo. High density: one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and metaphorical work. A few decorative stacks (“macerated a spider web, ancient and abandoned”) flirt with overdensity but align with grief magnification. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; metaphor stays acoustically consistent. Final paragraph abstracts into thesis-tinged territory but earns it through prior concrete sound imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    Varied sentence rhythm, strong verbs (“shattered into a thousand dreams”). One near-loop—“mist curled / mist rushed” offset by verb shift. Metaphors coherent: phosphorescence as boundary marker, frost as emotion. No scaffold; every paragraph advances either assimilation dread or pendant hunt. High density line: “interiorizing exteriors” compresses premise into three syllables without jargon bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; sentence lengths vary to match the slow-creep of alchemy then the sprint of vivification. No synonym churn—“crucibles cracked,” “beakers bore stains” uses repetition with purpose. Metaphors stay coherent: frost on corpse, spring shoots through winter ice, silver veins in charred oak—each extends the living/death fusion. Information density is high; every sentence advances setting, backstory, or stakes without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generally propulsive, but small loops repeat (“like a forgotten promise… like iron prayers”) and mixed metaphors jostle (“throat of darkness” + “iron prayers”); density is high yet a few adjective stacks dull peak beats. No artifacts touch the closure image, so stays above 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “starlight pooled in underground chambers” does three jobs (visual, tactile, mythic). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally. Figurative language is selective—one sustained hourglass-through-starlight metaphor—avoiding purple clutter. Minor stretch: “pattern collision” is sci-fi jargon, but the grotto teaches the concept before the phrase appears, preserving clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; only one scaffold loop (“the same unsettling calm…” repeated) and a single mixed metaphor (“married to birth healing”) touch the climax; otherwise rhythm accelerates with the weaving beats and ends on a resonant single-sentence paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: one sentence often delivers world fact, emotional state, and thematic hint (“metal holds shape despite pressure—this is edge geometry”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new angle on star-memory or pressure physics. Metaphor vehicles stay coherent—anchor as boundary talisman—and are sparing, never cluttering high-pressure beat. Clean grammar; pronoun “she” always refers to Carta despite alien presence. Final line anchors both image and cadence, satisfying the read-aloud ear test. Copy consistent: “Current-Through-Stones” hyphenated throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud ear: cadence breathes with scene temperature—ink-spill twilight sentences lengthen, then tighten at the crackle reveal. Figurative language is selective: “twilight poured…like spilled ink” is fresh; “edges like broken glass” is stock but rescued by context. No paraphrase loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or image. One register drift: “textbook” twice in four lines feels lecture-room amid lyric mist; a hair’s breadth over the line.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong information density: one sentence can deliver tide state + sensor spike + emotional jolt. Metaphors are restrained and consistent—network as neural tissue, facility as ribcage. One paraphrase loop (“the facility groaned—a crashing hush...”) costs −0.3; otherwise no scaffold. Sentence rhythm consciously mirrors pressure—short beats during ascent. No register drift; technical terms accurate. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by returning image of rising tide.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is spare, used only when image advances knowledge—“pearl half-buried in white” anchors dome visually. One paraphrase loop: “corrupted files blinking error messages” repeats concept in adjacent clauses (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; register stays within Mira’s scientific lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry dual duty—e.g., “Light fractured through its flaw, projecting shadows that danced across the bone towers” simultaneously advances image and acoustic cause. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Occasional poetic elevation (“infinite conversation”) is pattern-taught early and paid off, so exempt from register drift penalty. One clause of simultaneity (“quietly articulate in a tongue no ear could hear”) is justified by internal paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong rhythmic control: varying sentence length mirrors musical swell. Dense doubling—e.g., “uprooting…literally and figuratively”—works because it is brief and thematic. No loops or mixed metaphors; verbs stay muscular (“crumbled,” “shuddered”). One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to slow”) is forgivable in speculative mode. Proofing clean; opening and closing lines ear-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes—long anacrustic sentences for dawn calm, clipped fragments at solder sparks. Metaphors are spare and coherent (brass “sings,” light “dances”); no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often layers tool, body, and light. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Copy is clean; only nit—a stray “its” that could tighten—but closure image stays luminous and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm breathes with the scene: longer, shelf-listing sentences for browsing quiet, then shorter clauses as air thickens. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new texture (paint-stained fingers, meteorological haiku). Metaphors are coherent—“pooled like water in hyperbolic curves” keeps liquid geometry consistent. Opening line anchors voice and concept simultaneously; final line resolves with image, not explanation. Only micro-slip: “the place where stories lived existed in the curved spaces” repeats “lived/existed,” but cadence is intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm modulates with scene temperature—long clauses for fog, clipped for dawn races. Two paraphrase loops (“she understood…” used twice) and one stock intensifier (“impossible archive”) dull final momentum slightly, but metaphor logic stays coherent; no artifact touches the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally clean, but two paraphrase loops (“impossible geometry… angles defying architectural logic”) and a stock metaphor string (“dark water… constellations that didn’t match”) slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clean of loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught—“woven between worlds” is repaid by later “threading connections.” No mixed metaphors; waterfall hush ↔ veil-thinning remain acoustically aligned. Occasional elevated phrasing (“succor from the encroaching gray”) is voice-motivated within lyric mode and does not recur mechanically. Final paragraph cadence slows to match dawn spread, providing resonant closure without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentences are clean, varied, propel without scaffold; no synonym loops or template cadence. Occasional elevated phrases (“accumulated silence the way old churches accumulated prayers”) flirt with overwriting but are earned by accumulative lens. Information density is high—each line advances ritual or backstory. Minimal metaphors, no mixed vehicles; clarity intact at closure. A few adjectival cushions (“enormous net,” “crystalline stone”) could trim, but none stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops, high density: each sentence advances map, weather, or interiority. Metaphors are spare and coherent—vault as chapel, silence as language, crack as question-mark—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes: long clause for rain-drumming, single-word beat for discovery. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-ignite motif without flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Varied sentence rhythms mimic drift vs. sudden catch of light; paragraphs shrink as decisions near. Figurative language is selective and purposeful, no mixed metaphors.

Information density high; each line advances character or atmosphere. No loops or artifactual synonym churn; proofing is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud cadence varies: opening spondaic crack of lightning, closing iambs of ballad. Sentences multitask: “She painted graffiti across the courtyard’s ancient stones, but her murals were more than decoration” advances action, world, and concept. No mixed metaphors; cloud-condensation pigment obeys internal logic. Minor scaffold: “unspoken needs” echoed three times—functional under Accumulative lens. No artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences carry dual duty: “elevator groaned… world dropped away” advances motion + stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are sparse, clean: “clockwork” servants.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm alternates between long textured sentences that mimic coin-circles and staccato fragments for brush-flicks. No scaffold; every paragraph advances either paint-layer, time, or interior realization. One near-loop: “she had learned…she had built” is purposeful anaphora, not redundancy. Closing sentence—“still unable to recognize the face she’d rendered so perfectly”—delivers the repricing without poetic inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythmic control is exemplary: ice / reflected ice / reflected ice mirrors the infinite recession without syntactic monotony. Information density high—one sentence often delivers tool-action, sensory data, and metaphor (“rust furred their edges like orange moss”). One micro-loop: “the rhythm of repair, not just the mechanical sequence but the deeper music beneath it” restates the same idea twice; costs −0.2. Otherwise zero scaffold, no mixed metaphors, strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks, strong verb/noun pairings (“gnarled fruit trees sprawled,” “serpentine shadows,” “brambled hope”). Figurative language is spare and precise—one metaphor per beat, never stacked. Rhythm breathes with pressure: short sentences for dawn Manifestation, longer drifting cadences for twilight fades. No misplaced modifiers or tense slips; “ectoplasmic fingers” is exact neologism that stays within POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm flexes with scene temperature; metaphor density is high but taught early and paid off (“sandpaper the rough memories” returns as literal method). No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. “Bitter almonds, spoiled milk, metallic tang” packs three senses in four words. Occasional elevated diction (“ten thousand years”) fits mythic frame; not unmotivated. Final tear is unadorned, letting cadence settle cleanly.

    Sentences vary from fluid aerial sweeps to staccato corrections, propelling momentum. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor (silver threads, chandeliers) earned at a high-stakes beat. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every clause adds new visual or tactile data. One mixed moment—“world turned inside out” beside “down became up”—is redundant; trimming either phrase would clear 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors wind: short gusts (“She moved. Documented. Adapted.”) against longer accumulation clauses. High density—each line carries sensor data, spatial note, or memory cue—without purple overload. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stake cleanly, achieving propulsion that serves the conceptual repricing ending.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)

Figurative language is selective: “puddled robes,” “geometric proofs of beauty,” each image tied to POV bias. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. One paraphrase loop across adjacent lines is absent; occasional “the pendant… the pendant” reprises are purposeful re-anchors, not artifacts. Final line “already calling” is crisp and propulsive.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “relic that turns carrier into pollinator” is a fresh inversion of the standard MacGuffin quest. The memory-to-myth fade of mentors is handled as lived cosmology rather than meta-commentary. Specific details—dragonfly-wing membrane, willow-bone flute, story-seeds carved with spirals—feel particular to this world. Risk is taken in quiet lyric accumulation rather than twist; coherence holds. Transformation test fails: swapping pendant for generic gem would collapse the vibration mechanic, confirming originality.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length; clause rhythm mimics light-splitting. No template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is restrained—frost “words,” “small hand reaching”—and stays within physical logic. Opening and final lines bracket with arboreal resonance; no scaffold or overwriting touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density: “Each pass of the shuttle carried her intention” does three jobs in nine words. One paraphrase loop—“she caught fragments: her name, a question, sometimes just the sound of breathing”—slips into list cadence, a minor artifact. No metaphor muddle; figuratives are spare and apt. Enough control for 8.2, but the late list keeps it beneath 8.5.

Clean grammar, precise verb choice (“thread,” “swell,” “foreclose”) and zero paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances map, memory, or fold. Figurative density is high but patterned—every metaphor is sensory (flowers, translucent pages) and paid off. No mixed metaphors; “collapsed stars” is the only near-strain but is saved by its placement in Mira’s voice-over, not Kael’s embodied perception. Final line is a monosyllabic brake that earns its cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: each sentence layers action, tool, and metaphysics. No scaffold loops; mixed metaphors absent. One overwritten patch—"patterns that sailors once mistook for omens" followed immediately by "refracting starlight into patterns"—repeats "pattern" without new angle, a minor paraphrase. Otherwise precision shines ("copper filaments that predated electricity"). Closure image is crisp, uncluttered. Final third clean, so 9+ not disallowed.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “sapphire and turquoise and colors that had no names” packs sensory data without modifier overload. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated phrasing (“iridescent caution,” “valley-mist wonder”) stays justified by lyric mode taught early. One hairline slip: “quietly explosive beauty” edges toward oxymoron cliché, but the pattern absorbs it.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, scaffold-free; no paraphrase loops, no synonym churn around “tree,” “dream,” “moonlight.” Figurative layers serve concept: “amber resin” marries organic and emotional without mixed-metaphor clash. Information density high—each sentence layers task, world-rule, or image. One micro-loop: “maintenance… maintain” in closing line; too slight to deduct more. Closure image clear, uncluttered. Achieves 9-band cleanliness except for that echo, holding at 8.6.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence variety is strong; no template cadence or synonym loops. Occasional elevated phrasing—“accumulated hope of thousands, braided together”—is earned by lyric register. Mixed metaphors are avoided; aurora ribbons extend prior light imagery. One minor scaffold: “she would attempt the weaving” announces rather than enacts intention, but it is early and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Sentences carry double duty: “present but elsewhere” compresses status and psychology.

Density high without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each image advances either atmosphere or causality. Figurative language is spare and precise—“vines claiming marble columns like patient conquerors” grounds the political in the botanical.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean, varied, high-density: each sentence advances cataloguing process or atmospheric pressure. Figurative layer is restrained—no metaphor pile-ups in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: one sentence can set status, sensory cue, and foreshadow (e.g., “documents that would remake identities by morning”). No filter-verb clusters; verbs like “coiled,” “pressed,” “lapped” energize beats. Metaphors stay within maritime economy—no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud cadence accelerates into playback climax, then exhales into final line; no template cadence or synonym loops. Only hairline slip: “comforting unease” reused verbatim, but its recurrence is motivated thematic echo, not accident.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry double duty—sense data plus metaphor—without clogging beats. No template cadence or synonym loops. One mixed metaphor (“clouds gathered like curious children”) is minor. Aurora/lavender/taste motifs recur with shifting valence, avoiding static repetition. Closure line—“the future tasted like home”—is concise, propulsive, and recharges earlier taste motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “quartz formations caught what little light remained, throwing auroral sorrow” does double atmospheric and emotional work. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay physically coherent—hair into wings, flowers from nurse’s hair—no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence openings mix prepositional, participial, and subject-first structures. Information density high—single sentences deliver map function, grandmother hint, and bodily response. No mixed metaphors; "crystalline domes," "spoiled-milk sky," and "gilded-leaf calligrapher" stay within coherent visual field. Minor filter verb in "she felt herself growing smaller" but immediately embodied by physical wilt; no loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors avoided—“pale ocean” is single, sustained. Sentence variety supports wind-gust pacing. One near-purple phrase (“symphonies of truth”) is earned by prior calibration talk. Final paragraph contains no figurative muddle; tactile image carries closure. Minor: “infinitesimal droplets” could trim to “beads,” but density remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong rhythm control: long breathless sentences for memory cascades, then short declaratives after burial. One scaffold loop—“strangely organic… fragmented wholeness” repeated close—dulls momentum slightly; otherwise density is high and no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, image-driven, almost no scaffold; information often doubled (e.g.,“tangled bougainvillea and worn brick arches” does one job). One paraphrase loop: “listening—truly listening—could mend.” Metaphors stay coherent (sandstorm calm, photograph in developing fluid). Mailbox key turn is cleanly sequential; no simultaneity errors. Final line earns cadence echo.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or action without scaffold. Metaphors (terrestrially cosmic, tranquil blaze) are repeated but patterned early and payoff at closure, avoiding mere loop. One near-loop: “like a blessing, like a lullaby, like the softest answer” triples simile, but cadence serves the spell-release beat and does not obscure causality. Otherwise, clauses are varied, concrete, and information-dense.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level propulsion is high; opening line grounds stakes (“meteor shower painted silver streaks”) and each paragraph advances either knowledge or image. No paraphrase loops; information is duplex—tea pour signals hospitality and time passage. Metaphors stay architecturally coherent (inscriptions as promises, meteors as punctuation). One register spike—“Conceptual Repricing” diction—but justified by Elena’s academic self-defense. No typographical, tense, or pronoun flaws. Final image re-uses “stone” and “language” without mechanical repetition, achieving resonance rather than redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “experiences too dangerous to keep whole, split and planted” performs its own fracturing. One paraphrase loop—“tragically radiant” repeated twice—slips by without dulling momentum. Metaphors stay coherent (garden as archive) and physically grounded.

Final line lands with monosyllabic punch that recharges prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense: every paragraph advances either evidence or atmosphere. Metaphors are spare (“poisoned snow”) and mixed only once (“kernel of truth buried in baroque fabrications”) without logical clash. No loops, synonym churn or filler beats. Opening line anchors voice and premise; final line crystallizes choice. Copy is clean; minor opportunity: replace the cliché “pulse quickened” with a visceral alternative to hit full 9-band terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyric patterning is dense—figurative language appears in 70-80 % of sentences—but the storm-electric motif teaches its own repetition and pays off in the final cobalt flash. One mixed metaphor risk: “barnacle made of stone and glass” is novel yet slightly anatomically confused.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “she’d spent months learning to repair… trading poems for lessons” compresses time without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clarity and density are high: “lantern’s brass surface had corroded green” fuses visual, material, and historical data in one clause. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for chamber discovery, staccato for radio exchange. No mixed metaphors or looped paraphrase. Proofing clean; punctuation precise. Final sentence achieves lyrical lift without purple: “Some paths, she thought, get walked more than once.”

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pace—longer sentences during reflection, clipped fragments at the reveal. No filler-verb stacks; “felt something crack in her chest” is embodied, not diagnostic.

Sentences do double duty—“Their roots somehow finding purchase in the rocky soil between sea and sky” seeds both setting and metaphor for later choice. Metaphors stay within optical/ice physics: scattering, refraction, bloom—no mixed vehicles. The final line’s “scattering it toward the sea” re-uses the title image without repetition, achieving cadence closure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose shows high information density: single sentences layer time (bus gone, fog present, dawn pending), place, and metaphor. Figurative language is selective—no mixed-metaphor clutter even at beat peaks. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences alternate with crisp observations to control breathing. One paraphrase loop around “failure/destiny” repeats thematic terms twice within four lines, a hairline drag that caps the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught early (“spaces that appeared between thoughts”) and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is loop-free, scaffold-free; each sentence either advances setting, memory trigger, or polishing action. Mixed-metaphor risk in “frozen river” grotto is saved by sustained water/ice imagery that coheres. Information density high—one line can place glass, reveal tool source, and foreshadow child audience. Final line “little girl smiled at colored light” acts as charged callback, re-energizing “colored shadows” motif without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose breathes with variable rhythm: long, colon-laden sentences mirror cathedral hush; short beats (“Tears came”) punch through restraint. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors; “green cathedral” extends logically to “scripture” and “graft.” Information density high: single sentence delivers time elapsed, viral scope, emotional fallout. No loops, scaffolds, or filler verbs dull the final image; “two witnesses learning to dream awake” ends on clean, propulsive noun-phrase cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet airy: “mist rolled in from the sea like breath against glass” does triple sensory work. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or insight. Metaphors stay coherent (current, spiral, breath) and culminate in the closure image. One tiny scaffold—“she had learned to be lucidly watchful”—could compress, but it occupies low-pressure space and does not dull the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “the gathering hush…pressed against his ears like velvet” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. One mixed metaphor—“music as architecture”—is permitted at lyric peak without obscuring closure. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    High density: “photons that traveled eons…bound in cellulose and silver” compresses cosmology into craft. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Metaphors remain coherent (starlight = memory = map) and physically consistent. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: anaphoric “where their roots dreamed…where their branches remembered” gives ceremonial cadence that justifies repetition. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythmic control is excellent: long sentences for lull, staccato “ticked. Clicked. Began.” for climax. Information density high—one sentence often layers motive, sensory detail, and world rule (“Using scraps…teaching himself the language of springs”). No loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is spare (“reflections bloomed like flowers”) and immediately grounded in physical logic. Minor scaffolding in repeated “he saw” anaphora during echo roll-call, but it serves ceremonial cadence rather than clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense but legible; most sentences carry double duty (e.g., “Fatigue hardened into amber-colored crystal, beautiful and terrible”). One paraphrase loop appears—“silence layering over silence”—but it serves the shingle motif and is allowed. Mixed metaphors are avoided; crystallization logic stays physically coherent. Final line delivers a crisp, image-based payoff that re-illuminates earlier starlight shafts without rhetorical overhang.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rain drummed constantly… each droplet a small lens” does double sensory work. No synonym loops, no scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“aquarium of gray light”—but it’s brief and doesn’t taint closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “water spiral upward in defiance of gravity” does triple duty (image, rule, mood). One paraphrase loop (“moving and frozen”) is forgiven because it names the paradox the ending resolves. No mixed metaphors; lagoon physics stays coherent. The drop of the wheel replaces exposition with tactile punctuation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty—description seeds future action (“mineral deposits… refracting light” becomes the art-installation plan). Metaphors are sparse, consistent, and physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. One minor loop: “maze of intentions” appears twice with identical phrasing; a micro-rephrase would tighten. Otherwise clean, propulsive, and free of scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Density is high: “petrichor nostalgia” and “amber threads of dawn” each carry double duty (smell + time, color + light). No paraphrase loops; every sentence advances stance or image. Metaphors stay coherent—crystals as music box is extended, not contradicted. Final clause “toward everything she had finally decided to become” is slightly elevated diction for a formerly timid technician, a hairline register drift that keeps the category from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density—“sundial counterclockwise” ripples water, reveals diagrams, reweights premise in one line. Occasional elevated diction (“epistemic,” “conceptual”) fits scholar-quester but edges toward register drift; no mixed metaphors or loops. Final sentence breathes with elegaic parallelism.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level propulsion is relentless: every clause either advances tactile discovery or thickens atmospheric pressure. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; even “oceanic hush” is re-earned by fog’s acoustic flattening. Information density peaks when three artifacts are revealed in a single sentence triad, each noun doing double duty as clue and emotional increment. Final line cadence—white silence / rope / knots—creates a drumless heartbeat that seals the lyric architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean: every sentence advances image, pressure, or theme; no filler intros or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“hues that predated the Great Mechanization”—and avoids purple clusters. One paraphrase loop (“never truly wild, never completely alive”) is allowed because it serves the thematic hinge. Strong rhythm control: the final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the phoenix’s wing-spread, propelling to the resonant last line.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses setting, metaphor, and emotional state (“obsidian forms when fire and water meet so violently they create something beautiful”). No synonym loops; each sand image adds new physical or symbolic angle. Metaphors stay coherent—volcanic glass, reverse stars, suspended pain—without purple inflation. Final line cadence mirrors opening’s descent, creating circular propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence lengths vary, no template cadence. Metaphors (memories like released birds, city holding breath) stay coherent and non-contradictory. Information-dense lines do double duty: “lantern that cast more questions than light” reveals character and stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Only micro-slip: “like relief itself given voice” edges toward abstraction, but occurs at closure where poetic license is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are coherent (“echoes in a canyon”) and serve theme. No scaffold loops; sentences vary in length and syntax. One mixed metaphor mild: “sonar pinging through cosmic medium” stretches physics but acceptable in lyric frame. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested and cadence-matched, recharging the gear image.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Alien gardener who rescues generational castaways via nebula-flowers is fresh synthesis; trope of cosmic benefactor is reweighted by the keeper’s own immortality-as-burden. Brass gear as anti-talisman of failed metrics is a specific, memorable object. Risky lyric mode commits fully and pays off in final reprise. Could edge higher if the human pair felt less generic, but the conceptual angle is non-obvious.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers grief architecture or color filtration. No synonym loops; “migration” and “monarch” recur with accrued meaning. Metaphors stay coherent (glass/copper/tomato vines form one palette). Final line acts as both cadence and thesis without over-explanation. Minor filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    Figurative language is patterned rather than piled: the tower as “calcified finger” and guilt as “heavy brass sphere” return in charged closure. No mixed metaphors; each vehicle extends the horological lexicon. High information density—one sentence layers tidal retreat, social dependency, and her ethical burden. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “she carved” openers in mid-section, but rhythm recovers before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.1)
    Most sentences carry double duty (image + causality: “peeling in spirals that reminded her…”). Sparse filter verbs, no scaffold loops. One mixed metaphor—“finger pressed to cosmic lips” beside “drooping confession”—barely tolerable but reads intentional. Opening and closing lines anchor and echo without template cadence. Minimal modifiers favor concrete nouns (“cobalt silo,” “marigolds”). Proofing clean; zero artifact interference at closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: “obsidian spire rose from the frozen lake like a blade of volcanic glass” does world, metaphor, and stakes in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or cause. Rhythm breathes—long reflective sentences ascend the staircase, clipped clauses appear during ink-dip moment. Metaphors stay coherent (glass/blade/light) and do not collide. Minor filter verbs appear (“she noticed”) but are voice-motivated, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean and musical; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) without metaphor pile-up. One scaffold loop—“dust dancing luminous around her head” echoes prior “dust particles suspended”—but it occurs post-closure and does not dull the final image. Read-aloud rhythm is controlled and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose carries dense metaphor yet each image advances story: “architecture surrendered to fog” fuses setting + theme in one stroke. No synonym loops; “ash” recurs but each time re-weights meaning (sketches → message → faith). Varied sentence rhythm; paragraph cuts land on conceptual hinges. Momentary purple risk in “components of faith itself” is justified by Elena’s vocation and caps the accrual without muddling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm breathes—short ingress/egress beats around longer reflective paragraphs. Information multitasks: the cog’s origin line simultaneously reveals Marcus’s nightly ritual, his worldview, and the story’s central metaphor. No scaffold loops; “truth survives argument” is repeated once and earns its stature as closing cadence. Opening line anchors time and submerged premise; final line resolves by image (“evidence would wait”) that echoes the sediment motif.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentences vary in length and opening; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layer is dense (“illuminated manuscripts,” “braid diverse voices”) yet thematically coherent; only minor register creep (“conceptual repricing”) keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose fluid, mostly free of scaffold; “silver line across the sky,” “warm with stored starlight” verge on postcard but remain readable. Some conceptual overlap: “gentle rebellion” / “quietly taking root” echo without fresh inflection. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats. Clean copy, good information density, minor reliance on lyrical generics keep it mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; only one soft paraphrase loop (“drones…they…they”) appears mid-scene. Metaphors (nectar dusk, copper coils) remain coherent and value-adding. No register drift or filter-verb stack; high information density advances every sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. “The bay held its breath” is an earned metaphor that pays off literally when the hush falls. Information density high: “bottle caps, smoothed glass, a waterlogged paperback” compresses consumer flotsam and human stories into one line. No mixed metaphors; “shard of hush” extends the glass-shard motif without violating physical logic. Read-aloud rhythm in final paragraph—three anaphoric “through” clauses—creates processional closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is taut: ‘the statue’s thoughts hadn’t come as words but as layered memories’ compresses exposition into sensation. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors—‘comfortable lie,’ ‘structural weaknesses in her certainty’—are sparse, precise, and paid off by the literal cracked foundation. Final line ‘carrying cascading revelations toward the light’ recharges ‘cascade’ from the telepathic intro, earning its echo.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose breathes: paragraph lengths vary, openings rotate. High density—“equations balanced perfectly on paper, a symphony of variables that danced”—does multiple jobs. One scaffold loop: “without destination, without rest, without decay” triplet could compress. No mixed metaphors, no artifacts in closure beat. Rhythm accelerates into fall, slows into office wake-up, matching emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean and multi-tasking: “bread shaped like initials—a way of saying ‘you exist’” simultaneously world-builds, characterizes, and advances stakes. Metaphors are coherent—ice as museum vitrine, lens as curatorial filter—without mixed-vehicle clutter. One paraphrase loop appears (“displaced persons carried their identities in customs and crafts”) but recovers momentum immediately. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence obscure the final image; the emerald glow on cracked ice lands clean, earning high-band clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “latent radiance,” “four-dimensional knots,” “membrane between what was and what could be” all advance concept or stakes. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new causal or sensory layer. Mixed metaphors avoided—light as drain, tide as breath maintain internal logic. Final paragraph cadence slows to match the yoyo’s stop, giving closure rhythmic punctuation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentences vary in length and opening. Information density good—every paragraph advances image or knowledge. One scaffold hiccup: “the opera cloak clasp growing warm…its lingering luminance brightening in her mind until it seemed to pulse” compresses two clauses on same idea. No mixed metaphor; grammar clean. Minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to”) but not in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The wire continued down through the driftwood platform, trailing into the depths where the leeward currents whispered their secrets” paints scene, anchors tech, and foreshadows data conduit. Metaphors stay coherent—cloud fist, howling mouth—without mixed stacks. One scaffold moment: “twenty-seven families, three generations” is expository list, but it compresses context before the first chord and does not recur. Read-aloud rhythm rises to a crescendo matching the orchard’s hum, then falls to the final silence—effective cadence mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers shell lore, civic denial, and Maren’s bodily action. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“light that convinced everyone they saw all there was to see.” No loops or scaffold; the single paraphrase-like clause above is intentional thematic echo, not churn. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Propulsion remains steady; paragraph cuts are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences carry dual duty (action + atmosphere). Occasional gentle uplift—“spiraling down through dusty sunlight”—but no metaphor pile-ups. One scaffold trace: “noble lie, a beautiful fiction designed to unite” is immediate gloss; could compress. Punctuation and tense clean; no loops or synonym churn. Final line cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: one sentence often performs atmosphere, characterization, and causal cue (“He folded the note precisely and worked it deep into the foundation crack, sealing it with marine epoxy”). Metaphors are coherent—water as time, ink as memory—no mixed vehicles. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new information or tactile motion. A single scaffold phrase—“twice daily after the distant drawbridge rose for phantom ships”—could trim two words, but it does not stall the final image’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, mostly rhythmic, high density; a few template stems (“she… then she…”) appear but do not cluster at climax. Mixed metaphors avoided; “dappled resolve” is the only ornamental phrase, yet it is motif-earned. No loops or synonym churn; paragraphs advance knowledge. Closure line is crisp, unburdened by overwriting, sustaining momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, no scaffold, high density: one sentence often delivers world rule, emotional state, and physical action (“She folded each recorded dream into paper cranes, the gems embedded in their hearts, then released them…”). Metaphors stay coherent to light and folding; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm accelerates during folding, slows on release, matching breath of task. Opening and closing lines are mirror-bookends of craft, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and concept without scaffold. Metaphors are mixed but coherent—aurora as burning veil, geode as future coffin—supporting the accumulative design. No loops or synonym churn; “bleak exhilaration” is repeated once, intentionally. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the refusal to land, recharging “drift” as moral stance.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, high-density; metaphors are controlled (“circuit pathways etched…like constellations”) and paid off. No synonym loops or template cadence. Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing lines carry punch. One small scaffold: “But this one had been modified…” adds little new data. Otherwise clean, propulsive, read-aloud ready.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences open with varied syntactic shapes. Only one paraphrase loop detected (“weight of unspoken words” echoed two sentences later) but it is brief. Metaphors stay coherent—driftwood as broken promises, watch hand as stopped time—without purple strain. Final paragraph breathes correctly after high-pressure beat. No typos or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense without purple drift; sentences vary, no template cadence. Figurative choices (“stone ribbon fraying,” “furrowed hush”) are fresh yet coherent. One paraphrase loop—“mist swirled / mist rolled” in adjacent sentences—dings slightly. No scaffold, no synonym churn in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, no template cadence. Information-dense: one sentence can set scene, reveal backstory, and foreshadow (“She hadn’t known then how prophetic that melancholy was”). Metaphors stay coherent (no mixed vehicles). Minor scaffold: “three years since…” anaphora thrice; because it frames grief, reads as pattern not clutter. No loops or paraphrase in final third; closure beat sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single clause “procedure stripped… worth forgetting” layers backstory + emotional stakes. Figurative control: “delicately robust” risks contradiction but recovers by pairing fragile algae on stone—image is physically accurate. No loops; sentence stems varied; paragraph cuts are crisp. One strained phrase: “jaded wonder” could feel oxymoronic, yet context justifies it by payoff. Closure line carries perfect cadence: short declarative after lyrical build.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyric; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors are concrete and internally consistent—“voice layered with harmonics that belonged to creatures with too many throats” is exact and terrifying. A single mixed micro-image: “cinnamon that burned cold” is saved by immediate tactile payoff in the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is almost loop-free; only minor scaffold (“She...She...She” triad) is purposeful echo. Rhythm breathes with scene: long clauses for ascent, staccato repetends for promise. Metaphors are coherent—moonlight as spilled mercury, time calcified into ghost-objects—and never mixed. High information density: one sentence can anchor generation, guilt, and tool use. No artifact obscures closure; final tracing lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong verbs (‘grazing’, ‘blazed’, ‘prepared to be transformed’) and selective sensory detail keep momentum; only minor filter-verb clusters (‘she could feel’) and one mixed metaphor (‘pain...pooled like water behind a dam’) short of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: single sentences layer warmth, geology, and emotional history (“each grain still warm from the volcano’s perpetual heat”). Metaphors are coherent—black sand as compressed time, lightning as portable stars—and never mixed. Zero loops or scaffold; no paraphrase redundancy. Final line (“direction…simply the texture of existence itself”) lands with conceptual punch yet stays concrete through sand image.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Metaphors are coherent—“glided like silk” fits frictionless physics. No register drift; diction stays coastal-lyric, never academic. Final line cadence mirrors spiral completion, propelling exit breath.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “censored poet learns to read silence the way sailors read stars” compresses backstory and metaphor in one stroke. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for cloud vistas, staccato fragments during lightning flashes. No synonym churn; “vigil,” “timer,” “archive” recur with purpose. One mixed metaphor: “cartography of scars” is abstract but rescued by concrete map/landmark extensions. Closure line crisp: “keeping vigil over the spaces between what was said and what was true.”

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary length and opening; high-density lines (“glass atrium caught the afternoon light in fractured beams”) advance image and theme simultaneously. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent—geometric shadows, brook’s eternal question—without purple overload. Final paragraph’s “cathedral of questions” offers crisp, earned lyric lift.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty: “moon cleared the skyline, bright and merciless” paints scene and foreshadows cost. No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Metaphors stay coherent—sardine-can roof, liquid-silver light—without mixed vehicles. Filter verbs minimal; perception rendered direct: “hands move differently.” Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges motif of unrecognizable futures. One scaffold trace: “someone had scattered wildflower seeds…” could compress, but occurs early enough not to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Near-zero scaffolding: every sentence performs at least two jobs (e.g., “She played wistfully each evening in the tidal arbor terminal, suspended above clouds that rolled like ocean waves beneath the glass floor” sets scene, stakes, metaphor, and tone). Rhythm modulates like sheet music—crescendoing polysyndeton during cloud churn, clipped dashes during splice. Figurative logic stays coherent: compasses triangulate memory, not magnetic poles; mixed metaphor is avoided. One hairline filter verb cluster (“She realized…”) mid-climax costs −0.1; otherwise propulsion is immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: “seed…weight like a tiny sun” compresses metaphor and tactility in one stroke. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances. One mixed metaphor—“luminous doubt”—is sanctioned by thematic necessity and taught early. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif effectively. Minor over-adjectiving in flower description is offset by sensory purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is almost loop-free; only two adjacent near-paraphrases (“salt and renewal” / “smelled of salt and renewal”) cost −0.2. Figurative language is sparse and coherent; no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm consciously echoes wave and snip, accelerating slightly at the pruning beats without-template cadence. Copy is clean; information density high—each paragraph advances knowledge or atmosphere. Artifacts do not touch the closing horizon image, so 9-band remains reachable.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with near-perfect information efficiency: “dust from butterfly wings, iridescent scales catching the gray morning light like microscopic mirrors” establishes image, mood, and motif in one breath. Sentence openings vary organically; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—every line advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (light/dust/stars motif) and never muddled; even elevated diction (“kindled humility”) stays within Helena’s plausible lexicon. Final line resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “The canyon held its breath under a tapestry of stars” opens with voice and stakes.

Sentence variety supports rhythm; no syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line yield: “grief radiated in deep purples” conveys emotion, method, and visual simultaneously. Sentence openings vary (“Inside, Mara…” / “The conservatory had become…” / “Professor Chen found her…”), avoiding template cadence. Figurative language is coherent—music as landscape, silence as symphony—and never muddles causality. One minor slip: “phantom thunder in her skull” slightly contradicts later “could no longer hear anything,” but the poetic license serves thematic resonance without breaking closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Syntax varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching descent/ascent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise (“constellation of sharp-edged fragments,” “chasing the strange stillness”) without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “gaunt with a particular shame” compresses emotion, history, and politics. Figurative language is controlled (“tightened like a noose,” “sound rippling like water”) and never muddles causality. Minor redundancy in “carefully trust” and “gently persistent” slightly dulls momentum, but no loops or scaffold mar key beats. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: “cascade of purple blooms swaying... like prayers made visible” conveys setting, mood, and theme in one image. Sentence openings vary (“She carried...”, “He appeared...”, “There,”); paragraph lengths mirror breath rhythms. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—each line advances plot, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “moss-slick spans,” “crystallized light,” “golden streams that hung suspended” each advance atmosphere, character, and concept. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during disintegration (“paper grew warm, then hot”) and breathing in reflection. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent (light “unfolding dimensions,” time “feeling like soil after rain”). Final line recharges the opening motif (“walk these paths again”) with earned resonance, not redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “staggering grace of seeds splitting concrete” merges theme, image, and action. Sentence openings vary (“The chains rattled…”, “Three months she had planned…”, “Mira’s fingers traced…”), avoiding monotony. One minor overwriting slip: “chaos of old keys—door keys, padlock keys, car keys” edges toward list-like redundancy, but quickly pivots to purpose. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; closure beat (“each hole a small act of defiance transformed into grace”) remains clear and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose achieves high information density: “apple branches that pushed through shattered portholes” conveys setting, history, and resilience in one image.

Zero loops or scaffold—every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or conflict. Final line (“absence… not empty”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “moonlight pooled thick as honey,” “shadows into liquid pools,” “press my ear against destiny’s door” avoid purple excess by grounding metaphor in character perception. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—short staccato phrases during tension (“Maya set the jar”), lyrical flow in reflection. One minor slip: “quietly savvy understanding bloom” slightly abstracts, but is redeemed by immediate concrete action (“walked toward the station’s exit”). Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (glass/ice/thaw) and coheres without muddle. Minor overwriting in “captured sunset” and “theatrical cracks” slightly dilutes peak beats, but rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve cadence and revelation. Closure image (“ice fragments glittering downstream like messages”) lands with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “smudged notes that Reeves claimed contained encrypted coordinates” does triple duty (character, plot, object). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“ribs of some dying beast”) and paid off in the library’s sigh at closure. Minor overwriting in “adaptive survival instincts” leans slightly diagnostic, but it’s immediately grounded in action. Sentence variety, strong verbs, and concrete nouns maintain propulsion; no loops, scaffolds, or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ambered hush,” “marbled quiet so profound it had texture,” “geography of waiting.” Figurative language is patterned, not purple—gold leaf flakes like “captured sunlight,” silence has “substance.” Minor scaffold in “mildly obsessed” (label) slightly dulls embodiment, but cost appears immediately after (“since childhood on the pebble shore”). No loops, mixed metaphors, or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “brushes whispering against stone,” “sound emerged—not music exactly, but something between melody and mathematics.” Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances character or atmosphere. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in climax, but figurative language remains coherent (ice hums, twilight ripples). Final line (“finally understood what it meant to be awake”) lands with earned simplicity, avoiding purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “prismatic shadows,” “cryptic doodles,” “resonant hush” each pull double duty in atmosphere and theme. Sentence openings vary (“Mira worked…”, “The forecourt had earned…”, “But tonight…”), and paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One minor flaw: “ambiguously clear patterns—neither sharp nor blurred, but something in between” slightly over-explains a concept already shown through context. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “polishing something that caught the light like broken teeth” establishes tone and object in one stroke.

Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—every line advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s cadence (“blooming and withering around him, keeping its own measurements”) echoes the opening’s wisteria death, closing the texture loop without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “mechanically warm surface pulsing with contained energy” conveys tech, tactility, and anomaly in one phrase. Rhythm varies purposefully—longer sentences for atmosphere, staccato for action (“Watch.” / “Pull the lever.”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, plot, or setting. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “sideways” (three times), but it’s thematically justified and never muddles clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “ink bleeding into strange new patterns,” “lanterns blazed brighter... stains seemed to lift and swirl.” Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

Final lines achieve poetic propulsion without purple excess: “a humbler wisdom, occupying the margins where truth lives.”

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “ceramic segment worn smooth by decades of phantom workers” conveys history, texture, and haunting in one phrase). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with tension. Minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in the climax (“shadows moving with purpose… carrying guilt itself”) edges toward abstraction, but remains legible. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence propels. Figurative language is coherent (silence as water, truth as sand) and peaks without muddle. Minor deduction for one slightly purple phrase (“cryptic geometry that hurt to perceive directly”), but closure remains undulled. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, with paragraph cuts serving emotional beats (e.g., single-line “She smiled in the darkness”).

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lyrical yet precise, with high information density (“pines grew so dense that even noon felt like twilight”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“ordinary magic,” “starlight looks”) and pays off. Minor overwriting in “beneath the hush of dreaming roots”—slightly ornamental—but doesn’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line payoff (e.g., “infection had stolen his hearing at twenty-five, the same year he’d abandoned performing”). Minor overwriting in “filaments of hush” risks abstraction but is grounded by oscilloscope visuals.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “dusk painted the sky lavender and gold” avoids cliché through active verb; “horizontal vortices” conveys technical precision without jargon overload.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “molecules aligned by terror and determination” merges science, emotion, and metaphor economically. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching thematic spirals. One minor flaw: “ethically playful” slightly risks label-speak, but context (cosmic koan) redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose exhibits high information density—e.g., “circuitously sincere in her inability to admit she was becoming attached” compresses motive, trait, and irony.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“origami made of centuries,” “dictionary’s pages turned themselves”), but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “reality spiraled inward on itself” and “consciousness expanded outward while her sense of separation contracted inward” risk mixed spatial metaphors.

Minor overwriting in “tessera-studded testament” slightly strains metaphor, but not enough to blur clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances character, conflict, or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s propulsion toward wholeness feels earned, not ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose exhibits high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“applause rippled... as waves of golden warmth”). Figurative language is coherent—auroras from footsteps, leaves singing unnamed hues—and never muddled in peak beats. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates during dance then resolves in crystalline chimes.

    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“The hourglasses were accelerating because truth was unraveling”). Figurative language is coherent (“sound unfurled like a ribbon”) and sparse in high-pressure beats. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create rhythm (short for climax: “The hourglasses began to slow.”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold—e.g., “loneliness reaches out and touches other loneliness” avoids therapy-speak by grounding abstraction in physical echo. Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“raw possibility”) that briefly drifts from Mara’s pragmatic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “burned spy—discarded by his agency…” conveys backstory, status, and wound in one clause).

    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“circuits rearranging themselves into patterns that resembled laughter” conveys anomaly, tone, and thematic motif). Rhythm varies effectively—longer descriptive lines build tension, clipped phrases heighten climax (“The station's lights flickered”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors are consistent (game/board/play motifs).

Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “vibrant hush” repetition, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s propulsion—“walked further down the beach… another prophecy waited”—resolves with image, not assertion, and recharges the detour motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “darkness settle like a conspirator’s cloak” fuses atmosphere and theme in one image. Sentence openings vary (“She moved,” “In her workshop,” “‘Still working…’”), and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or texture. Figurative language is precise (“cradle of sparks,” “words… finest lockpicks”) without muddle, and closure beat (“smallest smile in the darkness”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose avoids loops/scaffold: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (e.g., “water no longer crashed but glided” establishes world *and* stakes). Figurative language is precise (“eels drifted like silk,” “dust settled like fog with weight”) without muddle. Sentence openings vary (“She was,” “The tide pools,” “Korin sprinkled”), and paragraph cuts heighten cadence—final three stones each get their own beat. Closure line (“sang mathematics... letting go”) fuses image, theme, and action without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict (“Her words had to rarefy now, become essential as oxygen”). Figurative language is coherent (lightning as prayer, scars as geography) and peaks without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; varied syntax avoids monotony. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in high-pressure beats, but no artifacts dull closure—the final lines resonate cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “brass gears visible through crystalline panels” conveys tech, class, and injury in seven words. Rhythm accelerates during decoding (“papers scattered, calculations scrawled”) then breathes at humming. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is precise (“cathedral of questions without answers”) without muddle. Final line’s cadence recharges opening light motif with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose balances lyric density with propulsion: “moonlight spilling through the library’s broken roof like liquid silver” advances atmosphere and theme. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence multitasks (e.g., “coffee tin... false compartment” reveals plot and character history). Figurative language is coherent (“sardine can” roof, “snake skin” identities) and peaks without muddle. Final lines earn their resonance through concrete action—planting—not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose achieves high information density without overwriting: “clouds that rolled like ocean waves beneath the glass floor” merges setting, metaphor, and emotional state in one breath. Figurative language is pattern-taught (tidal arbor, celluloid dreams) and payoff-precise—the projector’s hum “for nostalgic travelers” foreshadows its role in temporal navigation. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot or deepens atmosphere. Final line (“played a song about arrival”) earns its simplicity by contrast with earlier wistful complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “steam rising like small prayers” conveys ritual, warmth, and transience in six words. Sentence openings vary (“The ancient ridge...” / “Kima stood...” / “If I plant it...”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence (Prem’s arrival shifts from internal to dialogue). Minor overwriting in “genetic memory that could be planted and grown again” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure closure. Final line’s propulsion (“faith and verification finally bloom together”) ties motif to theme without purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“ink in water,” “precise blue of healing”) and avoids scaffold loops. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“particular shade of blue that exists only between sky and sea”) slightly risks purple prose but remains anchored in character perception. No filter-verb stacks or syntactic monotony; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme.
