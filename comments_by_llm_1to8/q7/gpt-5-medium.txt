  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (glass hears, frost writes, wind braids with stars) coheres under the lyric mode taught early. However, density suffers from paraphrase loops: "purpose lived in pauses because pauses were doors" restates the stated motivation without added pressure. Template cadence appears in mid-section runs ("I knelt...I told...I read...I pressed...I laid...I retraced...I rose"). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh specificity ("black sun," "dust of soot as tiny drought" strains). The closure beat avoids these patterns, keeping it above the artifact cap, but mid-section redundancy and elevated abstraction trigger −0.6 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and purposeful rhythm ("heat gathers where longing knots, cools where fear retreats"). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor artifacts: "silently expressive" repeated verbatim across beats; "after noise becomes impossible" functions as a template refrain without evolution; "We live inside a paradox" and "permission to continue" drift toward abstract summary. One paraphrase loop: the explanation of sorrow/remembrance/hope is restated in the leaf-weighting passage. No pervasive template cadence or filter-verb stacks, and figurative language remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally, information density is high, and sentence openings diversify. Figurative language is purposeful and mostly coherent ("inadvertently stubborn in the way a tide forgets," "shelves lean like old divers"). Deductions: "chased stillness" recurs frequently as a label without sufficient fresh embodiment in each use (−0.3), and a few lines approach paraphrase loops ("I keep arranging shards" appears twice in close succession; "distress signals" cycling through beats without new pressure adds −0.2). The closure beat is clean, so caps remain above 8.0, but high-band entry requires tighter loop discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and occasionally muddy: "rust-red rib cage," "winter lung," "a line drawn through our fear in thin shining metal" cluster without clear causal linkage. Some paraphrase loops appear ("We knew why the secrecy mattered; there were lists somewhere" / "our elders feared raids, our youths feared irrelevance"). Template cadence is mild but present in several "and" chains. Information density is strong in the middle third (food runs, constellation naming), and the final image lands cleanly. No major loops in peak beats, but the opening paragraph's metaphor stack ("brittle with frost and held breath," "rust-red rib cage") slightly obscures spatial grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high throughout ("fog lucidity," "pilgrim of sparks," "river reads them as if they were meant for its far estuary"). This creates lush texture but also triggers overwriting in peak beats: the closure paragraph stacks metaphors (storage closet, decant, emptied jars, river adjustment) that blur the single decisive image. Paraphrase loops appear: "unused love is stored" recurs across multiple lines without added pressure. Sentence openings vary and no major grammar errors, but the figurative load slows momentum in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout, which suits the lyric mode, but some metaphors stack without clear payoff: "letters rise like gnats, then settle as soot in me" is vivid, but the transition from gnats to soot feels slightly forced. Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "I + verb" stems and "the + noun + verb" constructions across consecutive lines, creating a drumbeat that flattens momentum. Information density is generally strong (most lines do double duty), but paraphrase loops appear: "I designed it after the fire" is closely echoed by "when soot learned to speak in my breathing" without added pressure. The opening and closing images are strong, and syntactic variety improves in the final third. Proofreading is clean, and the prose avoids therapy-speak or stock metaphors, but the middle section would benefit from tighter compression and varied sentence openings.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with lyric parallelism ("She is patiently strategic," "She is a liberator," "She will reach it") that coheres as voice rather than artifact. Information density is high: most lines advance setting, action, or image. Minor loop detected: "staggering grace" appears three times with near-identical phrasing, and "She is..." stem recurs without sufficient variation in the opening third, creating template cadence that slightly dulls momentum. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks. The piece leans heavily on figurative language (almost every sentence carries metaphor or elevated image), which risks overwriting but remains legible and voice-consistent throughout. Penalty capped at −0.4 for non-closure loops per the accumulation rule.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is polished and rhythmically varied, with high information density in most beats ("shells cling to twigs and remember storms by salted scars"). However, the piece exhibits paraphrase loops: "I came here to find the sound of trust breaking" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure, and the phrase "the impact of memories" appears verbatim three times as scaffolding. The closing third compresses several years of implication into summary ("I made one final imprint... Then I walked the aisles") rather than dramatizing the pivot, dulling momentum at a key juncture.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in navigation beats. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without clear escalation pattern: "sky folded its burning map," "moths stitched our way with translucence," "night rifled through clouds." Mixed metaphors appear ("destiny's door" / "hidden room engineers once used") and some lines paraphrase without added pressure: "light skimmed the green tiles, making the station truly emerald" restates the opener's emerald lake image. Template stems recur: "I + verb" structures dominate. Stock poetic moves—"tender, ruinous gratitude," "translucence"—cluster in the final third, dulling the closure beat's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in most beats. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "narrated the act of breathing" / "narrated again as he wiped a switch" / "narrating each latch and lever" / "he narrated the rotation" creates template cadence across four distinct moments (−0.5). Mixed metaphor in "breed heat from patience" (heat is bred?) and "ferreted flask" (ferret as adjective?) muddle clarity slightly (−0.3). Figurative density in the final third—"day loosened its teeth," "breath that carried the flavor of salt and propane," "evening came like a thoughtful stagehand"—crowds without pattern payoff (−0.4). No major causality breaks, so penalties stay in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively ("Heights, water, crowds, mirrors, and the smell of fake blood" accelerates; "The shell hummed whenever I guessed a letter right" breathes). Strong verbs and specific nouns predominate. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "transformative betrayal" recurs as a label across three paragraphs without added pressure; "whispering/whisper" appears in four adjacent lines; "shaking hands/hands shook" repeats the same image. The line "He let me take his credits, his stunts, his dangers. / He took my name and family and hid like fog" shows effective parallelism, but stock metaphors like "fog" and "breath I had been saving" lack specificity. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems touching mid-story beats, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor density.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative language is dense and often purposeful ("gold leaf bruising under rain like ripened fruit," "sea graduates into a gentler noise"), but several adjacent sentences restate concepts without added pressure: "Night speaks in lacunae" followed immediately by oracle learning "to retell its migrations...with contours." Template cadence appears in runs: "the cliff's hush, the lantern's doubt, the rain's skipped heartbeats" lists accumulate without syntactic variation. Stock phrasing ("older than tides," "lighter than surrender") dulls two peak beats. Information density is high overall, but paraphrase loops in the middle third apply −0.6 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual cadence that matches the looped structure. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic pressure without padding. Some overwriting in the middle third: "Meaning is the way the petals remember they were gears" and adjacent metaphor-dense lines cluster without clear escalation, triggering mild density concern (~−0.3). "Composure, like polish, is a film you must reapply with motion" exemplifies strong craft, but the piece accumulates figurative language in several consecutive beats without pattern-teaching. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Propulsion remains clear; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high and most lines advance character or atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and the opening/closing images anchor the arc. However, paraphrase loops appear: "after words become unnecessary" (line 1, line 16), "agreements are etched in reflections and apologies...condense" then "confession wears a mask," and "the story arrives without voice, after words become unnecessary, and yet it persuades." Template cadence runs in early beats: "I lift...I tilt...I shiver." The final third is clean and propulsive, but scaffold in the first half costs clarity under pressure. Apply −0.6 for loops/templates per the patterned-artifact penalty pack (Q7 only).

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance image, choice, or ritual. Opening "After luck becomes measurable" anchors premise and voice immediately. Minimal scaffolding or loops, though some phrases trend abstract ("necessary kindness," "attentive weather"). Figurative language ("hedges hissed," "luck's needles steadied") remains coherent and embodied. The line "Each marble stood for a past victory, small and worn but still colored" demonstrates efficient layering of object, history, and state. Minor register drift in "mended deception as penance, not performance" slightly elevates beyond established voice, but remains legible. Sentence variety and rhythm support the accumulative design without mechanical repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template runs. Information density is high—most lines do double work (e.g., "lever...smeared with a century of anxious hands" = history + tactile dread). No paraphrase loops detected. A few figurative choices stack without muddle: "harp for the wind," "corridor of possibility," "city mid-yawn" all land clearly. Minor friction: "icy warmth" recurs four times, twice as pure descriptor without added pressure, nudging toward motif-for-motif's-sake; the phrase does charge the ending laugh, so net effect is positive but the repetition slightly dulls mid-story momentum. One scaffold phrase: "somewhere sideways from the weather" reads as poetic filler. Propulsion remains strong through peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative density is high but largely coherent ("lanterns hung like tired moons," "door that swells," "print align"). Information density is strong: most lines advance image, atmosphere, and plot. However, several beats rely on template-stem cadence ("I [verb] and [noun]" appears across multiple sentences in the middle third), and a few metaphors wobble (the portrait "unbuttons" into a door—mixing clothing and architecture—then the musician "crosses by placing weight in the in between spaces, on glints not water, on breath not word," which stacks abstractions without concrete anchoring). Paraphrase loop: the closing lines repeat "in between spaces" and "wordless conversation" without added pressure. No single artifact touches the closure beat decisively, so deduction remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, and information density is high. The smudge/gentian/margin motifs recur with purpose. Minor deductions: "swaying certainties" recurs as explicit phrase in two places, creating light paraphrase; "auroral sorrow" bookends but risks stock poeticism; a few lines ("I reach toward it without meaning to confess") carry slight filter-verb stack. The closure image is clean, but earlier beats carry faint template cadence in participial openers ("talking about," "occupying margins").

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines doing double duty (e.g., "Beads of condensation ringed it like a rosary, and grease made the beads shine" anchors setting, motif, and tactile focus). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor deduction for near-synonym repetition in tight sequence: "hush," "quiet," "silent" appear within the opening three beats without functional variation, and "weight" recurs six times in the final third, some instances nearing redundancy ("weight of a swallowed truth," "weight does not lie," "weight arrived in my arms," "memory of the weight"). Figurative language is generally coherent, though "drowsy alertness, a poised fatigue" edges toward contradictory abstraction. Syntax is purposeful; the prose breathes in step with scene pressure. Clarity and propulsion are strong; no line-level opacity or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and voice-motivated; however, several lines approach metaphor muddle ("silence is not absence but compost," "change whispers, and I call every whisper a tide"). Template cadence appears in the "Sometimes...Sometimes" parallel structure (lines 16–17), but it reads as purposeful rhythm rather than artifact. A few paraphrase loops: "I grip reality loosely" (line 6) echoes in "I do not grip decisions anymore" (line 37), and "crumbling peace" recurs without added pressure (lines 3, 19). Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (the swan as map and metaphor), but others linger in description without advancing situation. Propulsion is steady but not urgent; the prose breathes rather than accelerates. No grammar errors or clarity breaks. Artifact deduction: −0.4 for paraphrase loop and template stems that dull momentum in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines layer action, image, and emotional charge (e.g., "the metal ticking faintly against her wedding band" anchors grief in sound and gesture). Rhythm varies across the eclipse sequence, accelerating into totality and breathing through the return of light. Two minor scaffolds: "Ordinary magic is not a rebellion against the world; it is the world doing what it does when we notice" reads as thematic capsule rather than scene pressure, and "I wanted the dark to teach us to listen to what the light usually erases" borders on abstract mission statement. No loops or template cadence; figurative language (moon as "patient moth," shadows "crisp like paper cuts") remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information load per line and varied rhythm that breathes with scene needs. Metaphors are coherent and specific ("reclines like a fallen compass needle," "dust flurries like moths, each wing a different year"). Minor template-cadence slips appear in the middle third ("They tell… They describe… They remember"), applying a −0.3 deduction, but do not touch the closure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs cleanly. Zero paraphrase loops; clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives ("The lighthouse is not haunted; it is simply patient") alternate with complex lyricism. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction: a few metaphors approach overwriting density in the opening third ("harbor's neon fizzed out like a tired constellation" followed closely by "island exhaled" and "gull or a fingerprint trying to fly"), though they remain coherent and voice-motivated. The closure beat is clean and propulsive. Zero scaffold or filter-verb stacks in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high, and figurative language (ultramarine "winked like a tiny bruise," quiet "torn open by invisible fingers") charges key beats without becoming opaque. However, the accumulation of metaphor in consecutive sentences occasionally slows momentum: "The sanctuary filled with muffled clarity, the kind that lets you hear your shield crack" stacks two conceits without advancing situation. Template cadence appears in the anaphora sequence, though this is pattern-taught and functional. One paraphrase loop: "It slipped toward the palette, curious" and "invited the whisper to speak to its reflection" restate the same move. Proofreading is clean; no scaffolding or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.9)
    High information density and varied rhythm support the accumulative design. However, overwriting clusters in mid-passage: "whale-slow groans," "delicate way," "exact tempo of the noon I lost," and "sated by its own echo" stack figurative language without clear payoff. A paraphrase loop appears: "I do not dare write words now; I diagram breaths" restates the prior beat's shift from pen to shell. Minor template cadence in the memory sequence ("First the kitchen…Then the classroom…Next the library…Finally the hospital") is functional but mechanical. No loops touch the closure beat, so deductions cap at −0.6 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and sentence openings vary, supporting the lyric design. Information density is high in key beats (tablet warming, puddles rearranging, shadow returning). However, the piece exhibits pervasive overwriting: nearly every sentence deploys figurative language ("sleeping cicadas," "ferns opening under caustic starlight," "arguments finally out of words") without pattern-teaching payoff, creating a density that obscures rather than propels. Mixed metaphors appear ("puddles were altars," "timelines fanned beneath my feet," "corridor inside me") that shift vehicle mid-image. Register drift into abstraction ("procedural generation," "periodically eternal") clashes with embodied action in peak beats. Paraphrase loops are present: "I did not live forever, but I lived again and again" restates without adding pressure. Applying overwriting density (−0.5), register drift (−0.4), and loop (−0.2) totals significant line-level debt, though the closure image ("rain on my tongue and no urgency to fly") remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "lighthouse at fog's edge," "moons," "riverbeds," "tide that had consulted the moon," "vinyl." In peak beats (the ritual, the threading), metaphor stacks without always advancing causality—"filament of hush" recurs but shifts meaning only slightly across uses. Paraphrase loop: "She believed backward recorded songs might coax lost feelings to surface" is restated by the next paragraph's ritual enactment. Template cadence: several "She [verb]" openers in the final third. Clarity remains high, but density occasionally slows momentum. Information load per sentence is strong in the cavern setup but thins in the closing.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and purposeful compression. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor template cadence appears in the middle third ("I listened… I placed… I folded…") and a few metaphors edge toward stock ("doubt rose like heat"), but these do not touch closure. The final paragraph's clarity and propulsion are exemplary ("the pigeon became a dot, the dot a memory, the memory a pressure rising toward rain"). No paraphrase loops or major artifacts; line-level execution supports rather than hinders momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—most sentences carry metaphor or elevated diction—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff that charges closure. Examples: "violet arithmetic," "tasted like metal on my tongue," "looped around a stalagmite, then around my waist," "loom might weave a childhood" cluster without letting concrete action breathe. Paraphrase appears: "I came with a motive and a mischief" / "My motive was to discover…my mischief was to do it…" restates across adjacent lines. Template stems recur: "I [verb]" opens many sentences in the opening third. Syntax varies within paragraphs, but the cumulative ornamental load flattens momentum in the mirror and canyon beats where pressure should peak. Apply artifact penalty −0.8 for density + loops + stem repetition (Q7 only).

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("chronic hush begins to braid itself," "apples bloom white scars"). Overwriting penalty: metaphoric density is high across most beats without clear pattern-teaching, and some vehicles mix ("hush braids," "bow nods like a patient bird," "hull learns to forgive the current"). Minor paraphrase loop: "magnificent simplicity" appears as both concept and direct phrase near the end. Propulsion slows mid-piece when exposition about the mother and tradition interrupts the greenhouse scene. No major clarity breaks, but the figurative load in a ~1,400-word piece nudges toward ornament over function.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is densely figurative with strong rhythmic control and varied syntax. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Deductions: pervasive metaphoric density in nearly every sentence creates mild cognitive load ("sandalwood listened for regret, bergamot pressed for alertness") that occasionally slows momentum rather than sharpening it. A few near-paraphrase loops appear ("counterfeit" recurs as theme-word without always advancing pressure). The figurative language is coherent but borders on over-saturation in the middle third, triggering −0.5 for density without full pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("envelope... its paper fibers snapping open like sails," "sky holds its breath"), but template cadence recurs in the middle third: "They decide to trace," "They learn the man," "They send a letter," "Mara asks her to speak." This stem repetition creates a list-like momentum drag, triggering −0.4. Paraphrase loops appear: "recognition can be risky, but secrecy has taxed the town's spirit" and "this is a ledger of harbor music" both restate the uplift motive without added pressure. "Cautious exuberance" is asserted twice without embodied variance. High information density in the opening and closing partially offsets mid-section scaffolding, but the accumulation of minor artifacts caps high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level clarity is strong; syntax varies and rhythm modulates (short beats at discovery, longer reflection at closure). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or stakes. Minor issues: "webs of kinship" and "rhymes of root and glint" repeat the same idea across adjacent sentences (paraphrase loop, −0.2). "Luminescent ache" recurs without deepening (−0.2). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "singing bowl" crater and "chiming" orchard land without muddle. Opening and closing lines anchor well.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template stems. Information density is high: most lines advance image, action, or thematic layer. Minor loop: "hush, rush, hush, rush" appears twice, the second time as callback rather than churn. Figurative language is dense but coherent; no mixed metaphors. One hairline slip: "Its halves balanced like two ponds contemplating their shared shore" is evocative but slightly strained as physical description of a pendant. Proofreading is clean; no scaffolding or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, multiple paraphrase loops and template patterns appear: "He learned to fold silence…a gently inventive ritual" echoes "His conjuring is secretive…by craft"; "He wonders if emotion can be graphed" is restated as "if sorrow approaches a limit"; "dovetail" appears three times in similar constructions. Several sentences open with "He [verb]" across consecutive lines. Figurative language is dense throughout (mineral sweetness, theorem wearing festival clothes, lacquer taking fingerprints) without clear pattern-teaching, risking overwriting in a high-pressure beat. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.4, density without payoff −0.3, total −1.1 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("sapphire hush," "tide pooling after night withdraws," "body a letter folded to fit"), creating a lyric texture. However, several beats loop or paraphrase: "He was a kindly methodical soul" / "kindly methodical even in joy"; "while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage" appears twice verbatim, the second time mid-story without pattern payoff. Overwriting is present in peak beats—"hair haloed, pockets full of catalog cards, eyes glazed with sleep and unshed worry"—stacking modifiers that slow momentum. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "He" + verb across paragraphs. Clarity remains high overall, but density occasionally substitutes for propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and aural variety. Information density is high (lines serve multiple jobs: "It was not a tangle but a treaty, and she signed by stepping aside"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Small deduction for mild register drift in a few phrases ("allotted frames," "sustaining transformation") that edge slightly above the established idiom, and one instance of near-redundancy ("reluctant metamorphosis" concept restated across multiple lines without strict necessity). Clarity and propulsion remain strong through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Propulsion is strong; information density high ("They ran from roofs to roots, collecting stories"). Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("gulls threaded a cry through my ribs," "surf whispered names along the shingle"). Minor template cadence in the middle third: several "We [verb]" constructions cluster without variation. No loops or scaffold; clarity remains high under compression. The final paragraph sustains rhythm and delivers closure without overwriting, though "bright as breath" and "did not scatter" risk slight abstraction compared to the tactile specificity earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but coherent within the taught lyric mode. Information density is strong: "a locket of syllables forged by drips and patience" does multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in the opening third: three consecutive "We/I/The" sentence stems without variation. One paraphrase loop: "I did not see it coming" recurs twice without added pressure. No loops or artifacts touch the closure beat. Propulsion is maintained despite compression.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "She traces it on the fogged pane, and every curve erases water, leaving the city revealing itself"). Rhythm varies purposefully. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor deductions: "staggered intervals" appears four times across the piece without taught pattern payoff, trending toward churn (−0.3). "Here the drummer lost a stick, here an embrace reversed direction, here she first felt returned" uses anaphora purposefully but borders repetitive stem without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative density is high but coherent and voice-motivated; no mixed metaphors. Clean grammar and pronoun clarity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure: "arrows in pavement braided into invitations," "rooms yawned, each shaped like a word unsaid," "stones breathed like animals." Several paraphrase loops appear ("I traced them carefully" / "I followed to find"; "trembling certainty" recurs without reweighting). Template cadence runs dominate: "I [verb]" stems appear across nine consecutive sentences in the depot-to-train sequence. Register drift into abstract philosophical diction ("analytically artistic," "ramparts of listening") clashes with the practical cartographer role. Cumulative penalty: −1.4 for density + loops + template cadence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (each line advances character, atmosphere, or concept). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("stone rib cage," "whales rose, leaving spirals of air," "entangled memories"). Minor overwriting in peak beats: "the sums on the tile cooled into balance" and "the walls hummed like patient lungs" stack metaphor. A few template-adjacent stems ("I told him... then offered," "Lio asked... and I said") in quick succession. No paraphrase loops or major scaffold; proofreading is clean. The density occasionally obscures immediate causality but not fatally.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistic, with strong opening and closing lines. Sentence variety supports the lyric mode. However, multiple issues accumulate: paraphrase loops ("Hushed thunder breathed outside" / "Hushed thunder is the dialect of things that are nearly born"), template cadence in adjacent lines ("I set… I told… I wanted…"), and dense figurative stacking in peak beats ("prisms tasted his breath, fragment flashed a wound-colored grin") that blurs clarity. The Text-Artifact screen flags synonym churn around "hushed thunder" and elevated diction that drifts from the POV's immediacy under pressure. These artifacts don't obscure causality but do dull momentum in the corridor sequence, the story's highest-stakes moment.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse and information density is high (most lines do two jobs: advance plot and charge imagery). "Waiting actively is like polishing a mirror; the reflection arrives because the cloth never stops" is fresh and voice-specific. Minor issues: "small moon, stubborn and elegant" and "little moon with tides" recur without added pressure; "liquefies rigid thinking in me with a sound" is slightly opaque. A few adjacent lines paraphrase the fairness-math concept ("inverse function," "mathematics of a fair trade," "proportion"), creating mild synonym churn in the thematic register. No template cadence or filter stacks. Propulsion is strong; peak beats (reset chime, handing the ledger) remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: nearly every line advances ritual, image, or thematic weight. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates between short declaratives ("I stayed") and longer accretions ("Texture is not touch alone…"). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor friction: a handful of elevated metaphors cluster without clear payoff ("wind crawls through alleys and knocks at shutters with patient knuckles" feels decorative rather than pressure-driven). One possible template stem: "I [verb]" recurs across six lines in the opening third but serves voice consistency rather than mechanical churn. No clarity breaks, no grammar slips, strong propulsion to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("salt and shuffled by cranes," "oily constellations," "silence with fingerprints"). Information density is high: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or the fragment-gathering plot. Minor deductions: a few near-paraphrase loops ("I filter reality differently" echoed as "the world sifts through me, and I filter reality differently again") and slight overwriting in the opening third where metaphor appears in most sentences without full payoff until later. The closure beat is clean. Syntax varies and propulsion is strong; no grammar errors or ambiguous references. The final image—"layering new stories over the old until morning"—recharges earlier motifs without overt statement.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stake—and the rhythm modulates purposefully (short bursts during the tuning sequence, longer cadences during reflection). Figurative language is pervasive but mostly coherent within the protagonist's voice (the cello "settling like an old boat," the compass as "a sensation rather than a rotation"). Two frictions: paraphrase loops appear ("retell" recurs across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure, and "gloomy cheerfulness" is restated in the penultimate line after being established early) and some metaphors mix vehicles without clear integration ("the dome becomes a book spine" followed immediately by "everything begins happening inside the whisper of closing pages"—the metaphor shifts from spine to interior without transition). Syntax varies, and no filter-verb stacks appear. Proofreading is clean. The loops and one mixed metaphor prevent entry to the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines advance situation or character ("By dawn the carnival had learned new ways to breathe, and the fences began to look lost"). Rhythm varies purposefully with scene pressure. Deductions for minor figurative muddle in the opening ("sea kept its own counsel in patient syllables" mixes vehicles) and a few template stems in the middle third ("We sent instructions… A streak of cobalt meant… copper dots meant"). The closure beat is clean and propulsive. No paraphrase loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Each pit recorded a visitor whose name we would never know, a ledger of urgency burned into basalt" advances setting, theme, and tonal pressure). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the timed vials sequence and breathing in the final moth beat. Minor deductions for figurative density: several adjacent sentences in the opening third stack metaphors ("crater was only a silver bowl holding a slow breath," "satellites taught the sky to buzz like a hive") without pattern-teaching, occasionally slowing momentum. One paraphrase slip: "I did not cry, but the crater and the summit and the moon conspired to make my throat clean and still" restates embodied emotion already shown. No loops or template cadence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in peak beats (fog fold, code patch, final coupling). However, pervasive figurative layering and elevated diction create texture drag: "harbor bells stutter," "timbers groaning like a great throat," "metal vowels," "drumhead," "pebbles," "chalk crack," "bright coin"—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or simile, and several mix vehicles (mist as gauze, sound as beads, then as vowels). Template cadence appears in the opening third (repeated "she" + verb stems). Apply −0.6 for density and coherence slip, −0.3 for template stems, totaling roughly −0.9 within the non-closure cap. Minor loops: "examining light refraction through water features" repeated verbatim. Closure beat itself remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and aural texture. Information density is high—most lines advance image, choice, or atmosphere—and no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Deductions: "a sound like a door considering whether to close" and "water moved black and holy" veer toward strained metaphor in high-pressure beats; "lines gathered from the corners, leaned toward one another, and stitched a trembling vein" is vivid but dense enough to slow the valve-turn moment slightly. No artifacts touch the closure beat. Propulsion is strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout with some mixed vehicles: "dark tongue wavered like a blackbird testing wind" (fork as tongue/bird), "tail writing cursive in the dust" (charming but ornamental). Template cadence appears in the middle third: "He struck...He set...He paced...He closed...He would be...He passed...He lifted...He told...He said...He asked...He felt...He led...He whispered...He asked...He dreamt." This stem repetition flattens momentum across ~15 lines. Information density is strong in the opening and closing thirds. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding, but the overwriting in peak beats (bell-ringing moment) adds texture without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, choice, or stakes. Minor pattern artifacts appear—"gathered hush" recurs frequently, "overriding instinct" is used twice in near-identical phrasing—but these function as motif rather than loop and do not obscure causality. One figurative reach ("touch memories, a breath of someone else's lilacs") verges on abstraction but remains anchored to the vial. No paraphrase loops; propulsion is clean through the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    Figurative language is dense but largely coherent ("the lighthouse sustains impossibilities the way a jar keeps a firefly," "the guards let me wander because I said I was cataloging the corrosion"). A few lines overreach: "gulls learned to laugh like they were practicing a verdict" mixes trial and rehearsal metaphors awkwardly, and "if I kept silent, I could steer the current of what came next" introduces nautical control that doesn't match the lighthouse-as-jar or lattice-as-confession logic established earlier. Information density is high; minimal loops or scaffolding appear, though the final third revisits "hush," "lattice," and "doors" without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.3)
    Figurative density is high ("glass arterial with vines," "cinders fell like confetti that remembered the burn") and mostly coherent, though "breath like a vow" recurs three times without pattern payoff. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates from reflective openings to clipped coaching beats. One paraphrase loop: "ephemeral cameo appearances" is repeated verbatim across two paragraphs without reweighting, triggering −0.2. Information density is strong; nearly every line advances atmosphere or coaching. The closing beat—"correcting my gratitude to action"—lands without scaffold. No major opacity or template cadence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly coherent ("anemones tuck in like closed eyes," "nets hang like gray rain"). However, density dips in the middle third with near-paraphrase: "I cannot breathe their absence without doing" followed by "so I sew their names" repeats the same emotional content. Template cadence in the final third: "I am still…still…and the rope now…" stacks parallel constructions without added pressure. Minor register drift: "orchid solace" and "continual yeses" feel slightly elevated for peak beats. No severe loops, but accumulation of these artifacts prevents entry to the 8+ band and disallows 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("roots snake between bones," "faith…interrupted, like a traveler delayed by rain and invited to share tea," "orchard…a mouth"), creating textural richness but occasionally slowing momentum in mid-passage beats where causal links are already clear. A few paraphrase loops: "interrupted journeys announced themselves everywhere" followed immediately by examples, then later "faith had not been lost, only interrupted" restates the same idea. Template cadence in the final third: several sentences open with time markers or participial phrases in quick succession ("At dusk…," "Around us…," "We angled…," "The shadow kissed…"). No filter-verb stacks or major clarity breaks. Information density is strong when tied to objects (sundial base, gnomon, stele), but some lines do double metaphorical work without advancing situation. Overall: vivid and controlled, with minor momentum drag from figurative clustering.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, with most lines advancing action, world logic, or interiority. Strong figurative choices ("the vaults hold a hush like stacked envelopes," "speed kills certain meanings the same way glare erases chalk") anchor the voice. Paraphrase loops appear in the middle third: "They wanted to tell a person who no longer claims the letter of their name. / They wanted the message to take the long way" restates intent without adding pressure (−0.2). The final paragraph's stacked philosophical declarations ("The present leans into the past like a lover," "meaning arranges itself like a flock") create mild decorative density that slows the closure beat without obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high ("sky were cold and wanted a shawl," "moth," "cello under the stars") and mostly coherent, supporting the lyric mode. Sentence openings vary. Information density is solid; most lines advance image or Stakes. Two deductions: (1) paraphrase loop in the middle third—"whisper told me," "whisper hardened into speech"—restates without added pressure (−0.2); (2) filter-verb stack in reflective beats ("I recognized," "I asked," "I told") clusters in three adjacent paragraphs, slightly dulling immediacy (−0.3). Subtract −0.5 total. The final image is clean and propulsive, so non-closure cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and occasionally risks mixed metaphor ("the hinge sighed shut" pairs oddly with "the cathedral gave us its tooth"). Paraphrase loops appear: "I was only saving my fear" closely restates prior confession without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("I ask… / They cannot… / So I practice…") flattens momentum briefly. Clarity holds, and the final image is clean, but pervasive metaphor in peak beats triggers −0.5 under the overwriting check. Information density is high; rhythm supports the meditative pace.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language is vivid without stacking ("kestrels coil into sleep like commas"). However, several lines verge on overwriting: "a lotus-hearted ache that is somehow bearable" elevates diction without clear POV motivation, and "war-bell dulls to a gong of rain" mixes metaphors. The opening's mist/coral/vents breath is strong, but mid-story the prose occasionally prioritizes texture over propulsion. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; grammar is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("fog made my studio, the lanes my corridor"), but several beats stack metaphors without advancing pressure: "fog-bitten," "cotton air," "soft bells" cluster without propulsion. Template cadence is minimal, but paraphrase loops appear: "the film, once merely exposed, became revealing, like fruit opening willingly" restates the prior correction sequence. Lines like "joy is more obedient when applauded" veer into aphorism that flattens momentum. Proofreading is clean; rhythm varies but occasionally sags under ornamental phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance image, character, or pressure. Sentence rhythm modulates well (short declaratives at key beats, longer lyric swells during discovery). The recurring "pause between question and reply" is pattern-taught and non-looping. Minor artifact cluster: "nested awakenings" appears three times within ~200 words mid-story, risking synonym loop; "methodically playful" is invoked twice as label. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one mixed vehicle ("echoes…climbed…fell back" then "folded like birds") muddies the sensory anchor slightly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Closure beats are clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense, with strong opening and closing lines. Figurative language is pervasive but mostly controlled; however, several beats stack metaphors without clear connective tissue ("warp the space between thoughts," "lay silence like mulch," "stitched routes with thread, a warp of stolen twine"), creating minor opacity. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "We learned to…," "We would…," "Our method was…," "Our pattern read…" (−0.4). A paraphrase loop: "the city felt the converging chaos" / "the greenhouse turned into converging chaos" restates the title phrase without added pressure (−0.2). No scaffolding or major pronoun drift. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support momentum, and the climax compresses effectively. The artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is extreme and sustained across most beats without clear pressure payoff: "galaxy postcard," "blossom armistice," "reef-shadow joy," "chlorophyll woven from losses," "routes of amnesty, ports of rest." Mixed metaphors abound (photosynthesis of sorrows, reefs extruding gardens, tides as motives). Template cadence dominates: "I woke," "I curated," "I was to send," "I was shyly," "I tried," "I wrote," "I hummed," "I hesitated," "I lay"—ten sentences begin with "I [past verb]" (−0.6). Paraphrase loops: "via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" appears verbatim three times. Information density is low; many lines restate thematic claims without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("mothwing of cooled thunder," "gravity were finally convinced by its commitment to memory"), but clusters in nearly every sentence without always advancing pressure or clarity. Lines like "Each desk stands numbered by the echo of a long-forgotten song, a catalog audible to the patient" and "The library floats on tethered balloons stitched from cloudskin" are vivid but read as decorative in their initial context. Template stems recur: "I [verb]" opens multiple paragraphs ("I follow," "I light," "I touch," "I set," "I sew," "I write," "I walk," "I do not watch," "I note," "I sweep," "I lean"). No paraphrase loops, but the figurative density without pattern-teaching slightly dulls momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative density ("dust motes…footnote to vanished grammars," "lamplight seemed a promise kept") generally supports the linguist's lens. However, several beats show paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "I composed an answer to his absence. Not a letter, not a demand, but a suite of promises inviting reply" restates the same content across three clauses without added pressure. Template cadence appears mid-story: "The first movement promised…The second promised…The third promised" uses identical stems without pattern-teaching payoff. Stock metaphors recur: "opened doors," "unblurring," "leaning into." These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats. Information density is high in the composition sequence but sags during the salt-ravine flashback, which summarizes rather than dramatizes the inciting rift.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character stance, or world logic. Figurative language is pervasive and mostly coherent, but the density becomes a momentum drag in high-pressure beats: "dappled resolve flickered across the sunshafts, mottling my tools as if the mountain approved and disapproved in the same breath" front-loads lyricism where clarity and propulsion are needed. Template cadence appears in parallel structures: "rock must sleep, said the ash-keepers; and my own heart thrummed between them" / "the traders frowned, then nodded when the hum turned to a rhythm." Paraphrase loop: "The building breathes" recurs as a stem across multiple paragraphs without adding new pressure each time. No major syntax errors or clarity breaks, but the overwriting in peak moments justifies moderate deduction per the Overwriting Checks.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level control is strong: rhythm varies, information density is high, and figurative language is coherent (dust as clock, meteorite chip as ember, history as letter). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and resonate. However, a few repetitive stems appear ("I train," "I roost," "I steer," "I send," "I write") across the first half, and one paraphrase loop ("the echo of lost songs" recurs without added pressure in early paragraphs). These minor artifacts in non-closure beats prevent entry to the 8.5+ band but do not obscure causality or dull the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift across declarative, participial, and prepositional anchors. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, interiority, or thematic layering. Minorループ: "necessary distances" recurs four times across paragraphs without added pressure in two instances (−0.2). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "color that never settled," "shadows arranged themselves into fields," "compass made of breaths" feel voice-motivated. One strained metaphor: "benches waited like patient animals" then immediately pivots to "wooden, old, and worn by people who were not yet born when the sky cracked"—the temporal claim contradicts the established post-butterfly-effect present (−0.3). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Propulsion slows in the middle third during extended grain-reading but recovers at the seam-opening turn.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "constellations of silt and wire," "glass fronds swayed like thought," "silver skein," "fish whirled like punctuation." In peak beats (sentinel test, memory engine interaction), metaphor stacks risk opacity: "shadowseam wonder, all half-light edges" reads ornamental rather than propulsive. Template stems appear: "I am…," "We…," "The…" open multiple consecutive sentences without purposeful pattern. Paraphrase loops: "luminous respite" is named, then explained as "not a retreat…but a world agreeing to breathe with you," then reiterated in the final lines. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty, others linger. No major causality breaks, so artifacts stay in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level craft is competent with poetic compression and varied syntax: "Heat hums in a key between sorrow and laughter," "We respect the revision and walk a footnote that becomes a poem." Figurative density is high and largely coherent, though some vehicles stretch plausibility ("path that once glittered with footsteps like minnows," "cheerful gloom"). Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines (e.g., "The path is not stolen; it has edited itself" / "the path closed its eyes because the earth was blinking"). Filter verbs and interpretive scaffolding recur ("I see," "I know now," "I feel"), dulling immediacy in a few beats. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate thematic points without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in most beats. However, persistent overwriting and metaphor density reduce clarity and momentum: "silence is a weather vane," "moonlight washing his badge into an old lake," "breath weaving ladders the tide keeps stealing," "the arcade ribs arch like a cathedral," "nickel nebulae," "itinerant chessboards," "photons," "moonwater," "room without walls." These stack in adjacent lines without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the Overwriting Checks penalty (−0.6 for density and register drift). No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the figurative load in high-density beats dulls propulsion. Proofreading is clean. The accumulation of ornamental metaphor, especially in the middle third, prevents high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structures and vivid sensory anchors ("pale as low tide sand, trembling like a string before a bow draws breath"). However, figurative language saturates most sentences in the tattooing sequence without respite, creating density that slows momentum: "obsidian grace," "the basin held a moon that chose not to rise," "the instrument an oath that would harmonize anyone who read it aloud." Several lines loop conceptually—paragraphs 19–20 restate the completion of the verse in slightly varied metaphor. The final third carries multiple template stems ("I would…") and the closing paragraph recycles "enough for" three times. Minor pronoun ambiguity when "their" could refer to either the cartographer or the city in context. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 under the patterned-artifact pack, and the high figurative density in peak beats adds −0.4 for overwriting, totaling −1.2 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally with purposeful compression ("A winter of deals, a spring of survey flags") and lyric patterning (the pond-and-stone ritual, the noctilucent passage). Information density is high: most lines advance theme, character, or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "I want to illuminate value in the mundane" is restated as "I want the day to hold, just long enough to show the town that their ordinary mornings were already luminous," and the final two paragraphs recycle the atrium-breathing metaphor without adding pressure. Template cadence in the "I see... I see... I want... I want... I say... He says..." runs across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("breath becomes window," "edges can speak calmly") appear in peak beats without fresh vehicles. These artifacts touch the closure third but do not obscure causality, so penalties route here. Applying patterned-artifact baseline: −0.8 for loops and template runs, plus −0.3 for stock metaphors = −1.1 total, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance image, character, and theme simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully, from compressed opening fragments to longer meditative beats during waiting to tight exchange during repair. Minor deductions for two template-cadence runs: "He pictured... then pictured... He saw... He did not forgive..." uses identical stems across four sentences; and occasional filter-verb stacks ("he used to say," "he had found," "he had written") that slightly dull immediacy in non-peak beats. No paraphrase loops; figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm is strong, with varied sentence lengths and vivid specificity ("gut-sealed pig bladders dyed with seaweed ink"). No loops or paraphrase stalls. Information density is high; nearly every line advances world, character, or pressure. Minor figurative density: "making a hush of steps," "isobars," "throat sang" cluster in mid-section but remain legible. "Elsewheres" (line 3) is a slight lexical invention that fits voice. Clarity remains high throughout; no scaffolding or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lyric and compressed, with high information density and purposeful rhythm. Metaphors are vivid ("sleeping eel," "stilts of memory") and grammatically clean. Two issues: (1) Paraphrase loop appears ("Outside, ivy tapped… recalling how seasons now moved" / "Outside, gulls hacked the wind"), a minor −0.2 deduction. (2) Figurative density is high throughout without sharp alternation with plain statement, risking overwriting in a high-pressure beat (the hopscotch sequence), −0.3. Sentence openings vary and no scaffold or template cadence is present.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally, information density is high, and figurative language is controlled and lyric-legible ("narrow as a thread of rain," "borrowed the moment's sigh"). Two paraphrase loops: the "borrowed heartbeat" phrasing recurs six times across the text without always adding new pressure, and "perceptively calm" appears identically twice. Template cadence in the mirror-instruction sequence ("the tune of stay… the measure of if… the sudden drop of unless") reads as list rather than propulsion. No loops touch the closure beat, so the deduction remains moderate; prism/color/harmony motifs are pattern-taught and paid off, avoiding forced recurrence penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: many lines do double work (setting, interiority, theme). Two frictions lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop—"We began with names, and we stayed with names. Each name was a stone, each grief a hand remembering heat"—restates without new pressure (−0.2). (2) Template cadence in the mid-section: runs of "The [noun] [verb]" and "I [verb]" stems flatten propulsion across 4–5 lines (−0.4). Figurative language is mostly clear ("banners... lifted and sighed," "patient arcs") but "kelp into ordered swales" and "lanterns shook like small moons" verge on mixed vehicles. No severe loops or filter-verb stacks. Grammar and punctuation are clean; tense is consistent. Closure beats are artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("He spread a tarp and opened a map drawn by cracks in dried riverbeds" establishes action, object, and metaphor). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the ritual. Minor paraphrase loop: "thunder paused" echoed by "breathing pause" within two lines. A few figurative clusters in the middle third ("corridors need music to stay," "fingerprints like brittle lace") approach density ceiling but remain legible. No major scaffold or template cadence; clarity holds at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the piece: "bodily poetic" appears three times, "alarming serenity" four times, "between sigh and smile" four times, "harvest of echoes" four times, "silver courtyard under snow" three times, "prism sanctuary under starlight" four times, "to defy the lullaby of conformity" three times, "by untangling threads" three times. Synonym churn includes "threads" / "lines," "unlock" / "opened," and near-identical constructions ("She had come," "She knew," "She had learned," "She lifted," "She set," "She cupped"). Figurative language is dense but often mixed: "lanterns bled tiny suns" then "marble veins," "slow fire" for snow, "breath wrote fog" on brick. These artifacts cluster throughout, including the final third, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−1.4 baseline, −1.7 due to closure-beat presence) and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative density is high and coherent within its lyric mode, but several metaphors stack without payoff: "half-lit epiphanies rose like smoke that forgot its fire" is evocative yet obscure, and "meteor hush purling" mixes registers (astronomical + textile verb). Paraphrase loop: "Letters came easily…yet the letters I needed tonight were not for display but for removing my fingerprints" restates the ethical turn without adding pressure. Template cadence: "We would invite…to hold the stick, to decide…to cut scenes…and to tie new ones" runs parallel stems across four clauses. Sentence openings vary, but information density drops in the middle third where reflection dominates without micro-choices to anchor it. Line-level clarity is maintained, but momentum sags under decorative phrasing in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high in signal-building beats (triangle reeds, balanced pebbles, fern-stem heartbeat). However, paraphrase loops appear: "blushing stillness" recurs in paragraph 1 and 16 without added pressure; "transiently rooted" appears three times as a label rather than evolving constraint. Template cadence in exposition ("I thought of," "I told myself," "I promised aloud") across adjacent paragraphs triggers −0.4. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "burned syllable of orange" and "dullness turned oracle" work, though concentration in lyric mode risks overwriting in some readers' eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density; nearly every line advances craft action or reweights the forgiveness motif. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language is controlled ("brief roses," "aurora fell exactly where the wax waited"). Minor scaffold: "I set the crucible in its cradle and laughed once, the kind of laugh that..." meta-explains the laugh rather than trusting image. A few template cadences in the middle third ("I moved the braids again and the skylight narrowed..."). No paraphrase loops or clarity-breaking artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high ("the wafer crumbles between my fingertips, a communion of obsolete authority and my own hunger"), with sentences doing multiple jobs. However, several lines in the middle third drift toward overwriting: "ethereal grit: polishing ghosts, weighing rumors, soldering meaning to broken instructions" stacks metaphors without clear physical grounding, and "the path that wants me yawns open under my ribs" mixes body with abstraction. Template cadence appears in the final third: "I thread the reels, whisper the dream-syllables, and the archive, delighted, remembers…" then "I close my eyes and reach through interpreted dreams, and the path…" then "I set my palm against it, and feel the directive…" (three adjacent "I [verb], and…" constructions). These patterns dull momentum slightly but do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with most sentences doing double work (e.g., "Numbers became corridors, and corridors became a vow" advances both the tile's function and thematic charge). Sentence openings vary naturally and rhythm modulates with pressure: short declaratives at the vow ("I pledged oil…hours…"), longer accretive syntax during exploration. Two minor line-level frictions: "a dusky harmony like violet silk torn to ribbons" stacks modifiers in a way that slightly risks opacity, and "Attention is a currency dearer than silver, yet it costs a patient body to pay" reads as aphoristic scaffold that could be tightened. No loops, scaffold runs, or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is lyric and image-dense with strong figurative control ("spine learned to quarrel," "door learning it was always a window," "belts carry breath instead of blame"). Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm supports the accumulative lens. However, overwriting and metaphor density approach saturation: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats carries figurative language without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, triggering −0.5. Paraphrase loops appear: "shifting grace" is explained multiple times across paragraphs without added pressure (−0.2). Minor register drift into abstract diction ("cellular memory," "arithmetic of absences") in peak beats feels slightly elevated beyond the narrator's otherwise grounded voice (−0.3). Information density is high, but figurative muddle in the climactic beat ("walls lengthen into halls of childhood, floors ripple into puddles once jumped") blurs spatial clarity. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality; rounding strict.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor stakes and closure image effectively. Figurative density is high throughout: "frost lay like quiet ash," "mirrors sang like knives," "dream shouldered beside them," "fog kept a seam bright as glass mountains." In high-pressure beats (corridor wobbling, dream thrashing), metaphor accumulates without rest—"stars flickered in its ribs like trapped bees," "mirrors tasting their own fear of shatter"—risking opacity and overwriting (−0.5 for density without breathing room). Template cadence in final third: "They spoke... the fog thinned... they stepped... Ilen lifted... He offered..." (−0.4). Some paraphrase loops: "The dream recognized its cradle, not as prison, but as path" closely echoes the prior "work was not to trap, but to teach holding" (−0.2). No grammar errors; tense and aspect are stable. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, action, or theme—but the lyric overlay occasionally slows propulsion. Sentence openings vary until the final sequence. No filter-verb stacks that break immediacy, but accumulated artifacts lower the grade moderately.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies ("We mapped the stress lines… tracing where sap slurred and where fruit weighted decisions") and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Opening and closing images charge the arc. Minor loop: "vows" recurs across several adjacent lines in the middle third ("vows, I said," "old promises," "deciduous vows," "spent oaths") without always advancing new pressure—acceptable in a lyric mode but still a slight density slip. Stock metaphor in "ribs" (rafters as ribs) and "heart" (implicit) appears once but does not obscure. One filter-verb stack ("I told her," "she said," "I answered") in dialogue beats is voice-motivated and minimal. No major artifacts touch closure. The final paragraph's explanatory clauses ("because some economies…," "because sometimes a father…") are clear but slightly tell-heavy, preventing 8.5+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, world logic, or the curator's inquiry—but several phrases loop conceptually: "brightened disquiet" appears three times, "simply complicated" twice, and "the between" recurs without evolving meaning. Template stems such as "He [verb]" and "She [verb]" appear in clusters. Mixed metaphors are minimal, but the final paragraph's "pages that keep writing us as we read them" edges into overt meta-commentary. Paraphrase loops around the cameo and aunt's inquiry reduce propulsion in mid-story beats.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout with most sentences carrying metaphor ("dust and unread melodies," "ink hardens," "air thinned and spines grew blank"), creating a sustained lyric texture but also slowing propulsion in peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "rescue missions" is restated three times across paragraphs without added pressure; "gaps" and "absences" cycle through adjacent lines. Template cadence emerges in the middle third with repeated "I [verb]" stems across four consecutive sentences. The overwriting reduces clarity at the apprentice-rescue beat, where "conjugations like ladders" and "tenses as handholds" stack without concrete action. No severe artifact touches the closure directly, but cumulative density and loops flatten momentum, triggering −0.8 in Q7 for non-closure accumulation and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative density pervades nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats (final third): "bruise-colored circle of hush," "garden leaned in to listen, a shoreline bending its ear," "unkindled solace woke like dawnfire." While poetic, the stacked metaphors obscure immediate causality and dull propulsion; the reader must decode vehicle logic (how leaves "spelt nothing") rather than tracking concrete action. Synonym churn appears in adjacent lines: "trapped freedom" repeats; "recapture," "discoverer," "chimera twin" cycle without advancing new information. Paraphrase loops: "As memories alter" opens three separate paragraphs, restating temporal fluidity without added detail. Template cadence: several beats open "I [verb]" across successive sentences. Applying patterned-artifact penalties (−0.6 for density in final beats, −0.4 for loops, −0.4 for template stems) and the final-third artifact presence triggers the global 9+ disallowance and caps high-band entries at 8.8. No egregious grammar breaks; punctuation is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with many lines doing double duty (e.g., "He sensed that stories had become detached, a torn braid of campus history fluttering near the chimes"). Clarity remains strong through complex action sequences. Two friction points lower the score: (1) Minor template cadence in the middle third ("He could do it…," "He loosened…," "He brought…") across three consecutive paragraphs. (2) The phrase "the doorway, listening, slid wider" personifies the doorway in a way that slightly muddies the causal mechanics. Overall propulsion is smooth, but these small artifacts prevent entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character stance, or the planting action. Figurative language is dense but coherent—"patient breathing," "wandering faults," "letters hammered by voices," "bloom of hush"—and the vehicles remain internally consistent. Rhythm varies purposefully with longer lyric constructions in setup and tighter beats during the planting sequence. Minor scaffold appears in runs of similar stems ("I learned," "I told them," "I marked") that read template-adjacent, applying −0.3 in Q7 but not touching the closure beat. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; clarity remains high throughout. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reconfigure the premise cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is lyric and controlled, with varied sentence structure and high information density. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("prayer-soldered struts," "misted geometry," "thistle-blown hope"). However, several beats approach overwriting: "dew suspended on spider silk," "winds that sounded like scissors being cleaned," and "the sound that coincidences make when meaning opens" stack metaphor without clear tactical need. Template stems recur ("I was," "I saw," "I told," "We trimmed," "We taught") across multiple beats, creating mild cadence drag. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the communal arrival ("By morning the dunes shook with feet"), softening propulsion. No loops or causality breaks, but figurative density in peak beats triggers −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully, and paragraph structure modulates with emotional beats. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the middle third without clear propulsion, creating local density drag (e.g., "atlas where every meridian curved," "coat…pocket where my name might survive the laundry"). Two instances of adjacent paraphrase ("I wanted to sculpt identity" / "Yet every draft sounded like an echo") and template stems ("I set…I remembered…I stepped") cluster in the final third. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum slightly. No loops touch the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("moonflowers and trumpet vine, their blooms opened wide like listening mouths"), but the final third crosses into overwriting: nearly every sentence in the fireworks sequence carries metaphor without pattern-teaching or escalation. "Flame walked the cord, polite as a messenger" and "seeds of ash...fertile soot" stack vehicles without clear propulsion. Template cadence appears in the setup beats: "We walked...We mixed...We braided...By the time..." creates a rhythmic sameness. Paraphrase loop: "I came to defy the gravity of hopelessness" and later "how to lean out of sorrow without falling" restate the same premise. Apply −0.6 for density in peak beats and −0.4 for template cadence, total −1.0 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates with reflection without sluggishness. Information density is high (most lines advance character stance or charge metaphor). Minor scaffold appears: "You were asking whether I would go inland" summarizes rather than dramatizing the question, and "I wanted you to know I was not delaying, I was listening to time" explains instead of showing. Paraphrase loop in "Tide ebbing, tide turning, you and I poised on the ledge between versions" / "transition periods, the moments when identities trade languages"—the same idea restated. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor: "laugh fester" (laughter typically doesn't fester, resentment does). No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Final line propels without overwriting. Apply −0.6 for scaffold and loop presence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies with vivid, specific images—"bells loosen from steeples and float past like dandelion seeds," "silence that hovers before a kiss, which tastes of mint left in pockets." Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the collection catalogue. Two text-pattern issues reduce the score: (1) repeated "there is the silence" stems across the catalogue middle (functional parallelism but edges toward template cadence), and (2) phrase "limiting exposure" appears twice within three paragraphs without reweighting. Opening and closing lines are strong anchors. No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm and texture are strong, with varied sentence lengths and purposeful compression. Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or thematic layering. However, several lines loop or restate without added pressure: "I do this to teach silence how to comfort, to make the sounding void an ally" versus later "I try to build with cables and altitude and listening, a hush that makes a room of the gap" recycles the same concept. The phrase "in the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" appears verbatim three times as a refrain, which is pattern-taught but borders on redundancy without sufficient reweighting each time. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "logic dreaming of color" and "cable were a cradle" work without mixed metaphors. Apply paraphrase-loop and template-cadence penalties: −0.6 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence openings, high information density ("trees wired to the broken dome, pears glowing with unsent messages, and the air sweet with stored summer"), and purposeful rhythm shifts ("We descended while the waterfall sang old jingles, and the apples above pinged softly like metronomes, urging balance over speed, caution over fear"). Clarity is maintained through complex description. Three slips: (1) Paraphrase loop in paragraph 14: "the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals, the path would declare itself like a recovered password" is restated in paragraph 20 as "through the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals they would keep refining"—the repetition reads as scaffold rather than motif. (2) Mixed metaphor: "dawn fingertipped the dome" personifies dawn as hand, but "fingertipped" is not standard usage and the vehicle wobbles. (3) Template cadence in paragraphs 23–26: four consecutive paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "I [verb]," flattening rhythm at a high-pressure beat. These issues lower momentum slightly but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is image-dense and rhythmically controlled, with strong propulsion through the lesson sequence. However, several lines approach overwriting: "the loaded emptiness, which weighed enough to ground us, but left room for a bird to land" stacks metaphors without clear vehicle coherence. "I clarified" and "I told the shapes" filter key moments that could carry more immediacy. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("I kept my gaze on her," "I kept watch"). The closure beat is clean, but density in the middle third occasionally blurs causality.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, opening with lush accumulative texture ("blue caps breathe like tidepools") and tightening under crisis ("Turn the chamber ninety degrees...I wheel the steel drum"). Information density high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and pressure without padding. Minor overwriting cluster mid-story: "The bolt fits a threaded mouth at the base of the gauge tree, a strange omitted anchor. No manual mentions it, but the metal knows the ritual of pressure like an old hymn. I screw it in, feeling oceans pretend to return"—three consecutive metaphoric constructions in a high-pressure beat risk slight opacity (−0.4). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Clarity sustained through closure; final line ("The promise hums, and we keep walking") propels without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, revelation, or stance. Sentence openings vary purposefully, and figurative language ("letters drifting from open books," "standing waves") remains coherent and specific. Minor template-cadence slip in the middle third: several sentences open with participial constructions ("dimmed," "placed," "set," "closed") within a short span, creating brief rhythmic monotony. No paraphrase loops, and the strategic telling that compresses the protagonist's winter decree increases momentum. Propulsion is strong through the revelation sequence, though the density of metaphor in consecutive lines ("bridge of intuition," "questions wearing boots of grief") approaches overwriting without quite crossing the line.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout, occasionally bordering on overwriting: "constellations that had learned to root," "sink of mercury sap," "stitched constellations," "geometry...treason if they dared to measure." Most metaphors hold, but "flocked like velvet" and "allegiance...to a compass drawn in sap" verge on mixed vehicle logic. Information density is strong—most lines do multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the final line ("possibility settle into him like a homecoming") lands cleanly. Deduction for elevated-register drift in peak beats and some figurative overreach that slightly obscures immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; sentences layer action, image, and inference. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives in discovery beats, longer sentences in reflection). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity is strong. Minor overwriting: "talc-gray air," "grit of rooms," "dust spoke across the powder like gentle italics"—metaphoric density in adjacent lines without pattern-teaching. Stock phrase: "hospital of paper and sighs" in the opener. Filter verbs ("I recognized," "I imagined") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Figurative language is mostly functional but occasionally decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries a consistent lyric texture with vivid figurative language ("puddles...threw back a sly sky," "moths...spelled...the stubborn grammar"). However, metaphor density in high-pressure beats approaches oversaturation without pattern-teaching payoff, and several vehicles mix or contradict ("islands resurfacing after a tide cruelly withdrawn" blurs agency). Template cadence appears in the final third: multiple sentences beginning with declarative subject-verb pairs ("She would not be," "And if the guard," "That would be true") create rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops occur ("carefully resourceful" restated as "folding risk into routine"), and the closure beat's figurative pile-up ("the hinge, the turn, the steady hum") dilutes rather than sharpens the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences layer atmosphere, action, and thematic weight. Rhythm varies without mechanical patterning, and figurative language (tide-to-tide, salt in a rainstorm, loosens like thread) is coherent and voice-motivated. Two minor frictions: "the same ache that the rock carries from tide to tide" is a metaphor whose tenor is slightly unclear in context, and the phrase "the nerve of prophecy teased but never gratified" approaches overwriting without payoff. Sentence openings vary well, and the final image propels. No loops or scaffold, and syntactic control remains strong under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("roots braided into cloud," "stippling the air"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "tiny monuments to forgotten things" recurs three times with minimal variation, and the phrase "emerges transformed always" is repeated verbatim without added pressure. Template cadence is present in multiple "I [verb]" stems across consecutive sentences. These artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce information density. No major clarity breaks, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap holds the penalty to −0.8 for loops and stems.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with short beats during search and longer, immersive lines in the waterfall chamber. Information density is high: most sentences advance discovery, setting, or theme. Clarity remains strong despite compression. Minor penalties: "stubborn watch spring" and "the compass rose bloomed with miniature constellations, each point folding like an eyelid" mix vehicle logic slightly; "journey" and "heart" metaphors recur across several lines without full differentiation. Template cadence appears briefly in mid-section transitions ("I [verb]" stems in lines 9–12). These artifacts are non-closure and contained, triggering −0.6 total within Q7. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Final line propels cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (establish world rules, advance grief calculus, charge motifs). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the testing sequence and breathing at the furnace door. Minor template cadence appears in paragraphs 21–23: three consecutive "I [verb]" openers without taught pattern. One paraphrase loop: paragraphs 12–13 restate the name-weight discovery. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "memory that has learned to redeem itself" in the final line edges toward abstraction. Apply −0.6 for template run and loop, but closure image remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("voices live after bodies forget them," "sound grew legs"), but several vehicles strain: "light wearing her name until it could let her go" conflates metaphor logic, and "the sun scattered coins of heat that pretended they were just another cloud" introduces simultaneity and mixed agency without clear payoff. Repetitive sentence stems appear ("I listened," "I told her," "I pressed," "I stood," "I gathered") across the middle third, creating template cadence. Information density is strong—most lines do thematic and atmospheric work—but paraphrase loops occur: "laughter is a bridge" is restated as "laughter is a key that unlocks the room" within four paragraphs, synonym churn without added pressure. No filter-verb stacks or therapy-speak appear. Rhythm varies, though the consistent ~20-word sentence length flattens propulsion during the peak beat (woman's laughter climbing the ladder).

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the opening third ("proprioceptively enhanced," "survival via muscle flinch and breath timing"). However, the middle section contains minor paraphrase loops ("I remember the room… I remember the lie") and template-adjacent stems ("The forest is… I am… They brought me… I write… I follow… I leave"). The figurative density in peak beats ("leaves like applause shared by beings who photosynthesize regret") occasionally elevates register beyond immediate physical pressure. Clarity and propulsion remain intact, but scaffold patterns recur enough to prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift across the piece. Information density is high in the lens-painting sequence ("Letters rose like fish, shy, silver"). Minor loop present: "eternal instant" appears twice with similar phrasing in the final third without added pressure, triggering −0.2. Template cadence runs in the middle third ("I spoke...I tasted...I asked...I leaned") across four lines, applying −0.4. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "absence were a harbor" is fresh, though "beacon humming without sound" verges on oxymoron without clarifying payoff. No grammar or continuity breaks. Clarity remains high; propulsion is steady if occasionally slowed by descriptive layering.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high (most lines advance discovery or charge imagery), and rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives ("I waited") against longer lyric unfurlings. Clarity holds; no pronoun confusion or impossible choreography. Penalties: light paraphrase loop ("The ghosts did not wail; they waited" after "pooling like breath" / "ripple the dust"); "crumbs into little constellations" and "chorus of afternoons" touch decorative in a high-pressure discovery beat; the phrase "when the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" appears verbatim twice (beginning and end) without pattern-teaching that charges the reprise—it reads scaffold rather than motif. These issues remain non-closure (the final image is clean) so cap deduction at −0.8 total per the accumulation rule.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance image, pressure, or knowledge. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("cloud sea," "glass apples and tomes," "patient teeth"). Minor loop issues: "rustling awakenings" appears verbatim across three or more beats without variation, triggering a template-cadence penalty (~−0.4). A few near-paraprase pairs ("the whisper pressed...It breathed a memory" / "She had wanted...and forever had punished") add slight redundancy. No filter-verb stacks or major register drift. The final image ("The glass orchard library was floating...") reprises the opening with earned calm.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Sentence rhythm varies effectively ("We stood...and the minutes rained"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting in metaphor density ("lacquer touched by flame," "clockwork grapes," "sleeping swans") clusters in the first third but does not obscure causality or dull closure. Figurative language is coherent within the baroque register. The final beat ("sorrow shone, burnished") is concise and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual cadence without algorithmic drumbeat. Information density is high: most lines advance stakes, atmosphere, and character simultaneously. Minor deductions: a few near-paraphrases ("mending what isn't torn" recurs five times; the concept earns thematic weight but two instances feel more scaffolding than pressure) and one filter-verb run in the opening third ("They said the theft began...my knuckles to rain") that slightly dulls immediacy. The closure beat is clean and propulsive, so non-closure slips cap at −0.5 total.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "I knew the factory pumped the aquifer...the lagoon restored itself like a lung taking back air" anchors backstory, world logic, and present condition in one move). Rhythm varies purposefully—long contemplative sentences alternate with short declaratives at turns. Minor phrase echo: "hinged awakenings" recurs three times, acceptable as taught motif but near the loop threshold. One small scaffold: "I came to find the place where explanations fail, and it stands before me" slightly restates the opening without adding pressure. No major artifacts touch the closure image; specificity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and many lines carry double duty—"Tonight, thunder silhouettes the old causeway" anchors setting and raises stakes. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "threaded needles," "turbine-hum," "mortises finding tenons in air." Two issues lower the score: paraphrase loops appear ("I tell the archway…I tell the sea…") and template cadence in the construction sequence ("Grandmother's silhouette shows me…the future girl marks…"). Register drifts slightly elevated in peak beats ("timewoven alliances," "scaffold complexity"). Clarity remains high, but momentum sags mid-construction.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in sensory anchors (cloves, iron, trumpet flowers). Two frictions: "dawning hush" appears five times, creating mild template echo; several lines loop conceptually ("Night, I thought, is not the opposite of day but a careful engraving" / "night blooming…was not rebellion but courtship"). Figurative language is dense but coherent (pollens, beads, gloved hands). No hard clarity breaks. Propulsion slows in the middle montage (spring–summer panels) where summary replaces scene.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, alternating longer lyric lines with crisp declaratives ("I kneel"; "She is a retired clerk"). Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances image, stake, or mystical mechanics. Minor loop detected: "the diary I already carry, because here time is a circular affidavit" restates circularity without added pressure. Figurative language is dense ("hush swells like a gavel lifted above sea," "pens hover like gulls starving") but mostly coherent; one mixed vehicle: "kelp coil like a ribbon pinned to courage" awkwardly conflates physical and abstract. No template cadence or scaffold. Pronoun references stay clear across mystical layers. Elevated diction fits the archival voice but risks distancing at peak visceral moments ("scalds" could be more embodied).

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Clarity is strong; no causality-breaking loops. However, several phrases repeat conceptual content without added pressure: "rejects false comfort" appears twice, "the amber bottle with no opening" recurs identically, and "prices must first exist" is both stated and immediately echoed by "future children arguing about prices." Template-cadence check: "She lit...She ground...She wrote...She set" in the middle third approaches mechanical parallel without taught pattern. Figurative language is vivid ("faded thoughts," "ghost town revival only if the living learn their lines") but occasionally dense without payoff ("the air thickened with plausible futures"). No major artifacts touch closure. Minor filter-verb density in reflective passages ("she reminded herself," "she heard").

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically dense, with strong specificity ("wax cylinder phonograph shaving," "frostbitten Greek," "quinces small and green as bruises"). Sentence openings vary and paragraph structure supports accumulation. Key friction: several lines loop or paraphrase without advancing pressure—"To archive emotional patterns, I must refuse to become their victim, yet their story lifts inside me" repeats the tension stated earlier; "Every archive is a house of careful hauntings, yet this one is different" is conceptual summary rather than scene action. The phrase "I record with my stylus on the parchment, mapping stains, the pauses between words" describes process we've already inferred. Figurative density is high throughout, occasionally blurring clarity ("residue so fine it refused sweeping" is lovely but imprecise about what the residue does in the ritual). No template cadence or filter-verb stacks, but the accumulation of near-synonyms for ritual action ("murmur," "hum," "speak," "listen") across adjacent beats creates mild redundancy. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and conceptual summary in non-closure beats; −0.3 for register drift on "velvet disquiet."

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level clarity is high, rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is strong in most beats. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats borders on overwriting: "creature of seeds unfurls until it becomes a memory engine, its veins braided with veins of frost" stacks metaphors without clear causal linkage. Minor paraphrase loop: "I want not to own them but to feel their nap and grain, to discover the texture of borrowed time, then pass through" restates the motivation already clear from prior lines. No scaffold or template cadence; grammar and punctuation are clean. The seasons passage compresses transit efficiently, a positive. Textural specificity ("amaranth skulls," "beans that remember summer handshakes") elevates precision.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic modulation without algorithmic patterning. Information density is high—most lines advance character stance, atmospheric pressure, or thematic resonance. Minor figurative density in some beats ("cathedral bell rope dangled beside the console, a woven vein"; "clouds trudged like tired pilgrims") approaches decorative clustering, though vehicles remain coherent and voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops, template cadence, or filter-verb stacks; scaffold is minimal. Grammar and punctuation are clean; pronoun references track across the cast. Occasional elevated phrasing ("intangible hinge where fear becomes guidance") stays legible within the established voice but flirts with the upper edge of the narrator's natural register.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual variety. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (advance character stance, world texture, thematic charge). Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. However, figurative language appears in most sentences throughout, and some vehicles edge toward mixed or overreached metaphor: "the sky murmured to my bucket" is evocative but slightly opaque; "the night could pass through and teach me its shoreline" stacks abstractions. Peak beats (power failure, final roof-opening) maintain clarity, so the overwriting does not obscure closure, but the sustained density of metaphor across the entire text creates occasional line-level friction where a more concrete anchor would sharpen impact. No scaffold or boilerplate; grammar and punctuation are clean. Applying density overwriting penalty: −0.4 for figurative saturation without pattern-teaching, mitigated by the fact that closure beats remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density and purposeful figuration: "colors spilled from the glass and mapped pilgrim paths on dust" does triple work (setting, motif, ghost movement). Rhythm modulates well—lyric expansion in ritual beats, compression at the queen's arrival. Deductions: paraphrase loop between "He never touched their translucent hands, but each day he felt less alone" and the earlier "gathered, not to speak, but to gaze"; template cadence in consecutive "He [verb]" stems across several paragraphs (carried, placed, kept, read, met); filter-verb cluster in final third ("He understood, through contextual clues," "He could almost hear") that slightly dulls immediacy. The figurative load is high but mostly coherent and voice-motivated, though "pain threaded the present to the archive, knitting a path" mixes metaphors (thread vs. knit). No loops obscure closure; the hexagon sigil and blue stripe land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character stance, or world logic. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("rivered," "time capsule breathed like a patient animal") clarifies rather than obscures. However, paraphrase loops appear: "understand the texture of time passing" is restated across three paragraphs without added pressure, and "damaged time capsule" receives near-synonym churn ("split seal," "gnawed hinge," "smeared inscriptions") in adjacent lines. These artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce propulsion slightly, triggering a −0.4 deduction under the loop-check rule.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("lacquered leaves," "a bright fish of air," "tide math")—creating cumulative lushness that occasionally slows momentum. In peak beats (the boy's grief, the raft's floating), the language remains purposeful, but phrases like "the small raft meant only to carry attention" and "giving it neighbors that hear its key" tip toward overwriting without pattern-teaching. No paraphrase loops or template cadence appear, and sentence structures vary. Proofreading is clean. The ornamental load in non-peak beats (e.g., "a bell, rung to draw the grief into the open air") applies modest line-level drag; the closure beat ("lets the ink say less than silence can") remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance setting, character, or thematic accumulation. Rhythm varies purposefully, modulating from task-list brevity ("I walked the rows and listened") to lyric expansion ("the brazen calm inside me widened"). Two minor artifacts: "The hum was not pain; it was appetite" and "silence arrived not as absence but as trust" use negation-inversion constructions that echo each other, a template-cadence slip. Filter verbs ("I learned," "I knew," "I believed") cluster in the first third but anchor reflection to present stimuli, satisfying BRR. No loops or synonym churn touch the closure beat. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies well; sentence openings shift. High information density: most lines advance both ritual action and metaphor. The amber-skylight-basin sequence is propulsive and clear. Minor loop: "converge" appears in adjacent sentences ("began to converge," "convergence happened sideways") without added meaning—paraphrase-loop penalty −0.2. "Bronze quiet" recurs without staleness. One filter-verb stack in the window paragraph ("thought," "imagined," "understood") slightly dulls immediacy under peak pressure. No template cadence or register drift. Figurative language is dense but coherent; "chemistry of homecoming" and "rate constant" are coined terms that risk abstraction yet remain anchored by amber, scent, pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("narrow vastness," "small thunder promising leaf," "margin for fragrance"). Several metaphors strain or layer without sharpening sense: "harbor smooth as weed," "soldiers of dill, fleets of poppies," "battlefield unlaces under green." Template stems recur ("He [verb]" x7 in quick succession mid-piece), creating a drumbeat that flattens momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "submerged concord" is named three times with minimal reweighting until the end. Information density is high but some lines do decorative work rather than advance pressure. Closure image is clean; line-level artifacts do not touch it directly but accumulate enough to prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with vivid, purposeful detail: "bloodhound retired from finding bodies," "copper teeth for a phonograph," "scarecrow of rebar and twine with a copper crow for a head." Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor figurative density in early paragraphs (homes welded from rib cages, gust like a door learning to breathe) borders on overwriting but remains coherent and voice-motivated, so no penalty. One small opacity: "letters rose like minnows where the wax cast its thin river onto the grooves" requires a second parse but clarifies within context. Propulsion is steady; no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes with charged images. Information density is high—most lines layer description, interiority, and thematic weight. Minor deductions: "echoed silence" recurs four times across opening and closing without added pressure; a few figurative vehicles stack densely in mid-passage ("petals unfolding too slowly to believe," "patient animal," "flowered from the sun") risking coherence under speed-read. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; grammar and tense are clean. Propulsion is lyric-accumulative rather than causal, appropriate to the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("thawwater leaving a tight throat," "lantern with wet wick"), but the metaphor frequency in high-pressure beats—especially the chess-swap sequence—risks overwriting without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure; apply −0.4 for density without full integration. Some phrases loop conceptually: "trembled" / "shook," "breath" / "sigh" / "exhale," and "swapped" echoes across six beats without fresh variation. Sentence openings vary well, and no paraphrase loops appear. The final paragraph shifts to dialogue and summary, flattening the closure image's propulsion slightly. Information density is high, but the figurative load in the middle third slows momentum when urgency is signaled.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "A lantern cut a halo along the cornice, and the room grew a nomadic penumbra that drifted with our breath" anchors light, introduces the central motif, and ties it to collective presence). Opening and closing lines charge the frame effectively. However, minor scaffold appears: "I was benevolently ruthless" and "I was ruthless about detail and benevolent about motive" loop the same concept across distant beats without adding pressure, and the phrase "nomadic penumbra" recurs seven times, sometimes decoratively. A few constructions edge toward overwriting—"It was like the shadow of a tent that walks even when we rest" extends a metaphor without clarifying stakes—and the penultimate paragraph's "asking if the board wanted a king" anthropomorphizes the object in a way that softens rather than sharpens the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent: "ivy made of pages," "dictionaries muttered," "loaves of night." However, overwriting clusters in several beats—"mercury in her eyes stilled, reflecting a clean horizon," "seed like a sky before rain, the air pregnant with possibility"—where metaphor stacks without advancing pressure (-0.5). Paraphrase loop appears: "I would seed my tongue... seed my steps... seed the mountain" repeats the seed construction across three lines without variation (-0.2). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Information density is generally high, though some lines ("hidden thunder traveled through the stacks, and a shelf shifted, sighing its assent") add texture without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("exile curl tight around my throat," "weave where decisions hold and break"). Slight overwriting in mid-section: "fierce repose," "woven hush became a breathing hush," and "dust rose as if listening" cluster without adding causal pressure, trending toward decorative accumulation (−0.3). The storm "rolled without rolling, a held drumbeat" borders on mixed metaphor but recovers through paradox. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density is strong; most lines advance image, memory, or choice. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reconfigure prior motifs effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly coherent ("needle the clouds forgot to remove," "human weather of trying"). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or pressure. Two patterns reduce momentum: paraphrase loops in the backstory block ("He had painted a dawn… he had not paid, and the debt pulsed") restate guilt without added pressure (−0.3). Template cadence in the color-giving sequence ("Give a blue… a red… a green") is voice-motivated by the canyon but borders on mechanical (−0.2). No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. Clarity remains high; no muddy metaphors touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances image, choice, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sustained ("the sea gnaws," "wind threads the machine") but stays coherent and voice-motivated, not ornamental. Minor loop: "The seam is not apology, it is a declaration" / "Her absence is a diagram" risk synonym churn in the middle third, and the phrase "Time here is counted between breaths held underwater, when I duck my head into the cooling cistern to spare my lungs" is mildly circuitous. No sentence-stem templates; rhythm varies purposefully. Clarity at closure is pristine ("the bells agree with a weary concord").

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, information density is high ("I walk by the beam of a lantern and the softer glow of the painted shell cupped in my palm"). Figurative language is purposeful and mostly coherent, though "temporary eternity" recurs frequently enough to risk becoming a refrain rather than image. A few constructions lean ornate without muddling sense: "the pool quivers like soft glass forgetting itself and then remembering" works, but the density of metaphor in adjacent lines ("liquid seams," "corridor of light," "tides that painted themselves") occasionally compresses clarity in the middle third. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; the final image propels without waste. The piece narrowly avoids overwriting by tethering each figure to concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("the sea is a crowded city," "gratitude needs a crossing guard"). However, several lines paraphrase without advancing pressure: "Then I can tune my voice" after "my breath steadies" and "I will answer not with thunder, but with a gentle map of breath" echoes earlier phrasing. Template cadence appears in the repeated "I [verb]" stems across multiple paragraphs. Minor synonym churn ("whisper" vs. "hum" vs. "beckon") is functional, but cumulative loops dull momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: most lines layer action, memory, and atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "After the flood, after the evacuation, after the hydraulics fail" is echoed by "I think of the hydraulics fail on the ferry, how the engine coughed, how the wheel locked, how we waited and learned leaving"—the second restates the first without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence appears in the climactic sequence: "The sand remembers... I kneel to find... They were vowels... I set the patina bronze... The needle I carried..." (five consecutive subject-verb stems) in a high-pressure beat (−0.5). Stock metaphor "like a prayer" and "like a bird relearning sky" appear but do not obscure clarity. These artifacts do not touch the closure beat itself, limiting total deduction to −0.7. No other significant loops or muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening long clauses ("The storms had planed the ravine to a grim bowl") give way to tighter beats during the patrol encounter. Information density is high: most lines carry world-building, trait disclosure, or pressure. Two artifacts reduce the score: (1) "Truth followed me like the smell of earth, because since infection I had been involuntarily truthful" loops concept across adjacent clauses without added detail; (2) several figurative vehicles strain coherence—"laughter snagged on a throat...and we learned the shape of our fractures by the notes that cracked" mixes aural and spatial metaphors without clear tenor. No paraphrase loops in peak beats; the final paragraph avoids scaffold. Proofreading clean.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully ("She pressed the boutonniere into the notch the night he did not return, and the dock took that pain into its timber to keep it from drowning"), and information density is high throughout. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. One friction: the phrase "little chevrons where some sailor without ink had practiced sending himself home" and later "little knocks with a nail" both deploy "little" as a softening modifier in adjacent descriptive beats, creating mild textural convergence. Figurative language (opal dock, mist as ribbons) is spaced and purposeful, not stacked in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify. Information density is high: most lines serve character, pressure, or resonance. The creek and ants supply recurring motifs with evolving function. Two minor artifacts lower the score: paraphrase near "cataloging other people choosing" / "maps that ask nothing back" (slight loop), and one filter-verb cluster in the cavern beats ("I felt," "I put my ear," "I understood"). No scaffolding or template cadence. The final line ("matrix chip warmed, a small weight that aligned my steps like a compass") charges closure cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "mountains whose ribs cut the dusk," "map of dreams she had written in sleepless ink," "bruise of prophecy," "flask the color of nicked bone," "wind took on the voice of a wet veil whisked across tile." Most images are coherent, but some strain: "lacy menace of power and mercy knotted together" mixes texture (lacy) with abstraction (menace, power, mercy) without grounding. Template cadence appears: "There she met… He bowed… You are late… I am precisely…" and "If you wake her… She asked… Once, he said…" across the wanderer's scene. Paraphrase loop: "Names are doors, he said, and so are silences" followed by "she told him the name the dreams used" restates without added pressure. These artifacts do not touch the closure beat directly but accumulate to −0.8 to −1.0 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative language is dense ("juniper and doubt," "eclipse shadow," "moths that have learned metallurgy") and occasionally stacks without pattern-teaching, risking overwriting in high-pressure beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "We do not kiss; we calibrate" followed by "observation is devotion" restates stance without advancing pressure. Template stems recur ("We circle," "We hold," "We place") in the final third. Clarity remains intact but momentum suffers under decorative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.7)
    High information density with most lines doing multiple jobs ("Dreams know my name because I autograph them for a living, or a dying, whatever order I wake into"). Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Two paraphrase moments near the midpoint: "I was chronologically confused again" echoes the opening claim without adding new pressure, and the "I wrote fast...I wrote slow" couplet borders on semantic loop though it serves thematic rhythm. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one mixed vehicle ("the floor rose like a wave...buoyant as a leaf") blurs scale. No template cadence or pronoun drift. Strong propulsion overall; the loops and metaphor muddle cost −0.4 cumulatively in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines layer action, image, and theme. Figurative language (drips as vowels, timing as verb taught by water, fog swallowing sound) is frequent but coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding mixed vehicles. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor overwriting in the middle third: "I do not have smell to offer, but I can trace those minutes with him, mapping the emotional terrain he crossed" restates the established method without advancing pressure. Proofreading is clean; grammar and punctuation are controlled. The density of metaphor in contiguous lines risks opacity but remains just within legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and carries the ceremonial cadence effectively. Information density is high; nearly every line advances the rite or deepens the rune-backstory link. Clarity is strong except for minor lapses: "ink that crystallizes when stressed" is repeated verbatim at two beats without development, and "by revisiting youthful superstitions" appears twice as a near-template phrase. "The read letters settle" in the final line is a typo or artifact ("rune letters" or "written letters" was likely intended). These loops and the artifact lower the score but do not obscure closure. Figurative language is dense in places ("lungs become gates") but mostly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift, and figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Information density is strong (perfume bottle setup, metronome circuit, orchard backstory) without redundancy. Two minor artifacts: "I mistook spinning for direction" and "coastal town" metaphors in adjacent beats create slight decorative stacking, and "imperfect miracles" recurs three times without always advancing pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity remains high. The final image (nocturne "clumsy" yet "ours") is propulsive and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is controlled ("hush did not stifle; it revealed," "forecast for a civilization that never happened"), but several beats suffer from elevated register drift and near-paraphrase loops: "I arrived… bearing my only tool. A softcover dictionary… lay against my heart" repeats setup without added pressure, and "wanderingly exact" recurs as a template phrase in two separate beats without evolving meaning. The line "Read, the straps seemed to sigh, or be read by what reads you" is evocative but borders on obscuring cause-effect in a peak moment. Information density is high overall, though some philosophical turns feel restated rather than advanced.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Two artifacts reduce the score: slight overwriting in the final third (multiple metaphors per sentence without clear pattern payoff, e.g., "bell held on a palm" adjacent to "bass hush") and one paraphrase loop ("the exact moment a surface breaks" echoes prior edge/severance language without added pressure). No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Propulsion remains strong; the loop is contained and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor and resolve. Information density is high with few redundancies. Minor deductions: several lines loop conceptually ("lucid contradictions" appears three times with slightly varied phrasing; "Practice risk as stewardship, not as theater" and "widening perspectives responsibly" echo without advancing pressure). A few figurative images ("sea anemone," "scrim of advice") feel ornamental rather than propulsive in peak beats. No major scaffold or template cadence, but cumulative texture occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and varies across beats; opening lines establish a compressed, breath-like cadence that persists. Information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure). Two minor loop/scaffold issues: "cultivated estrangement" repeated across three beats with near-identical phrasing, and "melodically haunted" feels slightly formulaic in early use. The emergency sequence accelerates cleanly, and the final paragraph's accumulation ("Some nights...she would open the gate...a beginning") propels without drag. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("walnut-ink archivist," "sea thrift," "barnacles wrote their blunt alphabets," "wave a hush and a cheer") and occasionally stacks without pattern-teaching, risking overwriting in peak beats. "Proximate causes" appears in six lines, creating mild template echo. Information density is strong; most lines do multiple jobs. A paraphrase loop near mid-story ("context changes, photographs become timepieces" / "when context changes...meaning takes on habitable shape") slightly dulls momentum. No scaffold or clarity-breaking artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the final image clean.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths shift with scene pressure. Information density is high—most lines advance image, atmosphere, and thematic pattern simultaneously. Minor paraphrase loop: "The rumor spread through improbable rumor chains" repeats "rumor" within one beat without adding pressure. Stock metaphor: "hearts that had done the same" (flooded) reads conventional. Figurative density is high throughout but pattern-taught early and sustained, so no density penalty applies. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs; clarity remains strong even under compression.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative density is high but coherent: "quiet blaze banks," "glass strings humming," "planet the size of an ache." However, the piece shows paraphrase loops in the final third—lines 28–32 restate the stillpoint insight across five sentences with synonym churn ("not escape but axis," "consent to pivot," "map grows round"). Template cadence appears in the backstory block ("There is the harbor… There is the isthmus… There is the trench") without pattern payoff. These artifacts dull momentum in the closure sequence, triggering −0.6 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful and controlled: "gravity pooled and thinned in tides," "treaty within me," "terraces" as both literal and metaphorical. Sentence rhythm varies—short beats during peak pressure, longer breaths during reflection. Minor artifact: paraphrase loop in "Edit what, I asked" followed immediately by "History, he said" could compress. Another slip: "strange comfort settle, like a blanket that remembers several winters and waits" stacks metaphor without full clarity. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs (seeds, ladders). No severe template cadence or filter-verb stacks, but a few recycled stems in the middle third ("Del said," "Del tapped," "Del appeared") nudge downward within the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("tide hummed like glass," "ring through milk," "bell of unstruck light") with occasional register drift into elevated diction that strains the POV's lexicon. Several adjacent lines loop conceptually: the camera's "empty belly" and "nothing was the subject" rephrase the same idea; "coordinates" and "silence contained rhythm" repeat the mapping conceit without advancing it. Propulsion is present but slowed by synonym churn. The closure image is clear despite the density.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is frequent and sometimes vivid ("spine of stone halls," "a kiln, not a bomb"), but density in high-pressure beats obscures momentum: "seeds opened like small eyes, sprouting filaments that wrote across the floor in curling ink, linking names from portrait to mosaic to tapestry." Mixed metaphors appear ("heart steaming with volcanic tenderness"). Template cadence runs: multiple sentences open with "I [verb]" or "The [noun] [verb]" without variation. Paraphrase loops: the "trail of artistic creations leading to a hidden message" is stated in paragraph 6, then restated in paragraph 23 as "The trail of artistic creations… became a single living sentence." Synonym churn: "analytically intuitive" appears three times as a label without evolving function. These artifacts do not fully obscure closure but dull line-level propulsion and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.8 in Q7, with an additional −0.2 for convergence at the closure beat ("the seeds wrote the last names onto the wind").

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift ("They called me," "At night," "I was quietly rebellious," "Tonight I was here"). Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or ritual. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("braid tugged me toward the center," "stars lean closer, their light tasting of unread letters"). Minor overwriting in the middle third: "Every ripple was a syllable our entangled minds had not yet dared to pronounce" and "that color of becoming that hurts because it is true" veer toward elevated abstraction without full dramatic grounding. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and propulsion is strong in high-pressure beats (the whisper threading toward the quay, the gate persuasion). Information density is high: most lines do double duty (e.g., "the maze gave him back a map of tongues" conveys method and result). However, several sentences in the opening third employ ornate metaphor that slows momentum ("maps were origami logic, capable of being refolded into new corridors whenever a crane operator sneezed differently" reads decorative). The phrase "a key with no apparent lock" repeats twice without adding pressure. Minor template cadence in the middle (multiple "He [verb]" constructions). No loops or major artifacts, but figurative density in non-peak beats nudges the score down from high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: most lines do double work (e.g., "His coat held old rainbows of oil, and his eyes held every failed promise" anchors both appearance and thematic weight). Sentence openings vary and paragraph cuts create visual rhythm. Zero paraphrase loops; figurative language is coherent and controlled. Minor deduction: "spiralingly calm" recurs four times as label without syntactic variation, borderline template cadence (−0.3). The opacity of "spiralingly" itself strains clarity under peak pressure when the gesture should land most precisely. "Stillwater tension" and "half-spoken secret" front-load atmosphere effectively, and the final "alleys bent toward other harbors" extends world without stalling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and many lines do double duty ("small kings felt warm as teacups" merges image and stakes). However, pervasive figurative density in high-pressure beats ("mist curled like quiet music," "needles over true north," "breath like paper drinks light") stacks metaphors without always clarifying cause or sharpening pressure, triggering a −0.5 overwriting deduction. Paraphrase loops appear ("unspoken words" recurs five times across similar constructions), and template cadence ("I could hear…," "We…") runs through multiple paragraphs without pattern payoff, adding −0.6 for scaffold. One run of participle openers in the grotto sequence blurs action order. No artifacts touch the final beat directly, so I do not escalate penalties or disallow 9+ globally, but accumulated line debt caps this category in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.9)
    Information density is high, but figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without respite, triggering overwriting penalties: "fate came with a pocket," "fog into a staircase," "silence heavy enough to crush careful lies," "a cathedral breathing." Paraphrase loops appear: "I wanted freedom... I wanted to work... I wanted to be seen" cycles without added pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph: four consecutive "we would" constructions. Mixed metaphors: "ringing traveled up my arms, like chain singing" conflates tactile vibration with auditory image. These artifacts dull the closure beat's impact, preventing entry into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence structure shifts between lyric fragments and longer accretive moves. Information density is high ("Gratitude Transition" simultaneously names world rule, reveals tonal register, and advances plot). Minor figurative clustering in early paragraphs ("insect wings," "foal," "clock hands") without clear pattern-teaching, though it coheres with the lyric stance. One paraphrase moment: "remade hush" is restated across beats but with evolving function, so not penalized as loop. Propulsion is strong; no scaffold detected. Final line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("lantern-moth hush," "cloud-shadow poet," "ivy sips the metal for courage") but appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5). Register drifts into academic abstraction ("ethics of presence," "Conceptual Repricing") that clashes with the lyric voice in peak beats (−0.4). Paraphrase loops appear: "dissolving boundaries" is restated across multiple lines without added pressure (−0.2). Several lines are decorative rather than propulsive (e.g., "the atrium remembers its purpose" tells rather than shows). Cumulative line-level debt and elevated diction in high-pressure moments lower the score and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with lyric repetition of "after the phoenix rises" creating structural cadence. Information density is high in most beats. However, several paraphrase loops and near-duplicates appear: "beauty in imperfection" recurs without added pressure across paragraphs 4, 12, and 20; "the courtyard trees lean" and "soft chord slides out" in paragraph 18 restate sensory impressions; "phoenix rises" functions as motif but also as filler in paragraphs 1, 24, and 31. Template cadence emerges in mid-section beats with repeated "He [verb]" stems. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor: "sings with chips and waves" conflates auditory and visual-physical domains without clear bridge. The final image is strong, but line-level momentum sags in the middle third due to synonym churn around "awakening" and "imperfection." Artifact penalty: −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems; no closure-beat contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing atmosphere or stakes. However, several paraphrase loops and template stems appear: "I am here to discover," "I am the prism-song," "I will follow"; the phrase "powerfully gentle" recurs without evolving pressure. The metaphor "golden shadows" is repeated mechanically across beats. These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats but do not obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "People hired me to set grief in metal" anchors profession, tone, and thematic frame). Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift purposefully. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats. Figurative language ("curtains of intention," "lily rose on the dome") remains coherent and voice-motivated. Minor register drift: "subdued as a red star" reads slightly elevated against the plain-spoken surrounding prose, and "coordinates in the margin of my heart" edges toward poetic convenience. Clarity and propulsion stay strong; no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density (rain "stitched," light "pooling," city "sounded like coins washing") appears in most sentences of several beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalty. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but template cadence appears in stacked "She said/taught/told me" constructions across teaching beats. Information density is high; most lines advance methodology or client work. The final image's "ribbon festival" metaphor charges prior tape-work but earlier metaphoric vehicles occasionally mix (stitching rain, absorbing ink, multiplying paths) without clear coherence, applying figurative muddle deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("dust rose...atoms of nostalgia practicing breath," "mirrors...translated me into constellations of borrowed ash"). However, multiple metaphors blur physical logic: can stairs climb sideways while being a ramp pretending to be stairs? Can a ceiling be a lake remembering fire? The density approaches saturation—nearly every sentence carries metaphor—without pattern-teaching or relief. Paraphrase loops appear: "opened like a seedpod, revealing stairs" followed immediately by "took the invitation" restates acceptance. Template cadence: "I saw X, and I saw Y, I saw Z" runs across three beats without variation. Apply −0.8 in Q7 for density without breathing room plus mild figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric constructions alternating with shorter beats at climax ("Light rained from the rafters, not burning but washing"). Information density is high, but figurative language appears in most sentences—"borrowed reveries that fluttered like fragile birds," "shadow wrote looping questions on the floor," "wish forming, as if the shadow wanted to metamorphose"—creating a consistent lyric texture that occasionally obscures causal linkage. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but elevated diction in peak beats (e.g., "luminous regret," "testimonies that patience can sculpt gentler futures") drifts into abstraction. One minor clarity slip: "the stone anchored it long enough for Ilen to kneel and remember the taste of first rain" mixes memory-as-anchor with an unexplained sensory cue. Grammar and tense are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines do double duty (e.g., "He sold us confidence, and I bought it because I wanted cruelty to end" advances backstory and motive). Rhythm varies—short declaratives at peak beats, longer cadences in reflection—without template runs. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. One deduction: "I counted tinctures, counted sutures, counted the apologies" is purposeful parallelism but nears synonym churn. Minor scaffold: "Sometimes it feels alive, sometimes merely patient" adds texture without advancing pressure. Figurative language ("mist rose like counsel") remains coherent and sparse.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; figurative density is high but pattern-taught early and sustained through closure without muddle. Information density is strong: most lines advance image, character, or pressure. Minor deductions: "the air holds a meteor hush that feels stitched by long needles of light" stacks three metaphors without full integration; "the city below whispering that it too survived by miscalculation" anthropomorphizes without clear grounding. A few near-loops appear: "I did not ask for it" echoes "displaced miracle slipped," and "the plants told me / The plants murmur" recycles the same vehicle across adjacent beats. Apply −0.6 for moderate figurative density in peak beats and minor scaffold. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively with figurative density serving accumulative design: "doors ajar like vowels," "costume pressed, listening for the cue that never comes." Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The booth filled with a kind of breath, a hush that was thunder" advances atmosphere, method, and thematic echo simultaneously). Two minor issues: "hushed thunder" appears three times (opening, middle, end) with only slight variation, creating a quasi-loop rather than charged reprise; and the phrase "because that was when objects sighed the loudest" in paragraph 10 introduces a slightly precious register that doesn't recur or pay off. The final paragraph's cascade of images propels cleanly without scaffold. No major filter-verb stacks or template cadence; clarity remains high despite metaphoric load.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.1)
    Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence ("sky breathes," "unspoken words braided with frost," "marble lungs," "night repeats it in color"), creating density without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Paraphrase loops: "the instrument...a vessel for remembered stardust" / "stardust rises from their shoulders" / "the city remembers...its stardust." Template cadence in the final third: "I [verb]...I [verb]...I [verb]" across six consecutive sentences. Metaphor muddle: "marble lungs afraid of drawing breath" mixes tenor/vehicle incoherently. Artifacts touch the closure beat (−1.7 baseline, pattern pervades).

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: most lines advance image, action, and theme simultaneously ("I flip the chess clock toward it, and the hands, still speared at twelve, reflect the dunes like two blind fish"). Rhythm modulates with pressure (short commands during deployment: "I carry them to the unlit corners"). Minor figurative density in the middle third (wave functions, lattice of probability, not yet/almost) approaches ornament but remains anchored to the charm's mechanics. No loops or scaffold; propulsion is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines serve multiple functions (sensory grounding, world-building, interiority). Figurative language is purposeful and controlled: "leaves ticking like clocks," "wind threaded through the crowns," "the hum of insight braided with a faint, patient ticking." Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Minor overwriting: some metaphors cluster densely in the opening third ("engines adopt oil," "misdelivered mail," "forest's missing tooth") without pattern-teaching, though they remain coherent. One paraphrase micro-loop: "The wind through different trees was the method the forest used to teach me myself" restates the earlier method description with minimal added pressure. No scaffold or template cadence. Clarity remains intact; no loops or artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative density serves the accumulative design. However, several lines loop conceptually: "a vigil in twilight" appears twice with similar framing, and the closing metaphor stack ("light as breath and heavy as love") dilutes precision at the climax. Minor template cadence in the guides' paired speeches ("The first guide… the second guide…") and a few filter verbs under pressure ("I realize," "I feel") slightly dull immediacy. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; sentences layer action, atmosphere, and interiority without padding. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declarations at pain beats, longer syntactic waves during reflective passages). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; paragraph structure supports pressure. The metaphorical freight is heavy but legible, and most images anchor in concrete detail (wrist wrapped in wires, radiator clicks, bench bolt). Minor slip: "the unpardonable silence that guarded this place" and "it was an unpardonable silence because it pretended to protect" create near-restatement across two beats without added pressure, triggering a small loop deduction. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative density is high but uneven; some images land with precision ("ink pellet rolled, leaving a dark note across her finger") while others stack without clear propulsion ("glittered like borrowed noon," "each eyelash the law's shadow," "tears brilliant as a forfeit" in quick succession). Template cadence appears in repeated "he did not X; he Y" constructions and parallel sentence openings ("Lyr waited," "Lyr stood," "Lyr cleaned"). The phrase "regally unpretentious" recurs three times without reweighting, trending toward loop. Mixed metaphor: "dust motes spiraled as if stars rehearsing their next positions, then forgot the choreography" introduces agency (stars rehearse, forget) that clashes with the passive dust-mote vehicle. The closing beats sustain clarity and momentum, mitigating non-closure artifact penalties, but figurative muddle in early and mid-beats and synonym churn ("diminutive titan," "smallest of titans," "regally unpretentious" x3) lower the score cumulatively by −0.8 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with most lines advancing image, discovery, or conceptual weight. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and figurative language is coherent (breathing corridor, spine of dots, lanterns as hinges). However, paraphrase loops appear: "drifting moored" recurs four times, and "assembled/assemble" cycles without always adding pressure. The phrase "delayed revelation" is named rather than purely shown. Template cadence in the middle third ("I pressed," "I slowed," "I understood") reduces propulsion slightly. No major clarity breaks, but the density of metaphor in some beats (dreamed spine, vertebrae as lanterns) risks ornament over action.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, setting, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, with short declarations ("She rose") alternating with longer accumulative sentences. A few paraphrase loops: "the hum" recurs across adjacent lines without new pressure, and "awkwardly confident" is repeated verbatim. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent—"margin of daylight," "thunderous serenity," stones as stars—though "the bay breathed like a sleeping leviathan awaiting a final whisper" stacks metaphors heavily in the opener. The loop/scaffold penalty applies for "awkwardly confident" and minor synonym churn around "hum." Template cadence is avoided; sentence openings vary. No filter-verb stacks or major clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or pressure. The opening ("Steam rose…") anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent ("mirrored steam," "borrowed breath," "roots while thinking of tomorrow"). However, several lines approach overwriting: "the mince of syllables slide through cattail and scarlet moss" stacks metaphor without clear payoff, and "wet loaf" for the amber feels strained. Template cadence appears in the council-argument paragraph: "She answered that waiting was also a choice, and that intent mattered, and that implanted destiny was only tradition…" (three parallel "that" clauses). The phrase "memory of roots while thinking of tomorrow" in the kite instruction is abstract and could be sharper. No major loops, but the penultimate paragraph's density ("borrowed breath," "braid of futures," "declared map," "translate her promise") risks register drift into poetic scaffolding. Clarity holds, but figurative load in peak beats edges toward −0.4 to −0.6 range.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening lyric compression ("breathed salt and sap") shifts to grounded action ("scrubbing fog from panes"). Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (character, world, theme). The gull rescue beat propels cleanly without loops. Minor deductions: "He recognized how quietly talented she was" slightly scaffolds what the prior sentence showed. "Cut this knot, hold here, breathe" risks list cadence but the urgency justifies compression. A few figurative phrases stack in reflective beats ("memory loading like an old program, stuttering frames") without obscuring clarity. Zero major loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances image, choice, or atmosphere. Figurative language is concentrated but controlled: "hands into moths," "gulls rode the wind like commas," "light argued up the spiral." Minor density concern: a few lines in the middle third ("Who answers the Keeper's log when the Keeper is gone?") edge toward rhetorical scaffolding without immediate pressure payoff, though the pattern is voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking—"alleys hollowed like flutes," "the clock inside turned viscous," "a throne of pauses, a crown of near-misses"—but the concentration is high across most sentences, risking overwriting in a piece this compressed. Several constructions loop conceptually: "disappear" as mentor's lesson, the protagonist's learned action, the ink's property, and the final act, which charges the motif but also risks synonym churn. Line-level clarity holds in spatial moves, and information density is strong (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes), but the elevated register and stacked metaphors in consecutive beats ("levee and a bridge," "door ripples open," "memory of fear shaped into a chamber") occasionally slow propulsion. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks, but the richness borders on impeding momentum in the hut and chamber sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Pipes hissed beneath the aisles where frost furred the brass like patient moss" anchors setting, mood, and the freeze motif). Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is mostly controlled. Two deductions: the phrase "dizzying quiet" recurs five times, becoming a tonal anchor rather than a loop, but "quiet" + "silence" synonym churn appears in adjacent beats mid-story. Template cadence in the catalog passage ("The exile documented... The wife traced...") slightly flattens momentum. No loops touch the closure beat, so caps do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (world-building + character + stakes). Clarity is strong except for occasional figurative stacking: "tranquil blaze of calm" mixes registers and "honest heat" at the ending feels abstract. Minor paraphrase loop: the final paragraph recycles "weight" and "cut to make falling kinder" across two sentences without fresh pressure. No scaffold or template cadence. Proofreading clean; no grammar slips.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"waves of sound rose into hedges," "the sky bowed and pressed its brow to the harbor rim"—and while often vivid, the accumulation risks overwriting in peak beats where causal clarity would sharpen impact. Paraphrase loop detected: "I voiced that hush and the constellations turned their faces, and I heard the goddess not as thunder but as the promise before thunder" closely restates "Her echo slid into focus" without advancing pressure. Template cadence surfaces in the middle third with repeated "I [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems. No major clarity breaks, but momentum occasionally stalls under metaphorical load. Applying −0.6 for paraphrase/cadence and −0.3 for figurative density in peak beats (−0.9 total).

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high and most lines advance stakes or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully and propulsion is steady through the wager climax. However, repetitive sentence stems appear in the reflection zones ("I am devotedly observant," "I ask," "I tell," "I believe," "I call") and the dome's echoing is invoked three times without escalation. Minor paraphrase: "hollow hush that feels like testimony" and later "breathes, every step returning...as echo and doubt" restate without added pressure. The final pen-nib line ("a small spike") lands cleanly. Overall clarity and momentum are maintained, but template cadence and synonym cycles lower the band.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied; figurative language is dense but mostly purposeful ("meteor hush," "laboratory of lost sounds," "winter hardened around the sound"). Information density is high and propulsion steady. Three distinct line-level issues lower the score: (1) Minor paraphrase loop: "I pretend the stars I prick are maps forward, but I am here to hush the dissonance" then "Now I translate baby cries" restates purpose without added pressure. (2) Filter-verb stack in mid-passage: "I thought distance would bleach the sound, but guilt lives in waveforms" uses filter + abstraction where embodied perception would sharpen. (3) Elevated diction in peak beats ("dissonance," "waveforms," "firmware," "filament of ink and the amber's light") drifts toward poetic register that isn't fully earned by the POV's established idiom, triggering minor register friction. These do not obscure closure but accumulate to −0.8 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and metaphoric density is high throughout, creating a lyric texture that supports the accumulative lens. However, figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching (−0.4 for density without taught payoff): "mist licked," "lilac unease," "finger that finds seams," "landslide," "kite tugging" cluster without on-page escalation. Paraphrase loop: "socially perceptive enough to read crowds" (line 3) and "I am good at this because I am socially perceptive" (line 19) restate without added pressure (−0.2). Mixed vehicle: "belief is a kind of finger" pairs tactile with abstract in a way that momentarily obscures sense (−0.3). Information density is high, and no scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with short declaratives ("This is my aberrant mercy") alternating with longer lyric constructions. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "rename without forgetting, to rename without lying" restates the same idea; "warm coldness" recurs four times with minimal variation; "the plaza" appears as sentence subject eight times, creating template cadence. Stock metaphors accumulate: "song climbs a throat," "wound that refuses bleeding," "breath so careful it could survive underwater." Filter-verb stacks in the opening third ("call me," "hearing markets," "drift through me") dull immediacy. High density in the renaming beats partially offsets these issues, but artifacts cluster enough to trigger the patterned-artifact penalty and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("paint shivers like spilled music," "apples lean as if listening"), but overwriting appears in multiple high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching: "nostalgia rises like stage smoke," "a chord that tastes of oranges," "velvet curtains," "silver dust," "burgundy in the rafters" stack within a short span, blurring specificity (−0.5). Template cadence runs in adjacent sentences: "I smell…, hear…, and remember" / "The ghost smiles, a little jealous, a little grateful" / "The coin cools, and the blue bell fades" (−0.4). Some paraphrase loops: "The coin shows the Star, but the paint shivers…" is revisited as "Its hand-painted starlight flares…" without added pressure (−0.2). Clarity remains intact at closure, so artifact penalties stay within Q7. Information density is high; no major scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-level craft shows strong figurative control ("minnows against glass," "color settled into cobalt," "bird landing in a pocket") and high information density in many beats. However, pervasive figurative language without pattern-teaching (nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction) triggers the overwriting density check (−0.5). Template cadence runs appear: "We X…," "Mara Y…," "The Z…" across consecutive lines, plus paraphrase loops ("the pill did not deliver messages; it tuned our awareness" adjacent to "somatic markers we made a grammar") (−0.6 cumulative). A few filter-verb stacks ("asked me to devise," "wanted her brother's last words") dull immediacy under pressure (−0.3). Total artifact debt: approximately −1.4, with some appearing in the final third, which disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and tonal modulation. Minor template cadence in the middle third ("I set," "I speak," "I understand," "I grab," "I swim") nudges toward −0.3, but the closure beats are clean and propulsive. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is controlled and serves the lens: "a warm plateau that my map labels welcoming," "water smashes past and tries to erase the plateau, but the warmth persists like a held vowel." Clarity and momentum are maintained throughout; no artifacts touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and vivid imagery. However, paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "The hush is not empty; it is unearthed silence" / "not to trap it, but to let it move" / "not as evidence, but as invitations"—three parallelisms in close succession create a pattern that reads more like ornamentation than pressure. Figurative density is high without clear pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure, and some metaphors ("prophecy soften into clay") lack specificity. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 to −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, and information density is high (pillbox contents, code method, backstory fragments). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and pattern-taught (silver hush, fire's map, pressure as alphabet). Two frictions: (1) a paraphrase loop in the mid-section ("The plan was simple, and therefore dangerous" followed by restatement of retire/keep/vouchsafe beats what's already shown); (2) stock metaphor overlap ("silver hush" recurs without meaningful variation; "like ice cracking to release water softly" is generic). These do not obscure causality but dull momentum slightly in non-closure beats. Clarity at closure (ring over scars, walking home) is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density (fog "pressed like muslin," water "like a dog too tired to fetch") stays legible. Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "river approved and the fog did not protest" carries tone and agency). However, paraphrase loops appear: "palimpsest promise" is declared in narration, then Wren repeats "That script was our palimpsest promise"; "spindrift serenity" bookends without transformation. Template cadence runs: "He carried," "He trusted," "He watched," "He felt," "He set" cluster in sequential paragraphs. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy, triggering −0.6 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally per the pattern-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm and imagery are strong: "lids ajar like mouths too tired to pray," "smoke lay down again, taught by the day to flatten." Information density is high, most lines layering action and perception. Two friction points lower the score: some reflective passages loop near-synonyms ("steady tenderness, again and again" / "little by little"), and elevated diction ("phototropic," "braided three threads") occasionally floats above the concrete. No template cadence or filter stacks; propulsion stays clean. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though "shawl of times, colors against ash" mixes vehicle slightly (shawl/colors).

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high ("I row toward the point with the rhythm of oars in water, steady, counting breaths, matching my pulse to the quiet thunder in the pilings"). A few early constructions lean decorative ("the harbor waits like a sleeping lung," "quivering hush") without immediate pressure payoff, and minor paraphrase appears ("the lantern breathes" / "the beam revolve through me"). The lock-pick sequence is concrete and propulsive, and the final paragraph lands with no scaffold. Overall clarity and momentum are strong, with small figurative density in non-peak beats preventing entry to the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout, occasionally verging on overwriting ("tusks sweeping comets from grass"), but the metaphors cohere within the established voice and do not obscure causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph rhythm supports the lyric mode. Minor scaffold present: "I do not wait for visitors, yet I prepare a table of listening" slightly restates the prior table mention without added pressure (−0.2). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. The atlas opening and sundial angling beats carry clear propulsion. Information density is strong, with most lines doing double duty (image + character + world).

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("sound traveling across the lilies like a thin fish"), but sustained metaphor across nearly every sentence creates texture drag, especially in high-pressure beats where directness would sharpen momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "I came today to find the thread" / "to find the thread that connects all things" / "I felt the thread that connects all things rise" recycles the same phrase without added pressure. Template cadence runs in opening stems: "After the cloud bursts…After the rains…" Several filter-verb stacks ("I had believed," "I felt," "I watched") dull immediacy. Clarity remains intact but density sometimes substitutes for propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting scene pressure: short bursts during confrontation ("I laughed once, sounding afraid"), longer accumulative builds during reflection. High information density—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language (static as temper, wave as throat singing) is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor artifact: "It bent around speeches like wind around stone, never stopping, simply shaping" and similar metaphor density in the middle third approach overwriting but remain legible and purposeful. Clarity holds throughout; no opacity touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats ("alleys shifted like sleepers turning," "sound spearing my little geometry," "the organ's reverberation reached... like a hand on my shoulder"). While the pattern is taught early and voice-motivated, the accumulation risks overwriting: mixed vehicles ("pipes inhaled, then exhaled," "spaces were people too") and synonym churn ("treaty," "mutiny," "cease-fire," "rebellion") create texture but dull propulsion in the middle third. Two paraphrase loops: "I felt the old tightness rise behind my ribs" / "my lungs fluttered" and "the alleys shifted... offended but listening" / "the alleys sat straighter" restate pressure without adding new information. Template cadence appears in three consecutive sentences beginning with "I" + past-tense verb in the climax paragraph. Information density is strong in the final third, where each line advances the spatial negotiation and thematic closure. No grammatical errors; pronoun references are clear. Apply −0.6 for patterned artifacts (paraphrase loops, template stems, figurative density in peak beats without payoff) and −0.3 for mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("canvases stacked like unslept nights," "laughter and cheap velvet," "ribbon...held a kink like a memory"), occasionally bordering on overwriting in mid-pressure beats where clarity would serve better. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Information density is strong—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or evidence. Minor register drift into abstraction ("by unifying opposites" appears multiple times as a method-label without full dramatization) and some metaphors strain under lyric weight. The closure image is vivid, but the figurative load in the quarry search occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level craft shows strong figurative invention but suffers from density overload and template cadence. Paraphrase loops appear: "They had designed their fog not as punishment, but as refuge, a reversible hallway home. Someone had turned the hallway into a cul-de-sac..." recycles the corridor metaphor without new pressure. Runs of similar stems appear in the climax: "I showed him... I called it... I said..." Stock metaphors cluster: "eyes are two dry prunes," "showman with sleeves," "like a compass." The high metaphor density in peak beats (the nail insertion, confrontation) obscures propulsion rather than sharpening it. Grammar and pronoun references are clean, and specificity is often high, but the cumulative scaffold and ornamental phrasing dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent: "luminous disbelief braids itself through my bow hair," "river light pixelates through latticework," "the receipt is a warmth." A few metaphors strain: "disbelief became luminous" repeats as label rather than image, and "counting...tends toward futures rather than losses" abstracts a beat that warrants concrete action. Template cadence appears in paired clauses: "Recount the two coffees, the three names he tried on like jackets, the five times he looked back downvalley." Information density is strong; no paraphrase loops. Minor −0.3 for figurative overload in the middle third that slows momentum slightly without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high, with lines doing double duty ("the patience of fences and totals"). Minor template cadence appears in the middle third ("The coders asked… I told them…"), but does not touch closure. A few metaphors approach density saturation in the final paragraphs ("borrowed from another valley," "scripture," "breaths with the lions asleep"), yet clarity holds. The loop/scaffold check is mostly clean; propulsion remains steady without dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentences open diversely and information density is high. Minor paraphrase loop in lines 18–19 (both describe the inscriptions as incomprehensible to others). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "flux became syllable, magnitude a verb" is precise. One register drift: "austere and elegant" in line 23 feels elevated for the established voice. The final paragraph stacks several closural gestures which diffuses punch slightly. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high—nearly every sentence carries metaphor—and several clash or overreach: "the lake stops pretending," "the orchard begins to turn the sky like a crank," "the lake unbloomed" pile ornament without clarifying causality. Template cadence appears in the repeated "I [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems across multiple beats. Information density is generally strong, but the opening paragraph front-loads imagery that doesn't all pay off. Paraphrase loop: "guarded druid" and "warlike serenity" recur without added pressure. No clarity breaks at closure, so caps remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with short declaratives ("We told them no") punctuating longer lyric sentences. Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("corridor of hedges bending to form a question mark," "ribbon pulled from a mouth"), but some vehicles strain: "blue hour" is mentioned without prior setup, "cambium" appears twice in close proximity, and "pilgrims pin" is a minor malapropism (pilgrim's badge?). Information density is high, but several lines paraphrase without advancing pressure: "They had not expected the future to arrive early, and they certainly had not expected the garden to start thinking for itself" restates the premise. The metaphor stack in the opening paragraph ("leaf-veins lit with residual lightning from tomorrow," "root-bound visionary," "vow made at noon and unmade at shadow") borders on overwriting. No template cadence, but the compression occasionally obscures causal sequencing (how does the maze "accept our weight" and "reconfigure").

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally with strong opening/closing lines. Information density is high; most sentences advance image, pressure, or character. Minor overwriting in figurative clusters: "palimpsest of old deals, inlaying meaning everywhere the shadows dared to rest" stacks metaphors in one beat. "Inlaying meaning" recurs across three paragraphs, bordering on template cadence but stays legible and pattern-taught. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "I used to wrest amps from vans in the rain, then coil hope onto spindles" establishes backstory, metaphor, and emotional signature). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at recognition ("my hand knew exactly which cabinet, and which night, and why the corner was burned") and breathing in reflective passages. Minor issues: occasional figurative density in mid-pressure beats ("grief kept finding the gap between stories and sleep" followed closely by "the applause sloshed off the shale like water") and one near-paraphrase loop ("facts first" / "facts could hold space" / "facts tilted"). No major scaffold or loops touch the closure beat. Syntax varies; sentence openings avoid template runs.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information density is high: nearly every line advances arbor mechanics, character stance, or thematic motif. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at planting, longer cadences during reflection). No paraphrase loops or template stems. Minor: "kindly methodical" recurs three times across the text, risking repetition without pattern payoff, but does not obscure causality. Figurative language (rail-as-reed, voice-as-water) is coherent and motivated. Zero scaffold or synonym churn in closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high ("the clerkship of tides, stamping dates that have dissolved, and shelving maps that redraw themselves hourly"). However, figurative language saturates nearly every line without clear pattern-teaching or payoff differentiation: "days forget their names," "migrating identities," "minnows of thought," "kelp coat," "wintersun," "slackwater," "raw ore," "frost taking breath"—each evocative, but the unrelenting density blurs hierarchies and occasionally muddles causality (e.g., "the bells know it, and the tide nods" anthropomorphizes without grounding). Several lines loop conceptually: "My work is to preserve wonder in routine" is rephrased as "remembering is just wonder doing chores" and "how routine learns to sing." Minor register drift into abstract philosophizing ("wonder doing chores," "unfinished selves") clashes with the tactile metallurgy and tidal mechanics. Clarity remains above threshold, but momentum drags in the middle third due to over-layered metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: nearly every sentence layers metaphor or simile ("quartz rose like frozen rain," "confessions…each a filament of latent radiance"). In accumulative mode this density serves the texture, but several vehicles blur or contradict ("voice after voice, each a filament" mixes auditory and visual). Paraphrase loops appear: "I had been a ledger and a lockpick; now I became a conduit" restates the earlier shift without new pressure. Template cadence runs in the opening third ("My job was simple…But I had been carrying…I am the kind…"). Information density is high, propulsion steady, and no major scaffolding remains. Register drift into abstract poeticism ("the heartbeat of a hesitation, a chamber where decisions bloom or dry") edges toward workshop idiom in peak beats. Aggregate texture artifacts and mild metaphor muddle justify mid-7 rather than high-7.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are distinct. Information density is high—most lines do two jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity remains strong through the graffiti-hunt and culvert journey. One deduction: figurative language clusters densely in several beats ("ivy whispering time," "coins clinked in a dented cup," "sly and fast," "muscle of earth") without pattern-teaching, trending toward overwriting in the middle third. The filter-verb phrase "seemed less like a ruin and more like a ledger" is acceptable, voice-motivated. No scaffold artifacts or syntax monotony. The final image ("footing") is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense without becoming opaque, but paraphrase loops appear: "The first had arrived...and the second waited unwritten" is restated as "between two fateful letters" three times across the piece. Template cadence emerges in repeated "I [verb]" stems and participle openers ("letting memory touch nothing," "letting it count"). Stock metaphors recur without reweighting—mist as veil, breath as speech, light as knowledge—and the watch's "cyclically reversed" mechanism is asserted but never clarified into concrete action. Information density is low in the middle third, where multiple sentences describe the cipher unfolding without advancing situation or choice. Proximity to published lyric-fantasy phrasing ("shelves curved away like galaxies frozen mid-swing") is notable.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Figurative language is dense throughout—most sentences carry metaphor or simile—and while many land vividly ("coffee darkened like cloud," "bruised fruit against his ribs"), the accumulation in the middle third (eyebrows on strings, destiny with dotted seams, mulberry ache) borders on overwriting without a taught pattern to justify the relentless texture. A few near-paraprase loops appear: "Everything about it suggested..." repeats structurally, and "He thought of..." chains in the climax approach template cadence. Line-level clarity remains high and no loops touch the closure beat, capping deduction at moderate range.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, creating visual cadence through paragraph length and syntactic diversity. Information density is high, with most lines advancing atmosphere, character, or ritual action. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "I cleaned the cold from her skin, lifted lids to wash the final dust from lashes" followed immediately by similar grooming description; "The chip was barbed with tiny circuits" restates "emerald chip glittering in its glass cocoon" without advancing knowledge. Figurative density in the opening third (conch, veils, pulse, whisper-engine) risks overwriting but remains legible. The closure beat is clean. Minor scaffolding ("What I knew was simpler") slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies effectively; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("the grotto as a throat, and the world as a patient voice"). Minor overwriting in the middle third: multiple metaphors per sentence occasionally blur immediacy ("Clouds flowed below the threshold, a white sea carrying silence in ordered waves" stacks three vehicles in one beat). A few template stems recur ("I [verb]" opens multiple sentences in the chamber sequence). No paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high, and the closure image remains clear despite the lyric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and rhythm varies purposefully across the longer sentences, but several lines loop conceptually: "I sell the weight of hesitation, a conscience for hire who charges by the breath it saves" restates the same idea twice, and "sincerely insincere, practiced at admitting the mask" paraphrases its own claim. The opening's metaphorical stacking ("sell the weight," "charges by the breath") borders on overwriting. Figurative density is sustained but coherent—vehicles (weather, wind, instruments) align. No hard artifacts touch closure. Syntax varies and propulsion holds, but the conceptual redundancy in the first third costs momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies, metaphor density is consistent with the lyric mode, and information density is high: most lines do double duty (e.g., "his goal was to teach vanishing to appear" advances both method and theme). Minor paraphrase loop: "He said the lesson would unfurl through the trance" and later "the lesson finished knotting" restate completion without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative language appears in most sentences but is pattern-taught and pays off at closure, so no overwriting penalty applies. A few phrases edge toward abstraction—"decades of maps," "the simple was never easy"—but remain voice-coherent. No scaffolding, template cadence, or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Opening anchors voice and stakes; closing image recharges the ring motif.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly legible ("pulse left wandering… pretending to be stone," "channels lined with memories like resin"). Information density is high; nearly every line advances the accumulative pressure or the navigational method. However, several lines loop conceptually: "I do not move" appears three times in similar phrasing, and "the canyon answers / shifts / says" recurs without fresh specificity. The phrase "arm's speak" and "historically reverent" (used twice) read as template insertions. Template cadence is present in the "I + verb" stems across multiple beats. Cumulative artifact penalty applies: paraphrase loops (−0.2), template stems (−0.4), elevated register drift in peak beats (−0.3), total −0.9, lowering from ~7.8 to 6.9.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere and stance. Rhythm varies naturally, though a few adjacent sentences echo structure: "I think of the word… I think of the word…" without pattern payoff. One paraphrase loop: the light's accommodating nature is restated across two beats mid-story. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("bowl carved from cloud," "hush stays on my hands"); "brilliant dimness" as oxymoron recurs purposefully. No major grammar slips. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the question-mark motif with closure weight. A tighter edit would cut the doubled "I think" stems and compress the mid-climb reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully: longer lyric sentences in the library, shorter beats at surfacing. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is dense but coherent and voice-motivated ("algae remembering lightning," "temporary birds"). Minor penalty: two adjacent sentences in the library section ("The library breathed, and I realized…" followed by "Each glowing sentence drew a thread…") slightly restate the patience-training concept without added pressure, triggering a small −0.2 deduction. Otherwise, craft is exemplary and propulsion holds.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("ambered observatory deck," "honeyed dome," "static bursts," "stellar doubt pooled like black dew") and some metaphors approach mixed territory ("the amber of intention," "snow of the cosmos settle until it clumped into words"). Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated clause structures ("and I realized," "and I gathered," "and together we faced"). Propulsion is present but momentum drags in exposition-heavy beats explaining the prophecy's order. No paraphrase loops; information density is moderate. Closure beat is figuratively charged but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative density is high—sea monsters, glass creatures, gulls refusing shore, wound made of horizon—and largely coherent, though occasionally compressed to near-opacity ("the sound inside offerings," "echo of sacrifice that eats its own name"). Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual pacing. Information density is strong: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "He would read the recordings through scattered light, because light remembers what stone forgets" advances method, theme, and stakes). Minor deductions: a few paraphrase loops ("names were bridges that held" / "names are not cages…but agreements") and elevated metaphors in peak beats ("vacancy between hands," "marrow") that slightly dull immediacy. No proofreading errors detected.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot without scaffolding. Figurative language is controlled and voice-consistent ("drips...single syllables," "devotion stayed brittle," "sea...breathing through damp cloth"). Sentence openings vary; paragraph rhythm creates visual pace. Minor loop: "He believed understanding dripping rates might let him rebuild the timing of the world" and "Once, the tides had matched the bell" restate causal backstory adjacently; apply −0.2. One filter-verb cluster in reflective beats ("He was not brilliant, but he was steady") dulls immediacy slightly but does not obscure closure; apply −0.2. No template cadence, no mixed metaphors, no synonym churn. Final image is concrete and charged: "a silver ripple returned, modest as a memory that decides to stay."

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines loop conceptually without added pressure: "the story… because their separate versions braid into one careful rope of meaning" near the end echoes "stories could hold the broken pieces" from earlier without new particulars. Template cadence appears in the photograph sequence ("The first shows… the second… the third…"). Purple prose clusters in descriptive beats ("sapphire-hued," "lacquered by time," "letters curling into a familiar flourish") without always advancing character or conflict. The final paragraph's "mirrored hush" reprise charges the closure image, but mid-story scaffolding ("he pockets it, then notices") and stock connectors ("Now," "Instead," "Decades later") dull momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied—"She laughed softly, a sound like seeds spilling"—with high information density in many lines. Clarity remains strong and spatial choreography tracks. However, pervasive figurative language in sequential lines ("veils," "curtains," "memory she had not yet lived," "bell of winter inside summer," "living vellum") creates textural density that slows momentum during the inciting beat and middle section. Template stems appear in the final third: "She [verb]" structures repeat across five consecutive sentences beginning "She slid," "She tied," "She laughed," "She tasted," "She stood," triggering the −0.4 to −0.6 penalty for cadence runs and capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in many beats ("parachute buckle rings against the rail, not pretty but certain, a small metallic vow keeping its part of the ritual"). However, figurative language appears in most sentences without consistent pattern-teaching, creating density drag: "rope veins," "braided light," "stitched moth," "breathing cathedral," "lens focusing heat," "roots entering frost," "soap bubbles," "pondwater," "tired hand." Mixed metaphors appear ("clouds whirlpool strangely, like a lens focusing heat rather than light" conflates fluid and optical vehicles). Template cadence runs: "I [verb], and [noun] [verb]" recurs across multiple paragraphs. These artifacts pervade the middle third and touch the closure beat ("weight on my ribs loosens… a harness adjusted"), triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the Q7 rule.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high ("clouds passed under the sparring floor like slow rivers of breath," "names loosened like threads in seawater"), but several phrases loop or restate without added pressure: "slices through pretense and the mind stops lying to itself" closely paraphrases the earlier "blade of attention slices through pretense," and "while history rewrites itself" recurs four times as atmospheric tag rather than causal driver. Template cadence appears in the Neri/Rae introductions ("First was Neri, who had never…Second was Rae, whose laugh…") and in parallel "both wore…both carried" constructions. Pivotal beats—the jar's vibration, the joint-custody announcement—remain clear, preventing deeper penalties, but the accumulation of figurative restatement and scaffold phrasing flattens momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting is pervasive: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, and mixed metaphors muddle logic ("the tunnel swallows its patter, translating it into cymbals of tin and sorrow" conflates swallowing and translating without coherent vehicle). Template cadence runs throughout ("He says," "He has made," "He is," "He lifts," "He mouths," "He yanks," "He kisses," "He keeps") without variation, triggering −0.6 for stem repetition. Paraphrase loops are frequent: the tunnel's function as amplifier is restated multiple times ("returns only what you dare to risk," "repeats that exhale until it becomes a rhythm"), and "mournfully eager" appears twice identically. Register drift into elevated diction ("macerate," "harmonics," "obvervingly") clashes with embodied immediacy in peak beats. Information density is uneven: many lines texture atmosphere without advancing choice or narrowing options. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("the repaired silence"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Text-Artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create momentum ("I say... She tells... I show... She nods"). Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "She smells of vellum and salt, and her eyes catalogue me as if I were a misfiled season" layers sensory detail, metaphor, and relational dynamic). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but coherent in most beats; however, the cluster "boundaries of light," "charter of the library," "pilgrims mistook the moon for a hinge," and "where a page must end for mercy" in consecutive lines risks overwriting without clear causal linkage between vehicles. Grammar and tense are clean, and the final line ("uncertainty sits beside me like a new friend") resolves by image with charged callback. Clarity holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and auditory momentum ("When the penny drops is never a loud moment... the faintest click"). Information density is high: lines often layer image, metaphor, and action without padding. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor deduction: a few figurative constructions in the middle section ("frond delicate as breath held on a winter tongue") approach overwriting, and the density of metaphor in some beats risks slight opacity, but clarity at closure is untouched. The final lines ("I walked with the care of someone who has begun to live") propel cleanly without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic texture. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, character, atmosphere)—and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("cables knitting shadows," "winds braided old advertisements into prayers"). Two concerns: minor template cadence in the middle third ("I stopped naming... I stopped fearing...") and occasional figurative overreach ("goodbye that grew roots in midair," "prickled my gums and steadied my hands") that skirts mixed metaphor. The closure beats are clean and propulsive; scaffold is minimal. A tighter trim of the grandmother and engineer digressions would lift momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several passages show decorative layering without clear advancement: "Sound bent, and the radio broadcast silence shaped like doors" is vivid but borders on ornamental; "ash colored like dawn before the alarm" stacks metaphor without tightening pressure. Minor paraphrase loop: "We emerged... into morning that still looked nocturnal, which felt honest" restates mood rather than adding information. Information density is generally high, but peak beats (the grotto sequence) could be leaner. No major clarity breaks, but texture occasionally substitutes for propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("mirrors leaned inward like listeners," "dust fell like considerate snow"). Information density is high; nearly every line advances the architect's method or the room's response. Two frictions: (1) Paraphrase loop in paragraph 2–3: "Night had thinned to an unsettling calm" / "He came to the optical illusion gallery" / "He said he was there to discover the texture of connection"—three summary lines restate arrival without new pressure (−0.2). (2) Template cadence in the middle third: "He [verb]" opens five consecutive sentences ("He traced," "He anchored," "He drew," "He whispered," "He said"), creating drumbeat rhythm (−0.4). No loops touch the closure beat, so penalties remain non-closure adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully between lyric reflection ("the sea is a sky turned inward") and concrete anchoring ("pitted with salt, heavy as a small moon"). Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (the chain link grounds both past and present motivation; edge geometry serves as method, teaching content, and final communication tool). Minor template cadence appears in the middle third ("I tell," "I teach," "I volunteer," "I imagine") but the pattern reads as intentional anaphora rather than scaffold, and the final third breaks it. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; clarity remains high even during the abstract alien exchange. The opening and closing lines charge the frame effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high: most lines advance setting, character, or stakes without padding. Figurative language is fresh and specific ("steam sketches a question mark," "swallowed star," "hummingbird caught under a jar") without overwhelming clarity. Minor register drift appears in "persistently curious" and "artifact" (slightly elevated for the voice) but does not obscure momentum. One paraphrase near the end: "the first thing found is the will to keep listening" echoes prior patience language without adding new pressure. No scaffold loops or template cadence; clarity remains strong through the elliptical final convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid particulars: "the entrance squeeze pinched my ribs like a hand I owed money," "ice bridged the broken gap," "frost lacquered it delicate." Information density is high—most sentences advance setting, character stakes, or thematic texture. Minor loop: "crashing hush" appears three times across the story; while it serves as a motif, the third use ("inside, the crashing hush became a constant pressure") edges toward paraphrase of the opening anchor without adding new pressure. A few filter verbs ("I felt the cold pull") are present but voice-motivated. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent; no template cadence or synonym churn, and the final image ("evening metal," "sea took a long breath") recharges the opening without explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: "They filed my name among the gone, a death certificate error survivor returned to sign for packages and passwords" does character, stakes, and world-building in one sentence. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("fingernail moon," "rough cartography of regret") is voice-motivated. Minor template cadence in the recalibration sequence ("I recalibrate… then defragment… rethreading") and a faint paraphrase loop between "I came back to fetch wisdom from failure" (twice stated) slightly dull momentum mid-piece. No loops touch the closure unit, and the final lines propel cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with task-phases (observation, climb, coaxing, testimony). Information density is high: most lines do two jobs (e.g., "Each turn of their bodies mapped a ridge, each dive pressed a pause" advances method and stakes). No overt loops or synonym churn. However, figurative density is constant—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or elevated image—without pattern-teaching or payoff, which risks overwriting: "schooling," "stitched a grammar," "braid of notes," "frozen-time monologue" phrasing in "quietly articulate with apology." Template cadence appears in the storm/drought parallel beats ("When storms came… When drought stretched"), which recycle structure without added pressure. Filter verbs ("I felt," "I watched," "I could hear") cluster in high-pressure lines without voice-motivated justification. These artifacts touch the closure third, so 9+ is disallowed globally and high-band entries capped at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is vivid but pervasive: "garden breathed like a sleeping whale," "seedlings... like compass needles drunk on auroras," "staircase of vertebrae descending into black peppermint." In high-pressure beats (the descent, the arrowhead cracking), the metaphor density continues unabated, which dilutes urgency rather than heightening it (−0.4 for density without modulation). Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports the lyric mode. Two minor loops: "I told..." appears in adjacent beats near the end without added pressure; "the voice said/told me" recurs in template cadence (−0.2 paraphrase-loop, −0.2 template stem). Grammar and clarity are clean; no pronoun confusion or spatial muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows high figurative density and varied rhythm, but several beats suffer from overwriting and paraphrase loops. Example: "The orchard shivered, leaves chiming like thin coins" followed immediately by "I could feel their directive clicking, a metronome of law"—two metaphors in adjacent lines without pattern payoff. Template-stem runs appear: "I play because...," "I played softer...," "I played the phrase again...," "I played what I could not yet name..." Clarity remains intact and information density is generally high, but the accumulation of figurative language in the final third (especially "map of wounds that become windows," "first clean sip after a fever") risks coherence. No major loops obscure causality, so closure remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines serve multiple functions (voice, world, pressure). Sentence openings vary, rhythm modulates with scene need. Minor loop: "brittle hush" repeats verbatim in opening and closing, and "respectfully rebellious" appears twice without reweighting. One paraphrase slip: "I navigate by linking absences" followed by "A gap opens a map, and a missing reply forms a road" restates the same method without added pressure. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "weather drums" and "pupil closing around a light" work, though cumulative metaphor load in Mina's scene risks slight overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("drowsy serpent of painted iron," "horses and tigers and swans stacked like sleeping constellations," "letting the hush and the bells speak"), and while most images are coherent and purposeful, the accumulation in nearly every sentence risks overwriting in a high-pressure beat. The oasis and singing sequence (paragraphs 13–17) maintains clarity, but lines like "a crescent of dulled gold scored by teeth of time" and "wind coiled through broken windows, ringing the bells he had hung between couplers, and the air answered with a whispering gleam" layer metaphor on metaphor without always advancing causality. No loops or synonym churn; sentence openings vary. Information density is strong—most lines do two jobs (advance action and build atmosphere). Proofreading is clean. The cumulative metaphoric load in early and middle beats triggers a modest deduction (−0.3 to −0.5 range for density without pattern-teaching), though the closure beats remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.7)
    High information density: most lines do multiple jobs (the scarf smells of ozone/ink and belonged to the mother who "believed libraries kept the weather honest," linking object, backstory, and theme). Rhythm varies purposefully—short beats at turns ("The shelves answer with a long breath"), longer accumulations during the no-wall room exploration. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; opening lines vary. Minor: a few near-synonym clusters ("tilt into new alignments" / "opening a new door" within two beats; "breath" / "breathe" recurs) and one stock metaphor ("candle cupped against drafts"). Figurative density is high but coherent and voice-motivated, not overwriting. Zero scaffold or generation artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and sustained across nearly every sentence, creating lush texture but risking overwriting in peak beats: "a quivering fish," "unfurled like a letter from childhood," "shelves leaned in as if listening is a structure." Mixed metaphors are rare and vehicles remain coherent. Information density is solid; most lines advance image or stance. Template cadence appears in repeated "It…" openers and "I…" stems across adjacent lines, particularly in the final third, applying −0.4 for scaffold loops. No paraphrase cycles. Sentence openings vary; rhythm is purposeful. Clarity remains high despite density; no causality obscured by prose.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.1)
    Metaphorical density is high and mostly coherent ("fog trapped in a jar," "crescent on my memory," "hush of cosmic possibility like river stones"), but several constructions strain clarity: "unassumingly bold" as oxymoron lacks embodied demonstration, "enveloped secrets" is abstract, "weir of shadows" is imprecise, and "stodgy sentinel" clashes with the lyric register. Paraphrase loops appear: "It stuck behind fear like fog trapped in a jar, pressing outward, filming every surface" re-states the prior sentence's "idea trapped behind fear." Template cadence in the courtyard sequence: multiple sentences open with "The locksmith [verb]" or "He [verb]." Information density is uneven—some lines do multiple jobs ("the ribbon slipped free and fluttered like a moth, the hair lifted"), others are decorative ("violet," "velvet dusk"). No severe artifacts at closure, but cumulative line-level drag. Deductions: paraphrase loop −0.2, template cadence −0.4, mixed-register drift −0.3 = net ~−0.9 from a baseline ~7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high (most lines advance setting, image, and stakes), and no paraphrase loops or template cadence appear. Figurative language is controlled and thematically coherent (orchard grafted onto sea, shipwrecks as ribs/barred windows, gull-smudge becoming thought of hand). Minor density excess in the middle third (e.g., "decades later still felt like yesterday" repeated as "Decades later, yes, but not gone") and one stock phrase ("small hinge in the year") slightly reduce crispness, but clarity and propulsion remain strong through the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift across beats. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs ("War took a surname, a river swallowed a neighborhood, love burned the tongue"). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Minor issues: occasional stacked metaphors ("corridor like a bruise remembering light," "dust instructs light to fold") create figurative density in high-pressure beats without clear payoff, risking slight opacity. The phrase "combative tenderness laid bare like a ledger open to audit" mixes vehicles (tenderness/ledger/audit) in the climax, triggering a small coherence deduction. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Solid mid-7s with figurative muddle the only drag.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high ("Each cut was a stitch, weaving between worlds"). Clarity holds through mythic compression. However, several lines loop conceptually: "weaving between worlds" appears three times with minimal reweighting; "the color of wonder" recurs without added pressure mid-text. Template cadence in places: "She [verb]…and she [verb]" structures repeat across adjacent sentences. Figurative language is dense in every beat without creating opacity, but the concentration ("threshing floor for dreams," "unblinking eye," "pupil searching") in the opening third risks overwriting. No causality breaks, so penalties remain in Q7. Applying loop/scaffold and density checks: −0.6 total.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings show variety. Information density is high, with most lines advancing atmosphere and action. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without break ("patient rainbows," "ladders on the floor," "a bell struck from the inside," "gentle vacuum where sound would be"), creating density that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies. "Interlaced hush" appears five times, risking template cadence. One paraphrase loop: "The sanctuary held its breath" followed immediately by entering the net sequence without propulsion between. Deduction: −0.6 for figurative saturation in high-pressure beats; −0.3 for phrase recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density high: most lines do two jobs (e.g., "rain eats old limestone like a slow animal" grounds setting and tempo). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor artifacts: "The hush was not miracle, but architecture" echoes "He said it was a whispered chapel, not by miracle" within six paragraphs—acceptable thematic recurrence but nears redundancy. "Methodically curious" appears three times, twice as direct label. Figurative density ("bellows," "needles," "embroidery," "purl") risks overwriting in lyric sections but stays legible and voice-coherent. Final image ("pale bevel that echoed the horizon") charges closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (setting, character stance, thematic charge). Sentence openings vary, rhythm accelerates and breathes appropriately, and figurative language is controlled ("shy moon," "drowned lung," "domestic planet") without stacking. Two minor artifacts: "I told myself" and "I thought" appear as light filter verbs, acceptable in this reflective mode but slightly dulling immediacy in a couple of beats. One paraphrase near-loop: the "physics of letting go" phrasing recurs three times across the piece, the third instance in the penultimate paragraph feeling slightly redundant. No fatal loops, clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm and syntax vary purposefully; sentence openings avoid template runs. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character stance, or the ghost-encoding sequence. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent ("sky's drumskin," "little harp for static," "careful goats on a ridge"). Two localized weaknesses lower the score: (a) Paraphrase loop in the opening—"I came there as a seldom-heard balladeer" followed immediately by "People rarely gathered so high, yet their wants climbed"—the second line restates scarcity without added pressure (−0.2). (b) The phrase "a hush shaped like an algorithm learning to stutter a lullaby" mixes vehicle (algorithm) and tenor (lullaby) in a way that strains coherence without clear payoff (−0.3). No scaffold or syntax monotony; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with the ten-floor structure; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Figurative density is high throughout ("frost flowers lace," "sky…breathe on cue," "elevator shudders like a beast remembering its spine") and mostly coherent, but the accumulation in peak beats (floors 8–10) risks overwriting without clear payoff escalation. Minor template cadence: "On the [ordinal] rise" recurs mechanically across all ten beats. Information density is strong—most lines advance understanding or charge objects—but occasional paraphrase loops appear ("affection helps steadiness, so I let my voice hum small reassurances").

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths that breathe with the emotional arc. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and thematic resonance simultaneously. Figurative language is dense ("migrating lanterns," "receipts," "veins") but largely coherent and voice-motivated. Minor slips: a few phrases edge toward overwriting ("generous as a cathedral," "the universe keeps its receipts") and one near-loop ("quietly explosive" appears twice in different contexts). The final image is concise and charged. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with opening lines establishing the hushed tone and later beats accelerating through the countdown. Information density is high: most lines advance action, character perception, or thematic image. Minor deductions: a few template stems repeat ("I test the limit of...") and some figurative language in the middle section ("the heightened stillness trembles the dust into motes," "as if windows opened inward") borders on stock metaphor without full voice-grounding. No loops or scaffold obscure causality, and the final image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance image, pattern, or pressure. Rhythm varies naturally; opening stems avoid template repetition. Minor density lapse: "I had kept, tucked inside my coat, a polyglot's phrasebook dog-ear, a torn corner mottled with grease..." could compress further. One small scaffold loop: "I made a note on the chart and a second note on the kettle lid" then "We recorded the figure-eight page reference on the dog-ear"—both note-taking beats; consolidation would tighten. No figurative muddle in the closure beat; the final lines propel cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is specific—"breath of warm cedar," "palm-sized wheel filed to a notch." However, pervasive figurative density slows momentum: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor without clear causal linkage ("library hum like a patient harbor," "dawn spilled...like milk poured into ink"). Paraphrase loops appear: "repair was not a single motion but a rhythm of attention" echoes "tide inhaling and exhaling the shoreline of brokenness" without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle third with repeated "he [verb]" stems. These artifacts dull the closure image and trigger the Q7 penalty pack: −0.8 for density without pattern-teaching, −0.3 for paraphrase loops, total −1.1, landing at 5.9.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "sound threaded the arches like a humble comet," "hope here is brambled," "nebula of respite," "dissolving ring that felt like rain inside our ribs," "row by breath, not by muscle." Mixed metaphors and vehicles that violate logic (fingers are wind, bell sprays mist, air flows as river) muddle clarity in peak beats. Paraphrase loops ("reexamine" appears twice; "tired together rather than tired alone" echoes "strangers become family"). Template cadence in rescue sequence: "lifted…kept talking…by sunset…we feasted…that night…in the morning." Cumulative artifact debt reaches −1.2 in Q7; some vehicles confuse rather than sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff that justifies the load. Examples: "a cathedral of time," "breath of oil," "bruised awe," "calculus of mercy," "kernel spring," "probability of goodbye." In peak beats (the final winding and singing), the figurative language does not compress but instead expands into abstraction ("hush concentrated like a rainstorm," "syllables like constellations"), reducing propulsion. Apply −0.5 for density without adequate payoff and −0.2 for register drift in a few peak moments ("vouchsafe," "elegies"). No loops or scaffold detected; information density is high when metaphor is stripped.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "He placed it on his tongue and let it learn our breathing" advances plot, characterization, and world logic). Rhythm varies purposefully, and opening/closing lines charge the frame. Minor deductions: a few near-paraphrase pairs ("I moved my hands through the air, leaving impressions without touching" echoes an earlier construction without added pressure) and two runs of similar sentence openings in the middle third ("We slipped," "We stepped," "We waited") create brief template cadence. No loops touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies sentence length and structure; opening lines anchor voice and the final line resolves by image that recharges prior motifs (ravine, unbroken). Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "I diverged from my mentor, from my sister, from the consensus" establishes professional conflict, family rift, and design philosophy simultaneously). Minor deduction for two paraphrase adjacencies: "I could not bear a lab's confession, nor the courtroom's" followed immediately by "so I came to the river" slightly delays propulsion, and "The foam taught me that connection is not a single bond but a score of entrances" is then restated as "I heard my polymers recast as orchestration." No loops touch the closure beat. Figurative language (mist, chrysalis, swallows) is controlled and purposeful, though density approaches the ~60% line in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances world-building, character stance, or ritual progression. Some figurative language verges on overwriting ("fog had tried to learn manners," "rain deciding to be snow"), but the accumulative texture supports the lyric lens and remains legible. Minor paraphrase loop: "I set the bottled moonlight beside it" followed immediately by "I lifted the moonlight, poured a ribbon" within three lines creates slight redundancy. No major scaffold or template cadence detected; sentence openings vary, and rhythm breathes with scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("memories… taste like salt note that made my jaw ache like old rope," "emotion spilled like brine"). Minor loop: "the keeper ate while staring at his hands" repeats the motif of hands without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the opening third ("I was the chef," "People came to me," "I learned long ago") but does not pervade. One metaphor strain: "blistered peppers until they hissed like dunes in moon wind" asks peppers to sound like wind-rubbed sand, which blurs the vehicle. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. No major scaffold or clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often lovely ("borrowed starlight," "voices like gravelled rain"), yet runs of elevated metaphor in almost every sentence dilute clarity and create register drift unanchored to Mara's librarian POV. Paraphrase loops appear: "separate" recurs across three paragraphs without pressure change; "under the hush of borrowed starlight" is repeated verbatim as a refrain without earned cost. Template cadence is visible in parallel constructions ("give us paz, give us shalom, give us salaam"). No loops touch the closure beat directly, so the cap at −0.8 applies, but propulsion suffers from lyric density that does not advance stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high; most lines advance image, stakes, or character logic. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without rest beats, creating cumulative opacity in high-pressure moments: "static hair," "field of equations," "heartlight," "neuronal tide," and "mineral and gentle" stack metaphors whose vehicles occasionally clash (light as heartbeat, memories as mineral). The phrase "quenching need" in paragraph 28 is abstract without concrete anchor. Some sentence stems recur ("I would...," "The canyon...," "I felt..."), creating template cadence. Proofreading is clean; no grammatical errors or spatial confusion. The overwriting does not break causality but dulls immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high and sustained: most sentences carry metaphor or elevated diction ("syrup," "wick," "pomp," "gentle verdicts"). In the safe-opening sequence—arguably the story's peak pressure—phrases like "pulse that pounds in archives" and "little doubts that polish my purpose" maintain lyric texture but soften propulsion. Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines: "I am not gathering loot; I am composing the patience" restates the prior "One by one the safes offer their skeptics" without new pressure. Template cadence in the crown-trial paragraph ("I try three... so I remove them... The fourth is plain... When it touches my brow") stacks parallel structure without variation. No loops or clarity breaks touch the closure, but accumulation across the middle third lowers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often effective ("each fracture a faultline of memory," "fog, its phrases rising from the roots"), but several metaphors stack without clear vehicles: "leaves flutter like eyelids nearing sleep" is vivid, yet "breath of hush follows" and "syllables" used for tree-sounds read as mixed logic. Paraphrase loops appear: "empathy in motion" recurs four times, twice in identical phrasing, without reweighting; "I came here to create music in a silent world" appears verbatim twice. Template cadence is pervasive in the middle third: seven consecutive paragraphs open with "I [verb]" or "The [noun]," dulling propulsion. Information density is high in sensory detail but scaffolding like "I realize" and "I understand" could be cut for directness. No loops touch the closure beat, limiting damage.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: most lines advance multiple jobs (character, stakes, atmosphere). Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated—"field lines sang," "promises do the same," "bishops on color." Minor deduction for slight template cadence in the penultimate paragraph (three consecutive "I would" + infinitive constructions, −0.3) and one filter-verb cluster mid-story ("I could read," "I felt"), but these do not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic variety. Information density is high: many lines do more than one job (e.g., "I am an eclectic pacifist, equal parts repairer, listener, and reluctant performer of truth" establishes role, stance, and internal contradiction). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor deductions for figurative density: metaphors appear in most sentences of the opening and middle sections without always advancing pressure ("smoke around the clasp," "miniature winter ending," "moth lungs"). These remain legible and voice-motivated, but the accumulation risks slowing momentum slightly. Grammar and punctuation are clean; no pronoun ambiguity. The opening line anchors voice and stakes; the final line resolves by image and action that recharge the archive motif. One run of "She writes" × three could be tightened, but it serves the catalog rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("root seeking stone," "patience hung homes," "wildflower hush"), but in high-pressure beats metaphor sometimes stacks without propulsion: "the smell unfurled, feral and cavernous" is vivid yet does not advance the beat causally. Template cadence appears in paired structures ("then the owls, then the silence") and repetitive clause openings ("I planted… I built… I told… I journalize"). A paraphrase loop occurs between "knowledge does not sit still but flows beneath choices" and "undercurrent of wisdom braided through rot." Information density is generally high, but these artifacts dull momentum at closure's edge.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (world-building + emotion + sensory texture). A few runs of near-synonyms appear ("whirling silence," "murmuring hive of absence") and some metaphors layer densely in high-pressure beats without always advancing causality. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively. Clarity holds, but the density of figurative language in the middle third occasionally slows momentum rather than propelling it.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: "flight engineer's patch to my vest, the cloth oval a borrowed authority and a vow" does character, object, and theme work in one image. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer reflective lines in survey mode, clipped syntax during the landing ("The patch barely stirs, the tape barely flutters"). Zero paraphrase loops; each move advances spatial understanding or tightens stakes. Figurative language is controlled: "canyons do not care about names," "dust devil…trained by walls," "air should be bored by then." Minor slips: "Ribbon tape flashes from magnetized stakes, drawing pale currents like a slow animal breathing" stacks two metaphors (flashes/drawing, pale currents/animal) in one beat, creating slight density without muddle. "Hazy precision is an ethic" borders on thematic declaration but the colon and concrete follow-through ("look close enough to respect error") rescue it.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.9)
    High information density and vivid figurative language ("the sky poured a slow river of green and rose," "stone remembered snow") but density approaches overwriting in peak beats: nearly every sentence in the middle third carries metaphor without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.4). Template cadence appears in five adjacent lines: "They [verb]…They [verb]…They [verb]" (−0.5). Some paraphrase loops: "the hush was not silence; it was a shape waiting for breath, the negative of a statue" restates the same idea across two clauses without added pressure (−0.2). Clarity remains high; no causality obscured. Combined artifact deductions total −1.1 in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most sentences advance both atmosphere and choice. "The flute was our shuttle, bright and sly, a way to thread seams without tearing either side" compresses backstory into present stakes. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively. Deductions: paraphrase loop between "I had failed to seal a breach" and "the breach had opened beyond a gully" restates without added pressure (−0.2). "Avalanchingly quiet" appears twice without functional shift, reading as decorative recurrence rather than evolving meaning (−0.3). "The answer came slowly, woven of miscounts and pride, a ledger of timings I had hurried past" uses elevated register ("ledger of timings") that drifts slightly from the established voice (−0.2). Template cadence in sequential "I [verb]" openings across the middle third is mild but present (−0.3). Total artifact debt −1.0; no closure-beat contamination. Propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines layer action, image, and thematic weight. Rhythm varies purposefully between compressed lyric bursts and longer contemplative sentences. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the halo fragment warms" / "the halo fragment brightens" / "the halo fragment cools" / "the halo fragment glows" recycles the same beat without added pressure across four mentions. Appositive constructions stack heavily ("not by theft but by careful audition," "not substitution, but a musical key change," "not as a boast but a diagnostic"), creating a noticeable syntactic pattern that becomes scaffolding rather than voice-motivated rhythm. Filter verbs remain sparse and voice-appropriate. No clarity breaks or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and auditory texture. High information density: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "green pouring into the snow like sap returning to old wood" advances atmosphere, stakes, and setting). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor密度 slip: "I introduce myself and the ridge lightens behind me" could integrate the two actions more tightly. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, though density is high throughout without a clear pattern-teaching moment to justify it in an accumulative lens—still, the effect supports the lyric closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.3)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "frozen rain," "shy fish," "breath making banners." Two minor muddles appear: "shifted hush" risks abstract placeholding, and "fate is a lattice" + "strand to pluck" mixes weaving with string-instrument metaphor within one sentence. A mild paraphrase loop occurs mid-piece: "the arbor had listened" / "the glass remembered because it had listened" restates the witnessing premise without added pressure. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with scene needs (short declaratives at the communion beat, longer syntax during reflection). No scaffold or pronoun drift. Information density is generally high; most lines advance atmosphere or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density pervades nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or escalation payoff: "attic thunder," "raveling silence tugging at the hems of memory," "cloth thinking," "wound of the dead river where frogs kept a lighthouse." Many metaphors are strained or self-contradictory ("attic thunder," "lighthouse" kept by frogs), reducing clarity. Template cadence appears in repeated "and" + noun constructions and parallel "she [verb]" stems across multiple beats. Paraphrase loops are present: "raveling silence" recurs four times without added nuance. Information density is high, but propulsion is blunted by the relentless figurative overlay. The final image ("wistful yet stilled, waiting for morning") is clear and resonant, but artifacts touch several closure-adjacent beats.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is vivid ("arches floated overhead like patient whales," "silk listened"), though density dips in the reflective middle stretch where several lines paraphrase the bargain concept without added pressure. Minor template cadence appears in the opening third ("He was quietly determined… He listened… He told us") and some near-synonyms recur ("coax resilience," "bartered awakenings"). The closure image is clean and propulsive. Information density is high in action beats but uneven across the three-night structure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high—most lines do double duty (world-building plus interiority)—and sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Minor loop: "cyclically spontaneous" appears twice in similar phrasing without added pressure. A handful of elevated metaphors ("a planetary aurora poured into cheap tempered glass") approach overwriting but remain legible and voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and the final line propels without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with lines often doing double duty (e.g., "He saw the stones, looked toward the sleeping mainland, and took the letter without a word" advances action, spatial choreography, and emotional subtext). No paraphrase loops or major scaffold. Minor deductions: a few lines border on overwriting—"Wings brushed the glass where fog swirled like breath around a sleeping child" stacks metaphor in a high-pressure beat, and "the luminescent ache that guards a coastline better than iron" risks slight abstraction. The figurative load is purposeful and pattern-taught (the piece is lyric-accumulative), but the density in a couple of beats nudges this below 8.0. Overall propulsion is strong, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("storm has a mouth open at the sky and teeth made of waves"), but some vehicles strain logic ("jokes were lightning," "cat with sparks for fur"). Paraphrase loop appears: "I feed it names...The storm laughs, and I answer" restates interaction without added pressure. Template cadence visible in repeated "I [verb]" stems across multiple paragraphs. Information density is strong in setting details, but climactic beats (child's arrival, final vow) are told rather than dramatized, dulling propulsion. Clarity holds; no major pronoun or tense breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance understanding of the magnetism principle through concrete action or sensory detail. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the widow experiment, breathing in reflective passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the concept of "magnetism as posture/tilt" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure, and "quietly explosive" appears as both descriptor and callback without evolving function. Template cadence surfaces in the final third with repeated "I [verb]" constructions. Figurative language is mostly coherent but occasionally dense ("stories cling...as if my apron were magnetized iron" immediately followed by more metaphors). The "scattered sapphires" image is vivid but the beam-as-river extended metaphor requires careful tracking. No major clarity breaks, but the accumulation of these patterns prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent: "moon cleared, its brass seams warmed," "corridor waited for me to hear it," "sorrow line like a river on a map." Rhythm varies and information is layered. However, several instances of overwriting cluster in the middle third: "rusted to the sharpness of sugar" mixes tactile contradiction, and the phrase "recognition could be measured, as if sorrow could wear a badge" stacks two metaphors without full coherence. Template-cadence runs appear ("I kept it because... I wanted to discover... The sextant lay beside... I opened its spine...") across ~four adjacent lines, triggering a modest artifact penalty. No loops in the closure beat; momentum is strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in many beats: "the window becomes a loom when coaxed, each flaw a hook, each stripe of mica a shuttle" does multiple jobs. Clarity is generally strong, with logical action order and no major pronoun tangles. However, paraphrase loops appear: "I gather what is dropped, lost, or sung under breath, and coax it into usefulness" is restated conceptually in "We would weave a dawn from their lives, not from clocks"; "bound release" is glossed three times with slight variation. Template cadence runs occur in the middle third: "I thread in… I splice… I stitch…" across adjacent lines. Figurative density is high without clear escalation: "patient stars," "skirts," "winked approval," "sticky laughter" cluster in non-peak beats, approaching overwriting (−0.4). These artifacts (paraphrase −0.2, template −0.5, density −0.4) accumulate to −1.1, capping this category below 7.5 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the library sequence. High information density in beats like "We did not apologize first, which is to say we stacked our motives on the table until their weights explained the slope of our choices." Minor scaffold: the phrase "enlarged tranquility" recurs three times without evolving meaning, and "within arm's reach of midnight" appears twice (invitation, ending) as a frame but not a charged reprise. The line "soothing looked like taking sides" is economical; "his eyes reflected the lamps as if translating light back into flame" is vivid but slightly ornamental. No loops or template cadence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, image, or theme. Rhythm varies naturally ("The courtyard accepts me... testing the patience... then offering a rustle"). Minor deductions: a few lines lean into decorative phrasing without added pressure ("etiquette" in "cloaked itself in moss and etiquette"; "thinking of snow" in the penultimate paragraph feels ornamental). One paraphrase loop: "guerrilla gardening" appears three times across the piece, twice as metaphor and once as method, but the third use adds no new pressure. No template cadence or major artifact, but the figurative density occasionally slows momentum in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally vivid with strong imagery ("icicles spelled alphabets of patience," "numbers that rang like bells left inside melting glaciers"). Information density is high and most lines advance atmosphere or action. However, several issues accumulate: the phrase "illusions fade to memory" appears twice verbatim without reweighting; "by sampling frequencies" becomes a template that appears four times in similar constructions; some mixed metaphors ("thunder softened its teeth," "clouds opened corridors like translucencies between tombstones") strain coherence. The ornate diction occasionally obscures rather than clarifies ("irridial sheen" is a rare word that may be overreach). Apply −0.8 for multiple text-pattern issues (template phrase, repetition, metaphor mix) that don't quite touch closure but reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and figurative language is mostly controlled. However, near-paraphrase loops appear: "the hush held the words inside" echoes "the hush forbade"; "comforting unease" recurs without reweighting. Template cadence in the middle third ("She would buy and almost buy, promise and almost promise") and filter-verb stacks ("felt the pier breathe," "felt like a warning") dull immediacy. These patterns pervade non-closure beats, triggering accumulation penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character (taste-navigation), setting (lavender bluff, aurora), or theme (weather as custodianship). However, several beats carry figurative density that slows momentum without pattern-teaching: "as if gravity were reciting her biography," "smiled like lightning reframed as etiquette," "aurora crackled, loud as vinyl." These metaphors are coherent individually but accumulate without clear payoff at closure. The final paragraph partially recovers with concrete images ("over the lavender bluff while the forests finished elections").

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with sentences that layer action, image, and theme. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (crystal "like frozen dawn," tumblers "thrum") is coherent and voice-motivated. Template-cadence check: the repeated structure "after the last echo of laughter fades" (opening, midpoint, near-closure) reads as intentional motif rather than loop, since each instance reweights the phrase. Minor artifact: "the broken combination lock mocking how knowledge alone cannot turn what grief split" stacks metaphor and abstraction in one line, momentarily slowing the beat. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies and supports pressure, with short beats during confrontation and longer accumulative sentences during discovery. Information density is high—most lines advance world, character, and stake. Two paraphrase loops lower momentum: "Words unsent collect in my ribs like dust in louvers, and their absence dries everything I touch" restates the candor-as-water metaphor already established. Filter-verb stack in mid-section ("I lifted one and listened, and I heard... I uncorked another") acceptable as procedural rhythm. Some elevated figuration ("reefed with arrows," "punctuation waiting to make sense") verges on overwriting but remains legible. No template cadence or synonym churn; closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("furled clouds," "sleeping throat"). Overwriting clusters in non-peak beats: "unclasped and clasped her voice like a careful hand" and "colorless as sleep" approach purple without breaking clarity. Two near-paraphrases in the opening third ("silence did not wound her; it tuned her" then "her method was precise and simple") create minor drag. Information density is high in the Keepers' arrival and shard-activation beats. No loops touch the closure unit, capping deductions at −0.4. Metaphors occasionally stack ("starlight," "rang her bones," "canal") but remain legible. Grammar and tense are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high; most lines do double duty (establishing setting, advancing android interiority, seeding motifs). Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates with scene pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language (roses as "small declarations," fears as "small devices for directing heat") is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "I realize my care has always been an escape" followed immediately by "Every adjustment I make is another joining," where the second restates the insight. One instance of elevated abstraction ("fragmented wholeness is the only logic my designers trusted") slightly exceeds the android's operational lexicon but remains legible. No artifacts touch the closure beat. Clean grammar, consistent tense, clear action sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high across most beats. However, patterned lyricism pervades: "each rib a rumor, each breath witness," "the lock changed from metal to ache, then listening," "we heal in the hearing." These metaphoric strings cluster in the climax without teaching a pattern early, blurring concrete action under decorative layers. Template cadence appears in the final third: five consecutive sentences open with bare subjects + past-tense verbs ("One carried," "Another explained," "I passed," "No camera rolled," "A vendor stopped"), reducing propulsion. No paraphrase loops, but figurative density in peak beats triggers mid-band positioning per the overwriting check.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are distinct; information density is high (lines often do double duty as world-building and character revelation). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor ("spider of the rigging had finished its web" after "we measured the timeframe as a spider spins") reuses the spider image without clear linkage. Occasional elevated register ("barometric weight," "lyrical code breaker") edges toward overwriting but remains legible. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity and propulsion are maintained. Minor deduction for density near the threshold in high-pressure beats, but no closure-harming artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, and the central quest simultaneously. Figurative language is purposeful and controlled (gravity as "mischievous," lanterns as "birds on a winter wire") with consistent vehicle logic. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, avoiding template cadence. Deductions accumulate: minor paraphrase loop in paragraphs describing the tin's scent shift (salt/paper restated); one run of "I [verb]" stems in the exhumation sequence across three sentences; elevated metaphorical density in the chemist scene where nearly every line carries a figure without clear pattern-teaching at that moment. These artifacts appear in supporting beats, not at closure, capping penalty at −0.6.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative language dominates nearly every sentence ("sleeping stars," "velvet riverbed," "paper thunder," "moonmilk," "lantern of calm"), creating a density that, while pattern-taught early, risks oversaturation in high-pressure beats where clarity would sharpen impact. Some vehicles are mixed or contradictory ("tranquil blaze" remains unresolved; "iron noon" and "gears" are abstract threats without tactile grounding). Paraphrase loops appear: "hush" and "silence" recur without added pressure across multiple adjacent lines. Syntax varies purposefully, and information density is generally high, but the lyric mode flattens urgency when the code resists; the closure beat ("the code untied like wet shoelaces") mixes registers—colloquial vehicle in elevated frame—without clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift naturally. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "He kept an antique desk seal on the table, heavy and carved with a crest of ivy, and he pressed it into wax before we spoke of anything difficult" introduces object, ritual, and emotional threshold). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "steam turns to rain on cold glass," "small obedient star," "cathedral" rooftops. Two artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops appear ("agreed upon lies…a grammar of respectfully held illusions…an ethics of sheltering"), and elevated diction occasionally drifts from the narrator's established voice ("strangling and embracing at once" reads slightly precious for a narrator seeking plain syntax). The final image is vivid and propulsive, but mid-story beats carry faint template cadence in the weekly-lesson summary paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.3)
    Information density is high; most lines layer image, action, and thematic weight. Rhythm varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence in the middle third ("bright animal," "weather pushing against a door," "library of frost"), risking overwriting without a taught pattern to justify the density. The transfer beat ("mapping tones to gestures, breaths to footfalls") tells the mechanism rather than showing it, and "the memory bled like ink" mixes metaphors (sound/ink) without resolving the vehicle. Minor pronoun ambiguity: "its winter" and "it asked" require momentary back-reference to confirm "child/echo."

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—heritage rose thorn as nib, key with no apparent lock, unlinking strokes—and while many images are purposeful (thorn remembers hands, key hums with aurora), several metaphors stack without advancing pressure: "lock is a silence waiting," "door opens without swinging," "time is the small space grief needed." In peak beats, metaphoric vehicles occasionally violate physical logic (How does a key lower into a "cradle of air"? How does time become "the small space grief needed"?). Template cadence appears in runs: "I [verb]… I [verb]… I [verb]…" across paragraphs 18–20. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 16–17 restate "forgiveness of the unfinished" without new detail. Apply −0.8 for density + coherence friction and −0.4 for template cadence in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences carry strong rhythmic variety and high information density; figurative language is purposeful and image-driven. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively. However, the middle question sequence contains subtle paraphrase loops: "Who keeps you / Who summons you / Who refuses you" follows a template cadence across multiple beats without escalating syntax to match conceptual deepening. A few constructions approach preciousness ("the thing that makes an echo choose the world again") where plainer phrasing would sharpen momentum. No clarity breakdowns, and the lyric mode remains legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("windows of connection," "ribs where cabins gape like pulled teeth," "milky bruise"), but the opening paragraph stacks metaphors without clear propulsion: "borrowed starlight," "halos," "plankton," "windows of connection" within ~60 words. Rhythm varies purposefully in later beats ("quick, careful, insistent as a metronome"). Minor paraphrase loop: "I expose what sinks beneath silence" / "the dead are shy but relentless when their truth wants surface" restates the same concept across adjacent lines. No major scaffold or template cadence, but pervasive lyricism in high-density clusters reduces immediate clarity. Deduction: −0.6 for figurative density in opening without immediate beat advancement, −0.2 for paraphrase adjacency.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives ("I nod, and the fireflies nod with me") alternate with longer accumulative sentences. Information density is high; most lines advance image, character, or thematic pressure. Minor loop artifacts: "scintillatingly somber" appears twice (fireflies, courage analogy), and "moon paths" recurs without added function in the second mention. Template cadence surfaces briefly in the middle third: "They lead me… They guide me… Everywhere, hands…" runs three consecutive parallel stems. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; one mixed vehicle: "storms inside cups" pairs storm (chaos) with foam (ephemeral pattern) without clarifying whether the whisk creates or calms. Strong verbs and specific nouns dominate: "lurched," "mustering courage," "combing our hair with green combs." No grammar errors; tense stable. Overall propulsion maintained despite modest decorative accumulation in descriptive beats.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high and sentence openings vary; rhythm accelerates through investigation and breathes at closure. A few figurative moments risk overwriting: "dust storm came like a herd of hammers, chewing the horizon into grit" mixes vehicle slightly (hammers chew), and "I rebuilt a life, by reassembling shredded letters" reads as minor typo or comma splice. "Slicings are invitations to patient hands" and "frequency…shepherded dust" employ metaphor purposefully without muddle. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; propulsion remains clear. The final paragraph's lyric compression ("steadier, having traded a curse for a calibration") lands cleanly. Minor deduction for the "herd of hammers…chewing" vehicle contradiction and the comma-splice/life typo in the reassembly line, but overall clarity and momentum hold.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    High information density and rhythmic control: "observatory rode the storm like a ship," "gossiping bones," "stormlit observatory above clouds." Sentence openings vary; no loops. Minor overwriting in figurative clusters: "prophecy as pattern," "biography of weather," "stowaway instructions," "birds that refuse wings" stack metaphor without always advancing pressure. One paraphrase near the middle: "We were not building machines only; we were building the biography of weather" restates the project's scope abstractly after concrete action. No scaffolding or template cadence. Clarity remains high; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high and sentences layer action with atmosphere ("I corked it by reflex and held the glass to the light, and the light trembled as if reading a diary"). Rhythm varies purposefully. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting in figurative density: metaphors appear in most sentences of the village-gathering beat ("vowels ready for breath," "rescuing harmony like a child from an attic," "hinge between rooms") without full pattern-teaching, triggering ~−0.4. The closure beat remains clean. One stock phrase: "azi/positively wistful as if their cheeks had rehearsed a happy ache" feels slightly algorithmic but does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies, figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("foghorn sigh," "freckles of dying light"). Line "vibrational matching" and "sonic absolution" recur without loops. One paraphrase slip: "storms behave like creditors when they smell leverage" / "storms want work rather than spectacle" restates similar content. Template cadence in early expository lines ("He had sworn," "He had studied," "He would adapt") triggers −0.4. Elevated diction in peak beats ("shepherd danger into a different harbor") adds −0.2 for register drift. Figurative language in most sentences of the lens-room confrontation (sound "poured," "thorough," "chimed faintly," "remembered drowned orchards") densifies without mixed metaphors but nears overwriting threshold. No causality break; artifacts penalized here only.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Each season I unyoke another yapping urgency" establishes character, stakes, and metaphor simultaneously). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the viaduct sequence and breathing in the teaching scene. Minor scaffold: "I told" appears three times in quick succession mid-story, creating a template cadence that slightly flattens momentum. One paraphrase loop: "the horizon is closer than before" after "the world admit us" restates the same idea without added pressure. Zero major loops or figurative muddle in peak beats; the final image is dense and propulsive. Sentence openings vary; paragraph structure supports scene rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Syntactic variety and rhythm are strong; sentence openings vary and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Information density is high: most lines advance observation, memory, or decision. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Clarity holds throughout; spatial choreography (grates, rails, niche, air shaft) tracks cleanly. Minor deduction: a few constructions edge toward slightly elevated diction ("fortified vulnerability held like a drawn line," "testimony released by pressure and heat") that, while legible and voice-consistent, approach figurative density in adjacent lines without full pattern-teaching. No major artifacts, but the cumulative figurative load in the middle third (lantern's wick as lung, darkness taught to gather, memories braided) occasionally slows propulsion slightly before the final beats regain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do two jobs. The opening and closing images charge the frame effectively. However, repeated stems appear: "He told her…He said…He asked…I will tell him…I will ask him…I will say" clusters in exposition. Figurative density is high ("slow fish," "teeth in uncertain smile," "thorn of bent metal," "sliver of midnight," "verdict deferred") and occasionally stacks without breathing room. No major loops touch closure, but the scaffolding mid-story triggers a small momentum drag and disallows 9+ across categories per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well ("Click by click," short declaratives at climax). Information density is high; most sentences advance action or character. However, paraphrase loops appear: "He had a motivation...to ring a bell" / "The bell was a theory, maybe a machine, maybe a prayer" restate the premise across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence runs in the final third: "He knew...he set...then he marked...Outside, the...the yearning algorithm..." (five successive declarative stems). Stock metaphors: "tears...that he denied," "steam lift him into the work ahead." These patterns dull momentum in non-closure beats and trigger the artifact penalty pack, preventing entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or charge the motifs (numbers, patch, playlists). Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing anchors are strong. Minor scaffold appears in the middle third: "a quiet constellation of Aida, her messages, her drafts, her flagged spam, the album no one heard" reads as a list without pressure, and "the sensed absence turn solid, like holding a coat still warm" is vivid but slightly generic. No paraphrase loops or template cadence across adjacent lines; clarity and propulsion hold through the vault sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with minimal loops. Figurative language is consistently controlled and purposeful ("lanterns shaped like pears," "guilt would be compost, not a flag"), avoiding mixed metaphors. One brief paraphrase near the ending ("not together and not apart, the smallest synchronized movement") restates nuance without adding pressure, but the slip is minor and does not touch the closure image. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify. No template cadence, scaffold, or register drift. Strong propulsion and clarity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift; figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Information density is strong: most lines do multiple jobs (the parasol tip is heirloom, tool, and closure image). Minor pattern artifact: several lines open with "I [verb]" in the middle third, creating a brief template cadence ("I volunteer," "I learned to trawl," "I tap and listen," "I tell them," "I say"). One paraphrase loop: "Patience used to be a queue toward oblivion" is immediately restated as "Now it is the careful press I make against each creak." These do not obscure causality but dull momentum slightly. No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats; the child rescue and storm are concretely rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high (letter edge, map, graft metaphor interwoven). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. However, figurative density is relentless—nearly every sentence carries a simile or metaphor ("wine cellar holding its breath," "courage from gravel," "net catching air")—without pattern-teaching or payoff. In peak beats (revealing the letter, the traveler kneeling), the figurative load dilutes immediacy rather than sharpening it. Apply −0.5 for density without escalation, −0.2 for register drift in final third ("verdicts loosen").

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines do two jobs (world-building, atmosphere, ritual action). Rhythm varies purposefully with longer contemplative sentences and short declarative beats ("We recite the litany"). Minor template-cadence issue: several adjacent paragraphs open with prepositional or temporal phrases ("In this place," "In the sand's underbody," "Into it we pour," "Inside that hush"), creating light scaffold. The metaphor "like a creek hiding under planks" is concrete and apt; "toeing out ridgelines" is specific to the walker's task. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; one mixed construction ("balance on weather itself" after "toeing out ridgelines") introduces slight vehicle drift. The artifacts do not touch closure, so penalty remains modest (−0.4 for template stems). High density and clean propulsion keep the score in strong territory.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies across beats with purposeful compression ("We test the route by placing the photographs along the field rows") and lyric expansion ("as vines climb the factory walls, as vines climb the fences, as vines climb the old ideas"). Clarity holds but sentence openings show modest stem repetition: "I said," "I asked," "I note," "I slide." One paraphrase loop: the vines-climb refrain recurs without added pressure mid-scene. Figurative density ("wind smelled like old engines and moonlight," "stories need coaxing through gentle patterns") elevates texture but risks overwriting in a few beats ("relief often sounds like a bell testing its own metal"). Information density is high; most lines do two jobs, though the essayistic turns occasionally abstract away from scene immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("language itself has climbed into the rafters," "words...will crawl the margins like vines"), creating texture but occasionally slowing momentum in non-peak beats. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("suspended hush" recurs three times with slight variation; "growth" and "pattern" churn synonyms). Template cadence runs ("He lifts...He tilts...He moves...He adds") in the middle third reduce variety. Information density is strong; most lines do double work. No major clarity breaks, but the lyric register and metaphor stacking in high-pressure beats (cards, crystal tilts) trigger −0.5 for density without full payoff and −0.3 for template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high—"fog folded his words," "salt-thread pulling from him like a tide," "laughter wearing a limp"—and largely coherent, though occasional vehicles clash: "filament humming between ribs, a taut string of age" mixes electrical and musical metaphors without resolution. Paraphrase loops appear: lines 8–9 restate the listening act ("pressed his ear to hear the whispering age" / "wanted to capture the sound of growing older"), and lines 27–28 recycle the idea of whispered years without added pressure. Template cadence in "He [verb]" stems across multiple paragraphs (noted in Q6) dull propulsion. Information density is moderate; several beats (chalk pocket-drop and retrieval, videotape mentions) advance atmosphere without tightening stakes. Strengths: vocabulary is specific ("barnacled eyelids," "plinth," "gull-braid"), and the final paragraph's rhythm supports closure without loop artifacts. Applying artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5, mixed metaphor −0.3 = baseline ~7.6, reduced to 6.9 under accumulation cap.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences layer action, setting, and interiority. Rhythm varies purposefully, slowing for tuning beats, quickening at the image-click moment. A few near-loops touch Q7 limits: "changelessly constant" echoed twice within three paragraphs, and the leaf-falling motif restated four times without always adding new pressure. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "burn scar" Moon, "trapped mayfly" hand, "flake of doubt" burr work well. One mixed vehicle: "pale claws" for tides then "shy shadows" for ridges feels register-inconsistent. No template cadence or filter stacks. Closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high across most beats (each image does double work: clementine = scent of hope, shard = memory's edge). A minor pattern emerges in mid-section lines that open with "He/The son [verb]" and "I [verb]" across several adjacent sentences, creating a mild template cadence that does not touch closure but reduces propulsion in the middle third. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("light pools…like water," "breath holds like a question"); one mixed vehicle: "room holds the last note like a vow" (sonic metaphor shifts to social contract without clear bridge). No paraphrase loops or major scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "They said utensils remembered old tremors" establishes world rules and primes the scholar's question). Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives accelerate ("I traced a line," "I exhaled") while longer constructions breathe during reflection. Minor loop detected: "quietly deliberate" appears three times with near-identical phrasing. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one minor muddle: "moon a slow-breathing clerk tallying silences by hand" slightly overwrites. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot without padding. Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language ("smoke," "minerals," "constellations") is compressed and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; sentence openings vary cleanly. Minor filter-verb presence ("I saw," "I felt") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy. The read-aloud test passes: "After the substitute body is found, a cleft in certainty opens under every step" shifts from exposition to embodied perception smoothly, and the final paragraph's syntactic variation ("careful," "learning," "bright bones") creates visual rhythm without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with purposeful figurative language: "compass inside my chest," "lantern made of patience and tide." Rhythm varies (short declaratives alternate with longer accumulative clauses). Some minor template cadence in mid-section ("I pick... I circle... I set...") but not pervasive enough to trigger heavy penalty. Zero paraphrase loops; sentences advance. Clarity and momentum remain strong. "Reflectively vibrant" reads slightly ornamental in isolation but is integrated through the polishing arc. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high across most beats. Strong images: "Geiger counter under my ribs," "roof once wept," "moss gossiping in a green undertone." Paraphrase loop appears: "I did not answer; I am quietly proactive in different ways" restates without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence runs in the burial sequence: "She kneels too… She lowers… She says…" (−0.4). A few figurative constructions in high-pressure beats border on opacity: "promise being unmade" and "grammar of permission lifts its face" work but slow momentum slightly. Closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies, with some strong imagistic compression ("mist held its breath," "river owning its braided refusal"). Information density is high in places. However, several paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 5–6 restate the protagonist's motive with synonym churn ("collect the shapes," "quiet forms that could stand," "fragments too"). Template cadence runs in the cameo sequence: "A courier… A grandmother… A child…" across three paragraphs with identical stems. Filter-verb stacks in reflective passages ("I told," "I watched," "I felt") dull immediacy. Metaphors occasionally clash: "thickened like ink settling, a legible silence waiting for lines" mixes visual and auditory in a way that strains coherence. Apply paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence (−0.5), and mixed-metaphor (−0.4) penalties in Q7; total core deduction ~−1.1, plus artifacts touch mid-section → disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile ("time loosen," "doubts softened like bread," "moon lowered its chin"). Mixed vehicles appear: the moon "listening like a teacher" anthropomorphizes while "fat with memory but careful with its light" mixes culinary and optical metaphors without coherent logic. Paraphrase loops recur: "spins golden stories" (line 3), "Spinning stories into the chords" (line 28), and "stories gilded the air, a filament of patient light" (line 12) restate the same image. Template stems cluster: "He said," "He taught," "He knelt," "Rowen said" across adjacent lines. Filter-verb stacks appear in peak beats ("I felt the grove agree," "I felt time loosen," "I understood that repair"). Applying patterned-artifact penalties: paraphrase loop −0.3, template cadence −0.4, figurative muddle in closure third −0.6, filter stacks −0.5 = cumulative −1.8 deduction from a mid-7 baseline. Disallow 9+ globally per artifact-in-final-third rule.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("branches like ribs," "sap frozen mid-throb," "steam trapped under ice like breath under a sleeping child's quilt," "emerald crumbs in a white mouth that would not swallow"), approaching overwriting in several beats where metaphor appears in most consecutive sentences without clear pattern payoff. Mixed metaphor check: "canvas of errands, which was the ground itself" reads strained; "orchard's hearts beat into lines" mixes anatomical and cartographic vehicles without clear coherence. Sentence openings vary; information density is strong, with most lines advancing image or action. Loop check: "He had waited then, and he waited now, demonstrating patience physically again" is a near-paraphrase of the earlier patience demonstration, applying −0.2. Template cadence is avoided. No major scaffold or pronoun drift, but the lyricism occasionally prioritizes texture over propulsion, slowing momentum in the middle third (plate listening, ampoule unsealing) where a single tightening image could replace two.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with minimal scaffold. The figurative language ("spring uncoiled like a memory refusing chronology," "words would ricocade and soften, like fruit ripening in shade") is consistently voice-motivated and fits the reflective locksmith's idiom. Small deductions: a few adjacent lines restate without added pressure ("He wanted to store wonder...and unlock it when needed" immediately after the harvest-of-echoes setup). Template cadence appears in the day-by-day beats ("At morning...At noon...Evening") but reads intentional. One paraphrase loop in the final third: "not to own it, but to test the safekeeping" echoes the earlier harvest intent without clear escalation. Apply −0.4 for loops.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("the city above wore a shingled hush, roofs of silence overlapping like scales on a dreaming fish"), but several metaphors stack without clarifying action: "boundary-lessly trapped" as both attribute and sensation, "whalebone reverie" as tone descriptor. Template cadence appears in paired constructions ("I lifted it... I wrote its new weight... My hand trembled") without variation. Paraphrase loops surface ("weights would yield willingly" / "how pain stacks or slides" / "how each load wants to rest") across adjacent beats. The closure line is clean and propulsive, but figurative muddle in mid-beats and repetitive stems lower momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally, information density is high (most lines do multiple jobs: "Steam ropes the air" = sensory + time marker + mood). Strong figurative control: "ropes hang like molted skins," "whistle tests itself like a child at a door." Overwriting friction: figurative language appears in most sentences of high-density beats without always advancing pressure—"rust-hued peace lifts…and lays its weight" is lovely but the vehicle ("lifts…lays") contradicts itself slightly. Template-cadence check flags minor stem repetition ("She [verb]…She [verb]") in middle paragraph but not enough to trigger full penalty. No loops or scaffolding. The final image propels cleanly. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; metaphoric density is high but largely coherent ("rope of murmurs," "click our truce into place"). Information density is strong—most lines do multiple jobs (image, pressure, theme). However, paraphrase loops appear: "I am chronologically confused, or maybe the hours are" echoes "It is chronologically confused too" without added pressure. Template cadence runs: "I admit... I forgive... I promise... I stay" reads like checklist phrasing. Some register drift ("syncopation of possible days") elevates diction past the scavenger's grounded voice. Figurative saturation in the middle third ("barnacles," "turbine sighs," "translucent leaves") risks overwriting without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high—most lines advance setting, choice, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully: short declarative sentences during diagnostic work ("The flows were wrong") shift to longer cumulative cadences at closure. Minor scaffold issues: "intentions had diverged" and "the building was following ghosts" restate the same idea within three lines (−0.2 paraphrase loop). A few figurative constructions cluster in the opening third ("windows mirrored dusk like paused galaxies," "silence took inventory") but remain legible and voice-consistent. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs; propulsion stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high and often striking—"origami thunder," "tide before surge"—but some metaphors blur sense: "floors that remembered every footfall" and "crystal whispering forecourt after rain" are poetic but the mechanics remain vague. Paraphrase loops: "he had promised himself…In that vow he heard" restates intent across adjacent lines. Template cadence: "He carried…He stepped…He sat…He wrote…He thought…He had needed…He looked up…He whispered…He would not…He gathered…He did not…" runs through much of the piece without taught pattern. Clarity is never fully lost, but the density and loops dull momentum in the middle third. Apply −0.8 for template cadence + paraphrase loops; no artifact touches closure directly but spread is pervasive.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs. However, figurative language clusters densely in several beats without clear pattern-teaching: "parchment ribbon," "architecture of lies that ribbed our districts like concealed bracing," "tide… lifting everything in me to the same calm level" within close proximity. Minor template cadence appears in repeated "I [verb]" openings across the middle section. The closure beat is clean, and no paraphrase loops obscure causality, but the overwriting in high-pressure moments (retrieval, revelation) applies a −0.6 deduction for density and coherence friction combined.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high and often purposeful—"lightning-made root of sand," "knots brightened like constellations"—but several metaphors feel stacked without clear payoff: "memory itself had a color I could weigh" adds texture but not information. Paraphrase loops appear: the weavers are introduced as those who "did not speak in words, but in knots," then re-explained as neighbors "passing knowledge along the pier where marrow recognizes tide." Template cadence in the knot-reading sequence ("A clove hitch held... A bowline spoke... Even the frayed end kept counsel") creates rhythmic monotony. Sentence openings vary, but the momentum remains steady rather than propulsive; no beat accelerates or tightens. Clarity is intact, yet the prose prioritizes lyricism over density and forward drive.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often purposeful ("lonesome splendor," "intimate geometry"), but some images clash or over-elaborate: "eyes are archives of low tides" and "wavering light" stacks metaphors without clear vehicle coherence. Paraphrase loops appear: "the season is always now" and "I work here because grief has seasonality" restate adjacently. Template cadence in the middle third ("He tells me... I understand... I write...") flattens momentum. The closure image is vivid and artifact-free, limiting total penalty to −0.8 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("heart a metronome of quaking reverie," "egg cracked...in petals," "rust grew petals, and gears learned to hesitate"), but several mixed or strained metaphors appear ("wings that did not wound," "lineage tilt," "tremor learned to speak"). Template cadence runs pervade: multiple sentences open with "He" + past-tense verb, and "The" + noun + verb structures repeat across paragraphs without pattern payoff. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the accumulation of elevated modifiers in peak beats (hatch, final image) dilutes propulsion. Information density is moderate; many lines do two jobs (image + thematic charge), but scaffolding phrases like "He realized" and "He wondered whether" slow momentum. Apply artifact deduction −0.8 for template cadence and figurative muddle in closure vicinity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied, with strong concrete nouns (obsidian, kelp-drift, sea lettuce) and minimal filter verbs. Information density is high in ritual beats (coin-swing, sand-sprinkling, grafting). However, paraphrase loops appear in the middle third ("she wanted to prove… if water could turn glass… then her town could hold") and the final paragraph restates the tide-engine metaphor without added pressure. Template cadence runs through several lines ("She came because… She found… She stepped… She did not accuse"), and the phrase "unyielding compassion" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment. No artifacts touch the closure beat, so high-band entry remains possible, but the loops and scaffolding reduce propulsion in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies well, and imagery is dense and purposeful. Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, stakes, or thematic texture. However, the piece carries pervasive figurative language and elevated diction without sufficient anchor in concrete action beats, creating occasional opacity ("breadcrumbs you cannot see alone," "evaporating silver") that slows momentum in the middle third. Paraphrase loops appear: "sidereal patience" recurs three times in similar phrasing, and "defiant hush" bookends without evolution. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks, but the density of metaphor in high-pressure beats (broker confrontation, fountain unlocking) approaches overwriting without full clarity payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines layer world, character, and theme. Rhythm varies purposefully with paragraph length and sentence structure. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "echoes return like birds who know the window" and later "I collect the echoes they leave, kin to the first I cast" restate the sonar concept without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in mid-section: "They think... I know..." / "They expect... I offer..." runs across adjacent beats (−0.4). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "moonmilk" and "veined maps" work, though "orchard of nebulas" stretches spatial logic slightly. No scaffold or stock metaphor strings in peak beats. Propulsion is steady; the final paragraph's recursion serves closure rather than stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high (most lines do two jobs). However, figurative density in high-pressure beats risks overwriting: "spectral mentorship sharper than any chisel," "butterflies…a drifting congregation reminding me the work must stretch across the butterfly migration," "their feet were commas trembling with the authority of mercy." Three metaphor-heavy constructions cluster near closure without clear pattern payoff. Template cadence appears in mid-section ("She had taught me…," "While I carved…," "As the weeks traveled…") across adjacent paragraphs. Apply −0.6 for density + −0.4 for template stems = −1.0 total in Q7, plus disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create purposeful cadence shifts (short bursts at the pause, longer breath at the fisherman meeting). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Clarity is strong, though a few figurative constructions require re-reading: "the tidal obsidian ridge inside the tower, the black glass heaving through the timbers" (is this literal or perceptual?). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Deductions: figurative density in the middle third approaches saturation—"drowned monograms," "wake we carry," "hot wire," "solder's spark," "bread cooling" in quick succession—without full pattern-teaching. The mix of nautical, electrical, and thermal metaphors muddies coherence slightly. No filter-verb stacks. Propulsion is strong; the final paragraph lands cleanly. Minor syntactic uniformity in mid-section (several "I see…" stems), but variety overall is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("velvet unwinding," "a choir that never finished learning the hymn it loves," "maze of funerary plots mapped in thread") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating overwriting in non-peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "He listens, then taps… and the echoes answer" followed immediately by "He imagines the dead woman" without causal link. Template cadence runs dominate the middle third ("He climbs… He begins… He climbs down… He kneels"). Pronoun references remain clear, but information density is diluted by ornamental metaphor. These artifacts spread across the text, triggering cumulative deductions and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings show range. Information density is high in modeling passages ("tiles, threads, and glass beads of probability") and imagery (kingfisher, prism lamp). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor deductions: filter-verb clusters in reflective blocks ("I see the market I never visit, the language I never learned, the fear") slightly dull immediacy, and a few lines lean toward stock metaphor ("rivers of flight," "ocean of deliberate blankness"). The final beat is clean and propulsive, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, stakes, or the dust-to-language transformation. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent: "voice arrived sideways, as if translated by a wary hallway," "refrain named a silence." Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor template cadence appears in the mid-section ("They wrote the day... They wrote the night... They wrote the absence") but serves anaphoric emphasis rather than artifactual drift. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. One brief register drift: "choreography for grit" reads slightly elevated against the otherwise grounded idiom, but does not obscure causality. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively. Grammar and tense remain stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift between short declarations and longer subordinate structures. Information density is high—most lines advance character, image, or stakes. Figurative language ("moon cannot find her," "dust sighs up as paper dust") is coherent and voice-motivated. Two frictions: the phrase "the mirage of safety, which is the only honest thing I have ever named" edges toward thematic statement rather than image, and "as the old rocking chair finally slows to a stop" appears identically in the opening and closing, creating a frame that some may read as lyric payoff but risks minor template cadence. No loops or scaffold; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines do double work (e.g., "the salt writes its own index" advances setting, theme, and tone). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs touch the closure beat. Figurative language is controlled and grounded ("silt humps rose like sleeping whales," "an artery the city had forgotten"), with no mixed metaphors. Minor density slip in the opening third: "I am a wannabe philosopher…I fail upward into questions" risks pose over propulsion, and "They call me rationally rebellious as an insult, but I treat it like a set of clean tools" flirts with thesis statement. The closure image ("a body finding its lungs," the wheel catching) is vivid and carries no artifact. Overall momentum strong, but early scaffold prevents 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, with many lines doing double work (image + character stance). However, overwriting and mixed metaphors accumulate: "autumn folded itself against the velvet library as if the season were a hush made visible" is figuratively dense without clear payoff; "talk leaves behind" mixes vehicle and tenor; "the rosette slipped" lacks spatial logic (from where?). Template-cadence runs appear ("I placed," "I said," "I told," "I watched") and paraphrase loops touch adjacent lines ("We sang three songs... Rafi took the melody... The old guard lowered"). These artifacts dull momentum in the final third and touch the closure beat, triggering −0.8 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense, with sentences often doing double duty (sensory + memory + choice). Some figurative language borders on overwriting—"shadows curved like commas waiting for their sentence," "alignment brightened with a color human tongues never name"—and a few lines risk metaphor muddle without full payoff. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and the final beats avoid scaffold. Minor deduction for density of figurative language in middle beats that occasionally slows momentum, though the closure image ("soup the color of old copper") lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., "I had kept it hidden, not from law, but from those who rushed without reverence" advances character and stakes). Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "Truth spoke ahead of me, as usual, as if it had rented my lungs. / I wanted the right listener, I said" restates agency without adding pressure (paraphrase loop, −0.2). One metaphor leans strained: "nectar dusk draped... like slow honey cooling on a spoon" mixes nectar/honey/draping/cooling in ways that blur vehicle coherence (−0.3). No major loops or template runs. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    High figurative density ("tide slurred the pebbles," "rooms remember," "shutters stiff as bitten lips") risks overwriting but largely stays legible and voice-motivated. Some loops appear: "creeping normality" echoed in "creeping normality rehearsed," "breathe" repeated across opening paragraphs. Template cadence in places: "I [verb], and [result]" pattern runs through several beats. Information density is strong (most lines do multiple jobs), and rhythm modulates purposefully between observation and interaction. Proofreading clean, no major clarity breaks, but the accumulation of metaphor in every sentence of some beats (-0.4) and mild scaffold loops (-0.3) prevent higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (silt as breath, eelgrass whispering) stays coherent and voice-motivated. Information density is high: most lines advance situation or deepen the revelation cascade. Minor artifact: the phrase "incisively kind" recurs three times, one instance feeling slightly template-like rather than organically deployed. Paraphrase check passes cleanly—no synonym loops. The final image recharges foxglove-stained glass and benches without overwriting. Propulsion remains clear through threading actions, avoiding scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but coherent ("boundless confinement," "breath on a mirror that never clears," "the grain of the missed"). Information density is high; nearly every line advances the proof metaphor, the missed opportunity, or the staircase's physics. Minor issues: a few near-paraphrases in the middle third ("I note the result and adjust the constants" / "Proof resumes, and the climb resumes") and one template stem run ("I say... The slot closes... I note"). No loops or scaffolding touch the closure beat. Syntax modulates with pressure (short declaratives at the rupture, longer cadences at the final proof). Overwriting is borderline in the middle (multiple metaphors per sentence), but the pattern is taught early and pays off, so no heavy penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several beats show overwriting: "The rooftop greenhouse breathed a saffron quiet" stacks metaphor and synaesthesia; "syllables falling like beads, reshaping the air around their wares" mixes vehicles. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She painted a courier...a nurse...a boy" (list structure), and synonym loops recur ("lost languages" mentioned three times without functional shift, "saffron quiet" bookends without reweighting). Clarity remains high, but the elevated diction and figurative density in nearly every sentence of high-stakes beats (neighbor's arrival, final tea) trigger the overwriting deduction. No major scaffolding or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("history tug like a hive-slick rope," "nectar armor"). However, several lines carry metaphor overload or mixed vehicles: "limestone thaw into testimony" conflates temperature and witness; "balconies crowded with displaced persons staring through the emerald-tinted lens" in the dream is spatially unclear; "corridors stitched" by vows strains the image. Template cadence appears in mid-section paragraph openings ("I began with," "I told her of," "I wrote histories"). The density is high, but clarity wobbles in peak beats (the vow ceremony and dream sequence), applying a −0.6 deduction for figurative muddle and template stems across multiple high-pressure lines.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Figurative density is high but mostly purposeful, with metaphors tied to clockwork and tide. Rhythm varies and information density is strong—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Deductions: several near-paraphrase loops ("hunger stone" described multiple times with similar syntax; "the yoyo dropped / hung / climbed" beats slightly redundant in function), and stacked metaphors in the vision sequence risk muddling clarity ("threads…humming with hushed catastrophe," "blade of fog"). These artifacts appear mid-story but do not obscure the closure image. Baseline −0.6 for template cadence and loop presence; −0.2 for mild figurative muddle in one high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with short declaratives alternating with longer, metaphor-dense lines. Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances situation, character, or atmosphere. Strong verb choices and specific nouns dominate ("hauled you back by the throat of your fear," "corridor spit up the shape of a shadow"). Minor overwriting in the middle third: "photographically cursed" concept is restated multiple times without additional pressure, and a few lines edge toward decorative lushness ("every tear showed me another angle of myself losing a bet") that slows momentum. No loops, clean grammar, vivid metaphors remain coherent. The final line propels cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance action, world logic, or sonic method. Minor deductions: occasional figurative stacking without clear vehicle logic ("dusk grinding indigo," "foam teaching itself borders") and some template stems ("I dubbed," "I struck," "I set") create mild cadence repetition in the middle third. No paraphrase loops or major clarity loss. Propulsion remains strong, and the final line lands cleanly with no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (image, world-rule, character motive). Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives during action ("I freeze"), longer accretions during reflection. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor ding: occasional figurative density in non-peak beats ("like sunflowers that prefer the shadow," "thinned into silence") slows momentum slightly, though the metaphors remain coherent and do not obscure causality. Closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Figurative density is high but mostly legible: "station is a long throat of shadow," "noble lies…taste like sleep," "schedules ran on secrecy, and secrecy ran over the quiet." One metaphor stumbles—"platforms throatless" after "long throat of shadow" creates vehicle drift. Some paraphrase loops: "I recapture not only the documents but the exact tilt of a man" echoes the prior beat's "recapture a moment that was stolen." Sentence stems vary, and information density stays strong (most lines do double work). The rhetorical questions mid-piece ("What do I owe the living, and what do I owe the dead") risk slowing the beat but serve thematic layering. Propulsion holds through clarity and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives ("I did not come merely to measure") anchor longer appositive cascades—and information density is high. Several lines do multiple jobs: "Its lid snaps like a small lighthouse shutting its eye, and I feel the hush between clicks as a charted current" advances atmosphere, character sensibility, and the inkwell's thematic role. Deductions: "Stoically Sensitive" and "Interlaced absence" are capitalized and repeated label-fashion (−0.3); a few phrases border purple without added clarity ("moon misplace itself in a glass, half in jest, half in dread"). No paraphrase loops or major scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "bone-dry from neglect despite its swollen lips" conveys state, history, contradiction). Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings shift, no paraphrase loops detected. Figurative language is thick ("stone lung schooling itself to breathe less," "towers rolled on hidden bearings") but coherent within the submerged-archive idiom. Minor concern: density approaches ornamental in a few beats (e.g., "dappled resolve lacquered onto every spine") where metaphor stacks without advancing pressure—this flirts with overwriting but remains legible and voice-consistent. No scaffold, loops, or template cadence. Propulsion is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.2)
    Density is high and most lines advance atmosphere or ritual, but several figurative constructions muddle clarity: "seeding his lungs with color," "vapor and glass…brew the cranes," "messages transform from tight creases into air, and then into change" (three-step abstraction). Template cadence appears in mid-section ("He polishes because…"; "He selects…fits…drinks"; "He tells…She instructs…So he steeps") with repetitive "He [verb]" stems across multiple sentences, triggering −0.5 in Q7. Paraphrase loop: "luminous torment wrapped in patient hands" echoed by "to fold grief into origami cranes" without added detail (−0.2). No scaffolding or outright loops touch the closure beat, preventing deeper penalty. Rhythm varies and read-aloud ear is generally strong, but the figurative density in middle beats slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines layer image, action, and theme ("Light falls through it like rain through cathedral ruins, finding edges where edges were not"). Sentence openings vary, and the read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor loop: "unused potential pools" recurs across three beats with near-identical phrasing without added pressure; the figurative register is consistently elevated but never muddles sense. No causality breaks or scaffold drag; the Text Artifact Screen finds minimal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; most sentences advance image or action. Two paraphrase loops: "perpetually surprised" recycled across three beats without functional change; "missing pieces" appears in map description, printout blanks, and final paragraph with synonym churn (gaps/absence/blanks) rather than reweighted meaning. Filter-verb stack in one high-pressure beat: "I recognize," "I realize," "I adjust," "I confess" flattens immediacy. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "letters and orbits were relatives who stopped using last names" and "tucked it under their tongue as if storing thunder" serve voice without muddle. Minor template cadence: repeated "The [noun] [verb]" openings across five paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high ("I had been deep in the story all along, the absent witness"). Opening and closing lines are resonant. However, paraphrase loops appear: "I told her how I forged the planks" / "I told her I had spent years trying to quell attention" restates confession across adjacent beats. Template cadence emerges in the final third with repeated "we will" constructions and a cluster of abstract nouns ("tempered regret," "climate," "inheritance") that dilute concreteness. No major clarity break, but momentum sags slightly before recovery at the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or conflict. Rhythm varies purposefully, slowing for reflection ("between apology and forgiveness there is a narrow weather") and tightening for action beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Two issues prevent higher score: "furrowed hush" appears twice (opening and closure), reading as light echo rather than purposeful reprise; and the metaphor density in the opening paragraph ("wind combed," "spine of stone," "loose thought can topple") approaches overwriting without quite breaking legibility. Closure beats remain clean.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer reflective lines contracting to short, urgent beats during the rescue ("We found his father aground in the eelgrass, engine lifted, wrists shining with sweat"). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. However, paraphrase loops appear: "I carried the astronomical compass because it once steadied me" is echoed by "Now its brass face only reflected a jittery mouth," restating doubt without added pressure. Template cadence runs cluster in the opening third ("I stood," "I laughed," "I launched," "I had," "I did"). Figurative density is high throughout ("expectations collapse... like planks easing from a dock," "faith flickering in the pupils like a harbor light") but remains coherent and voice-motivated. The loops and template stems warrant deduction but do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, and the read-aloud test passes. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "I chose to stay, to learn the channels, to ferry the reluctant" restates the decision just articulated, and "After the procedure" bookends create symmetry without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in mid-story beats ("Every door opened…every paddle stroke drew…") but does not obscure causality. No loops touch the closure image directly.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances image, grief, or the conjuring ritual. Figurative language is dense ("wind braids itself with steam," "scent-keeper," "mouth that exhales what the orchard longs to tell the dead") and mostly coherent, though occasional mixed vehicles appear: "reluctant as dawn behind a mountain" pairs oddly with "a heat that is not only memory but instruction." Paraphrase loops are minimal, but template cadence emerges in mid-section beats: "I [verb]…and [noun] [verb]" structures repeat across adjacent lines without taught pattern. No filter-verb stacks or major scaffold, but the sheer density of metaphor in every sentence risks overwriting without clear payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Rhythm varies naturally with pressure: shorter declaratives at peak confession ("I pressed my palm into the cloth and spoke water"), longer lyric sentences in framing. Minor deductions: "choking beauty" recurs without added pressure (−0.2); "willingly perplexed" is restated conceptually rather than dramatized in one beat (−0.2). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "clouds like curtains" followed by "clouds...like scales" risks minor vehicle drift but remains legible. No paraphrase loops; propulsion is clean. Strong opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances stake or image. Sentence openings vary and the read-aloud rhythm modulates well. Two artifact clusters: paraphrase loop in the middle third (the "compassion without its shadow is brittle" beat restates prior interiority without added pressure) and a brief synonym run when describing the chamber contents ("seeds and sleeping words," "blueprint for a conversation," "library," "catalog" in rapid succession). The stock metaphor "moths" for futures feels generic. Minor filter-verb stack ("I felt myself lighten," "I felt joy rise") in the closure sequence reduces immediacy slightly. No loops touch the final beat directly, so closure clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing character, setting, or stakes. Two paraphrase loops: "a vibrant hush that promised permission" / "rumor that when the sea fell silent"; "once she had placed two chairs" / "she could not feed everyone with money anymore" recycles the philanthropist trait without added pressure. Figurative language (driftwood-as-raft, mountain-as-animal) is mostly coherent, though "sheet of ash that curtained stars" strains under the "without panic" modifier. No scaffold or template cadence. Minor clarity slip: "letting desire drift into prearranged paths" abstracts the mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.9)
    High figurative density without obvious template loops. Some lines layer jobs well: "medals dreaming of their own reflections" economically conveys Rhun's vanity. However, metaphoric vehicles occasionally collide—"winking hush with a bite" mixes sight, sound, and taste without clear anchor. Repeated phrase structures ("It is X, who…") and the stem "I [verb]" appear frequently. Minor paraphrase loop: "silence revolution" restated as "consent of doors" without added pressure. No scaffold artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Two minor issues: (1) metaphor density in the opening third ("sea sang like wire," "sketch of glimmers," "tone of borrowed dawn," "horizon hesitate") stacks without clear escalation or pattern payoff, trending toward decorative; (2) a few lines loop conceptually ("numbers we had sown sprouted points where motion could rest" echoes "sequences persuaded motion to become meaning"). Information density is high and propulsion clear. No scaffolding or template cadence. The final image recharges prior rock/pattern motifs effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff: "storm-kissed wonder," "night-blooming atlas," "alleyways like sutures, highways like lightning that refused to leave." Mixed metaphors appear ("storm stepping back to the horizon" after "listening," "arterial lines" for city wounds). Paraphrase loops recur: the phrase "furiously tranquil" appears three times with minimal reweighting. Template cadence runs dominate: "They [verb]... they [verb]... their [noun]" structures stack across paragraphs. Applying density (−0.5), coherence (−0.5), and loop penalties (−0.4) totals approximately −1.4 in Q7, with artifacts touching the closure beat (final tracing gesture) disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm and syntax vary purposefully, and imagery is concrete ("foil wrapped in a newspaper like a long bread roll," "warm air rose...smelling of rain on chalk and apple cores"). Clarity is generally high. However, figurative density approaches saturation in several paragraphs—nearly every sentence in the opening third carries a metaphor or simile—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, risking ornamental accumulation. A few constructions slip toward purple register ("sequins," "the room returned to dignified chaos; glass threw sequins, the brook confided, and we breathed like metronomes adopting jazz") that momentarily prioritizes lyricism over propulsion. No major loops or scaffold, but information density occasionally dips when metaphor restates rather than advances.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every line—"rain and iron," "bodies exhale," "moon clears the skyline," "skyline has teeth marks"—creating cumulative texture but also raising density concerns. Several paraphrase loops appear: "molts personalities monthly, shedding faces like ticket stubs" and later "If I molt tomorrow, let the next self remember"; "Books breathe like sleeping beasts" and "stacks stop feeling like bones and start feeling like ribs." Template cadence runs of "We [verb]" appear in the middle third without clear payoff. No clarity breaks at closure, but the saturation and loops trigger −0.6 under the artifact pack, and the repetitive stems add −0.4, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines layer action, atmosphere, and metaphor. Figurative language is dense ("tide rose in the sky," "paths rearranged beneath the swell, as if choices were kelp") and occasionally stacks without clear propulsion, risking ornament over momentum in the arbor-heart sequence. A few near-paraphrases appear: "he played against it with gentle insistence" and "If he could hold the arbor attention" restate resistance without added pressure. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Grammar and syntax are clean, and no loops or scaffolding obscure causality. The figurative density in peak beats (the performance) is pattern-taught and mostly coherent, though "choices were kelp" and simultaneous tide/wind/compass imagery blur into decorative texture at moments.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify. Information density is high: most lines layer image, action, and conceptual weight ("It fell as punctuation, not erasure, a series of commas sewing breath into the ridge"). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, controlled by the narrator's voice. Minor issues: "bruise of approaching rain" / "patient fist of water" within four lines nudges toward stacked metaphor; "luminous doubt made space for careful courage, the kind that kneels before it decides" edges on abstraction without concrete embodiment. "The seed drank the remembering and sprouted a thread of light that hummed like tide in a shell" is vivid but vehicles (drinking, thread, hum) don't fully cohere. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; line-level propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is consistent with the tutor's idiom. However, the phrase "rhythmically placid" appears four times, creating a motif loop that edges toward decorative recurrence rather than evolving pressure. "Tides of remembrance" recurs similarly without shifting function. The opening and closing frame the compass and lace cleanly, but mid-passage sentences occasionally stack metaphors without clear propulsion: "Colors began to diffuse…bleached apologies, pale moons, a shy bruise, and then a glow" lists rather than dramatizes. Paraphrase check: "I spoke…I said the words I should have said" restates without added detail. Line-level control is strong but not flawless; apply −0.6 for patterned loops and −0.3 for mild paraphrase, totaling −0.9, lowering from ~7.7 base to 6.8.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense yet largely precise, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“the compost barrels hummed an earthy arithmetic of survival” is representative). Figurative language is sustained but coherent; metaphors of data, dust, and gradual processes interlock rather than clutter. There are no visible loops, scaffolding phrases, or rhythm artifacts, and the final images are sharp and legible. A few sentences verge on over-packed abstraction, but they do not materially slow momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: varied syntax, clean grammar, and high information density, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors are inventive yet coherent (annealing, kiln of listening, frost as writing) and avoid major mixed-image confusion. There are very few scaffold or paraphrase loops, and momentum is maintained despite reflective texture. The sheer frequency of figurative phrasing occasionally risks slight saturation, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is very strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and figurative language that mostly sharpens rather than blurs (“store winter like a library stores breath,” “a nation of wrong readings”). There is sustained metaphorical richness, but it rarely tips into muddle or redundancy, and sentences generally do more than one job at once. Cadence and paragraphing help momentum rather than stall it, even in reflective passages. A few abstractions could arguably be pared, but they don’t significantly dull the closure or obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and musical, with high information load per sentence and frequent figurative language that usually pulls triple duty (advancing world, emotion, and theme simultaneously). The rhythm varies enough to avoid mechanical cadence, and there’s very little scaffolding or paraphrase; most lines earn their keep. At moments the metaphor saturation (“chased stillness,” “water slackens like a vow kept,” “routes the current honors”) edges toward purple and might, for some readers, blur rather than sharpen pressure, which keeps it just short of flawless at a top-tier standard. Nonetheless, clarity at the climax and ending remains intact, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence-level craft is excellent: varied rhythms, high information density, and figurative language that rarely strains (“scarcity, when braided with care, could become a braid strong enough to lift a season”). There’s no detectable scaffolding, synonym loops, or template cadence; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or thematic weight. The prose leans lyrical but remains clear, especially in high-pressure beats like the patrol’s arrival. A few images come close to poetic saturation, yet they stay coherent and do not obscure action or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is lush yet mostly controlled; nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (image, theme, and emotional progression) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative density is high but surprisingly coherent, with light/breath/river/metaphors interlocking instead of clashing. There are no major clarity lapses despite the lyricism, and the final third maintains precision (“I do not spill or drown; I decant”) without muddying the closure. Some readers might find the relentless metaphor slightly saturating, but it doesn’t measurably harm momentum or sense.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush and figurative in nearly every line, yet the imagery is largely coherent and multi-functional, advancing setting, psychology, and theme simultaneously. Sentences tend to be information-dense without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and the rhythmic modulation (e.g., short declaratives amidst long, braided sentences) prevents monotony. A lesser version of this style would slide into purple prose, but here most metaphors (“a harp of blackened ribs,” “paths elongate into whispers”) feel precise rather than ornamental. Occasional metaphor saturation edges toward overload but does not materially obscure causality or dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but purposeful; most metaphors are coherent and additive rather than ornamental (“dust the color of old tickets,” “rain held in jars”). There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence does two or three jobs (world, mood, and motion at once). The main ding at this level is simply saturation—almost every line is figurative, which edges close to overload in a couple of spots and slightly blurs impact. Still, clarity and momentum survive the lyric pressure, and the final image lands crisp, not muddied.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly figurative yet remains coherent; most metaphors (“blue is a far drum, green a plucked wire”) are precise, multi-functional, and advance both world and emotion. Information density is excellent: nearly every sentence contributes new nuance, and there is minimal scaffolding or repetition. The only reservation is that the unrelenting intensity of imagery risks a touch of saturation in places, which could slightly blunt impact for some readers. Still, rhythm, syntax variety, and clarity at closure are all handled at a near-publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-by-line craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most images do at least double duty (worldbuilding plus emotional charge). The figurative density is very high, but metaphors rarely mix or contradict, and they generally clarify rather than obscure; phrases like “the sky folded its burning map” and “moonbeams…like careful bees” feel precise and legible. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and transitions between beats are clean. A few lines (“air was cold with oil and stars”) edge toward purple for an already-saturated texture, which slightly dulls impact rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but purposeful, with most lines doing multiple jobs (image, theme, character) and very little scaffold or redundancy. Figurative language—“paper being forgiven,” “gentle grenades of thought,” “a lantern lighter than the dark it revealed”—is fresh and internally coherent, and it supports the accumulative texture. There is a high metaphor-per-sentence ratio that occasionally borders on overrich, but it doesn’t obscure action or closure, and rhythm remains varied and readable. No major loops, template cadences, or line-level artifacts drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and largely avoid redundancy, with most images pulling double duty for mood and character. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; there are no major mixed metaphors or purple overload, and the repetitions (“fear,” “falling,” “cast”) read as deliberate motif rather than loop. The final third maintains clarity and propulsion despite its lyricism, with no scaffolding or paraphrase cycles dulling closure. A mild constraint is that a few abstractions (“transformative betrayal,” “new certainty”) could be slightly more grounded in fresh concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double or triple duty for image, theme, and motion, and the rhythm on the page is varied and intentional. Metaphors are frequent (“spine a small, stubborn horizon,” “gold leaf bruising under rain like ripened fruit”) but largely coherent and mutually reinforcing, building a tactile mythic register rather than a tangle. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy; almost no lines could be cut without losing nuance. The only drawback, especially for elite venues, is a slight risk of saturation—imagery is so constant that a touch more sparseness at key beats might sharpen rather than blur impact.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level writing is elegant and information-dense; many sentences do double or triple duty in image, concept, and voice (“Meaning is the way the petals remember they were gears.”). Metaphors are frequent but largely coherent and thematically braided (broom, bristles, loops, frost, sound), so the lyric density supports rather than obscures understanding. There are minimal redundancies or scaffolding phrases, and rhythm varies pleasantly across the piece. At times the figurative layering approaches saturation, which risks numbing individual images, but it does not materially blur causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple burdens of setting, emotion, and theme without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The figurative language (“puddles murmuring like glass throats,” “blame pulsed like a negative”) is inventive yet coherent, and rhythm varies nicely across the piece. There is some density of imagery that might be trimmed for maximal sharpness, but it rarely muddies clarity or stalls momentum. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final cadence lands with poise rather than overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is dense but controlled; nearly every sentence advances character, world, or theme with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and non-redundant, and syntax and paragraphing provide good acoustic variety. A few images approach saturation, but they don’t blur sense or step into mixed-metaphor territory, even at the end. The closure beat is clear and uncluttered despite the lyric richness that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level writing is dense but largely disciplined: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without redundancy, and there are few, if any, true paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but coherent within its motif set (wind, ice, sideways movement) and rarely feels strained; images like “compasses ticked like trapped insects at twilight” or “a city mid-yawn” are both surprising and clear. Momentum holds despite lyricism, with no major scaffolding or filler. One could argue the prose sometimes luxuriates enough to slightly mute urgency, but it does not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is highly accomplished: dense images do multiple jobs, and most sentences push both atmosphere and narrative forward. A few moments verge on over-saturation or repetition (e.g., “Water damage creating images” echoes) and the figurative load is consistently high, which risks slight blur. However, metaphors are internally coherent and rarely mixed, and the closure image remains sharp and legible. Overall momentum is maintained, with no major scaffold, loops, or syntactic monotony undermining the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: images are vivid yet disciplined, with most metaphors doing double or triple duty (“tea the color of rain charts,” “towers with tired knees,” “metronome of snow”). The prose avoids obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or thematic pressure. Density is high but coherent; figurative language is patterned and legible rather than piled-on purple. One could argue for trimming a couple of abstracted statements to let key images breathe even more, but there are no artifacts that obscure cause/effect or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, highly efficient, and usually do at least two jobs (image plus theme, or action plus emotion). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent—industrial and religious lexicons braided in ways that clarify rather than blur. There’s no noticeable scaffolding, repetition loops, or syntactic monotony; momentum is maintained even in reflective stretches. The only thing holding it shy of perfection is that density is nearly maximal, which might leave a tiny subset of readers wishing for one or two simpler breaths, but it never actually obscures causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is highly polished: images are inventive yet largely coherent, and most sentences do more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and character). Figurative density is very high, but motifs (river, roots, silence, folds) recur in controlled variations rather than drifting into incoherent purple prose. There are no obvious scaffold loops or mechanical cadences, and cause/effect remains legible despite the lyric register. A stricter economy in a few lines might sharpen impact, but the current lushness still maintains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) without bloat, and metaphors are fresh and coherent (“ravens wrote cursive in the sky,” “locket clicked open like a reluctant seashell,” “tiny iron moon of loss”). Rhythm varies organically, with no notable template cadences or paraphrase loops, and each paragraph advances mood or situation. The density of figurative language toes the line but remains controlled and legible, especially around the closure beat. There are no visible grammatical or sequencing slips, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: almost every sentence carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, theme) with tight momentum, and the figurative language, while dense, stays coherent and grounded in the story’s material lexicon (“grain spine,” “closing ledger,” “bronze quiet”). Repetition (walls listening, axis/spindle, dust/moths/ash) is purposeful rather than looped scaffolding, and there are no obvious paraphrase redundancies or mixed metaphors. The risk of purple prose is managed by consistency and clarity; images remain intelligible and support orientation rather than obscuring it. A few lines verge on ornamental, but they do not measurably dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished: sentences carry multiple functions (image, theme, character) without bloating, and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent; metaphors build a consistent maritime, luminous lexicon rather than pulling in stray registers. Momentum is maintained despite lyric density because each line advances either the plan, the world, or the evolving communal stance. A few phrases flirt with near-poetic excess, but they don’t blur sense or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line by line, the prose is remarkably tight: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and concept) without padding. Figuration is frequent but rarely feels mixed or strained; the recurring motifs of tilt, drift, and stillness stay coherent and readable. There are no noticeable scaffold phrases, synonym loops, or template cadences, and syntax varies nicely to manage pace. The density borders on lush, but clarity at peak beats (contract revelation, “one step…out of the deal,” the possession evaporating) remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is lush but mostly precise; metaphors are extended rather than stacked randomly, and almost every sentence advances character, setting, or theme simultaneously. Rhythm varies well, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding lines. The sheer density of figurative language occasionally nudges toward excess, which might test patience in a venue that prizes absolute austerity, but clarity and the closure image remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (e.g., “a loop that ends on the hour and starts on the echo”). However, figurative language is nearly continuous—“ferns opening under caustic starlight,” “runes like sleeping cicadas”—and occasionally feels stacked more for texture than pressure, risking purple prose. The insertion of terms like “procedural generation” in otherwise lyrical sentences creates mild register friction but not confusion. Momentum holds and closure is clear, yet a slight pruning of metaphors would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The figurative palette is coherent—sound/silence, bone, frost, tides, seasons—so the lushness feels designed rather than random. There are no meaningful clarity lapses or causality obscured by wording. The primary limitation is that almost every line reaches for a metaphor, which, while often beautiful, slightly blunts propulsion and could be trimmed in a few spots for maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most metaphors (“pressure fell not forward, but sideways, like outcomes choosing alleys”) are both fresh and clarifying. Repetition is pattern-driven rather than accidental (e.g., lateral progress, tranquility, pressure), and there is little scaffolding or paraphrase-looping. A few lines flirt with lushness, but the piece generally maintains momentum and clarity even in its lyric mode. Grammar and rhythm are clean, and the final cadence lands with understated precision.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and musical, imagery is rich yet mostly precise, and nearly every line pulls double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphoric language is dense (“crystal shadows cut the aisles like cooled music”), but the images are coherent and pattern-consistent rather than showy for their own sake. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; the prose keeps momentum even while being lush. A handful of lines flirt with over-ornamentation or conceptual abstraction, but they do not obscure causality or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence does double duty for image and theme, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and un-muddled, with internal logic and few, if any, mixed metaphors. There is little scaffold or repetition; ideas advance rather than circle, and the final lines efficiently re-charge earlier motifs (road, mile markers, patterning). The only restraint on a higher score is that, in aggregate, the lushness borders on purple in places, which slightly softens momentum in a few mid-paragraph stretches.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: dense, original imagery (“bananas reddened like coals at dusk,” “apples bloom white scars”) does multiple jobs without collapsing into muddle. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. The prose skirts purple but maintains clarity and forward motion, especially under the accumulative, lyric mode. Minor risk comes from the sustained metaphor load, yet it remains coherent and enhances rather than obscures the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is lush yet mostly precise, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (“Clients think that tingle is longing, which makes selling easy, though I love them for tougher reasons”). The metaphor web (static, amber, maps, herds) is coherent and sustained without obvious contradictions or loops; there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. A few spots flirt with density overload (“professionally thorough when hearts are involved,” “recipe numbered for order and mercy”) but do not materially slow momentum or blur sense. Overall rhythm and information density are strong enough for high-end publication.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, musical, and high-density: most sentences carry character, setting, and theme simultaneously (“a locket photo, worn brass blinking like a moon”). Figurative language is frequent but rarely feels muddled or redundant; metaphors are coherent within the harbor/music frame and avoid contradiction. There are no obvious scaffold loops or template cadences, and rhythm varies enough to keep the piece from turning sing-song despite its patterned motifs. The lushness approaches the upper bound of what elite editors will tolerate, but clarity and propulsion remain intact through the close.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is high: sentences tend to do multiple jobs at once, imagery is often surprising yet apt, and there is very little scaffolding or redundancy. The rhythm varies pleasingly, with longer lyric lines balanced by punchier declaratives when stakes crystallize (“I knew then what I had to dedicate, and it was not a statue, but my practice.”). The main limitation is density: figurative language is nearly continuous, occasionally risking saturation and slight softening of impact. Still, clarity and momentum are largely maintained, and no metaphor stack seriously muddies sense, keeping this firmly in the strong-to-very-strong band.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm and structure, and most do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, mood, and character all in one). Figurative language is dense but generally clean and coherent, with very few strained or mixed metaphors; repetition (“hush, rush, hush, rush”) is purposeful rather than a loop artifact. Information is conveyed economically for such a strange world, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the closure image is crisp. A handful of phrases skate near purple, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush yet mostly precise, with high information density—many lines accomplish worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once (“equations wearing festival clothes,” “clear lacquer taking fingerprints from the air”). Rhythm varies and the line-by-line flow remains clear despite frequent figurative turns; there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. However, the near-constant metaphorical pressure risks slight saturation, and a few images feel more decorative than necessary, brushing against purple without tipping into it. Given elite-publication standards, a touch more spareness around peak beats would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is lush and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and very little scaffolding or redundancy. A few moments flirt with over-embellishment or repetition—the near-duplicate clause about “while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage” reads slightly like a line-level echo rather than an intentional refrain. Despite the lyric density, clarity of action and causality is maintained, and the final sentence lands clean. Overall, the prose is publication-ready with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with figurative language that mostly feels fresh (“droplets clung to everything like second thoughts,” “it was not a tangle but a treaty”). Repetition of key phrases (“mossy trellis after rain,” “reconstruct,” “listening”) is purposeful rather than looped scaffolding. There is a high metaphor density, but it’s controlled and thematically aligned rather than purple or muddled. A very few abstractions (“sustaining transformation,” “old impulse to fix everything”) could be tightened into more concrete expressions to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is highly controlled: metaphors are vivid, surprising, and largely non-redundant, with most lines doing dual work for setting and emotion. Sentence rhythms and paragraphing provide strong momentum despite the lyric density, and there are no noticeable loops or scaffolding sentences. Imagery stays coherent (water, light, bone, grain, rust) without slipping into mixed-metaphor muddle, even in high-pressure beats like the apparition and exchange. The diction is elevated but consistently in-character for a reflective, insomniac painter, preserving clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is finely crafted, with varied syntax and high information density; most lines accomplish multiple tasks in image, mood, and world-building. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, rarely feeling like decorative excess. There are no significant loops or scaffolding sentences, and the rhythm carries momentum despite the lyric mode. A few stacked metaphors (“unseen forces spread like warmed butter… stitching crumbs of light”) flirt with over-richness, but they do not muddy causality or dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is elegant and information-dense: most sentences do at least double duty in image, theme, and motion, and the prose flows with varied rhythms and clean syntax. Metaphoric density is high, but the vehicles are coherent and mutually reinforcing (tides, ledgers, intervals, parade routes), avoiding muddle or contradiction. There’s very little scaffold or redundancy; even reflective lines advance the underlying task or reframe the stakes. A stricter rationing of figurative flourishes in one or two spots could further sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong: figurative language is dense but generally controlled, with images that extend rather than clash (arrows, constellations, rails, lanterns). Sentences are information-rich and rarely redundant; momentum carries through the highly metaphorical texture. There are moments that brush against purple prose, yet they stay intelligible and emotionally grounded, and the closure image is crisp rather than muddied. No significant scaffolding, loops, or syntactic monotony undermines the piece’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character—and very few redundancies. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, building a patterned lexicon around bodies, music, and mathematics rather than devolving into mixed metaphors. Momentum holds despite reflection, as summary compresses history into charged images (“smudged star logs, tidal scratches, griefs written sideways”). The main limitation is sheer density: the sustained lyricism flirts with overload and could benefit from a few more moments of plainer texture to sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, musical, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for world-building and theme (“storms make doors honest”; “hushed thunder is the dialect of things that are nearly born”). Imagery is abundant but generally controlled; metaphors extend coherently from the established physics of this world. There is mild risk of over-saturation—nearly every sentence is metaphor-laden—but clarity survives and momentum rarely stalls. No significant loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle interfere with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line by line, the prose is dense yet purposeful; most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing action, deepening character, reinforcing motifs) with minimal redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but pattern-consistent and rarely feels strained; the imagery of ink, math, and mechanical breath builds a coherent texture. The closing sequence—from the alarm chime to the ink pot returning to the cabinet—lands with clarity and rhythm, without clutter or scaffold. I see no significant loops, mixed metaphors, or syntax artifacts that impede momentum or sense.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is remarkably strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) and the metaphors are fresh and internally consistent. The repetition of motifs (hum, light, bonsai, gold edges) reads as pattern rather than loop, and there’s very little scaffolding or redundancy. At times the figurative load is high enough that a few lines verge on saturation, requiring a slower reading, which slightly dents momentum. Nonetheless, the closure image is sharp and undimmed by any figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density, multipurpose sentences, and images that feel fresh yet legible (“silences with fingerprints,” “mourning colors that have faded into commerce”). Figurative language is frequent but patterned and coherent to the character’s world, avoiding mixed or strained metaphors. There is no obvious scaffolding, synonym loops, or template cadence; each line seems to earn its place and propel atmosphere or meaning. The final sentences land cleanly without blur or over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, dense with information, and rarely redundant; figurative language is mostly fresh and internally coherent (“echo nods with a cute cough, then becomes the wind again”). There is heavy metaphorical loading in almost every line, which risks purple density, but the pattern is taught early and controlled enough that momentum largely survives. I see minimal scaffolding or synonym loops, and action sequencing (tuning, bowing, playing, packing up) stays clear amid lyricism. A bit more sparing use of high-concept metaphors in peak beats could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (world, character, theme) without padding, and the rhythm of clauses feels deliberate rather than mechanical. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors stay within a coherent carnival/sea/flow lexicon and don’t muddy meaning. There are no significant loops, scaffolding, or clarity breaks; information always pushes momentum or deepens charge. A few aphoristic lines flirt with over-polish, but they land well enough not to blunt the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-by-line craft is highly controlled: nearly every sentence does double duty advancing atmosphere and character, with no significant loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is abundant but coherent and not piled to the point of obscuring sense; images extend the same conceptual threads (time, light, fossils, breath). Syntax and sentence length vary to create a natural read-aloud rhythm that accelerates with the chemical countdown and breathes in reflection. There are no noticeable grammatical slips or confusing constructions, and the closing lines land with clarity and force.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence does double duty in advancing image and situation, and there is little true redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent with the established metaphorical palette of sound, light, and touch. Syntax and paragraphing create a smooth, propulsive cadence that suits a lyric, accumulative design without bogging down the crisis beats. The density might flirt with overrichness for some editors, but it does not significantly blur cause/effect or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is excellent: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (image, mood, theme, character) with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and mutually reinforcing (“a sound like a door considering whether to close,” “singular convergence was not a thunderclap but a long handshake”). Rhythm varies well, and key beats land cleanly without syntactic muddle. The only brake on an even higher score is that the sustained metaphorical density risks reader fatigue in a few stretches, though it does not obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, metaphors are generally fresh and apt, and nearly every line does double duty for mood and meaning. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and pattern-consistent; images of sound, breath, and balance recur rather than spiraling into mixed metaphors. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, so momentum holds despite the lyricism. A few phrases edge toward ornamental (“tail writing cursive in the dust”), but they don’t materially blur sense or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is consistently strong, dense, and multi-functional: most sentences advance atmosphere, character, and stakes simultaneously, and there are no obvious loops or explanatory scaffolds. Metaphors are generally well-chosen and internally coherent, with musical and liturgical imagery (cathedral, nave, chord, hush) forming a unified field. At moments the figurative density edges toward purple relative to the high-stress situation, which slightly blurs urgency, but not enough to impair causality or the closure image. Syntax and punctuation are clean, varied, and purposeful, maintaining momentum through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, character) and rhythm varies effectively, with many striking yet legible metaphors (“the lighthouse sustains impossibilities the way a jar keeps a firefly”). The prose is dense but mostly avoids redundancy and template cadence, and grammar/usage are clean. There is mild risk of over-saturation—figurative language appears in a high proportion of sentences—which can slightly blur some images and soften the immediacy of the central discovery under the stairs. Nonetheless, momentum holds and the closure image (lattice over drain, beam-like testimony) reads with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is strikingly crafted: sentences frequently do double duty for image and theme, and there is very little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are inventive yet coherent with the established world (grafts as marriages, bead as ferry, veil as letter), and rhythm varies enough to support the accumulating, incantatory feel. The language is undeniably lush, with figurative turns in nearly every line, but it maintains clarity of action and emotional throughline, especially at the closure beat. A stricter culling of one or two slightly over-packed images would reduce the faint risk of purple without sacrificing music.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is lush yet purposeful: most sentences pull double duty, advancing action while layering motif and atmosphere (“The metal sings against hemp, a lullaby of small persistence and shy thunder”). Figurative density is high but coherent, with repeated image families (rope, breath, tides, vows) rather than scattershot metaphor; the language rarely tips into self-indulgence. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic templates dragging momentum, and grammar and sequencing remain clear. The only small limit is that the uniform lyrical intensity offers few sharp textural contrasts, though it doesn’t damage clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is elegant and information-dense, with images that are fresh, coherent, and rarely overstacked; most sentences do at least two jobs (scene, emotion, theme). The rhythm modulates well between long, sinuous lines and shorter, declarative ones at key beats, keeping momentum while honoring the lyric mode. There are no serious loops, mixed metaphors, or register jolts; figurative language saturates the piece but stays legible and purposeful. The only restraint keeping this just shy of the very top is that the density flirts with overload in places, even if it never quite tips into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, information-dense, and sonically controlled; most sentences do at least two jobs (world-building, interiority, and thematic charge) without slack. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and on-theme, with no mixed metaphors or scaffoldy restatements undercutting momentum. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to avoid monotony, and the closing sequence achieves a strong cadence without feeling overwritten. Any risk of purple is mitigated by clarity of action and a consistent conceptual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is densely imagistic yet controlled; most sentences do multiple jobs—advancing action, deepening world, and supporting theme—without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Metaphors are apt and coherent within the story’s logic (rumors as wandering stars, conspiracies as knots to be eased, dust as rehearsal), and there are no mixed or self-contradictory images that muddy closure. Rhythm is varied and well-paced for a lyric piece, allowing breathing room around key turns (the cloth’s throat opening, the whisper hardening into speech, the blame prophecy). The only minor limitation is that the near-constant figurative texture risks slight fatigue, though it never quite tips into opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is densely figurative but remarkably coherent; most metaphors do at least double duty in world-building and emotion, and there’s little to no true scaffolding or synonym-churn. Rhythm varies, sentence openings are diverse, and line-to-line propulsion rarely stalls despite the lyric mode. A few phrases flirt with purple (“fierce tenderness cracking my ribs like kindling trying to become fire”), but they remain legible and in-character rather than overwrought to the point of obscuring action or stakes. Overall, information density and clarity are high enough for immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is excellent: nearly every sentence does double duty (image + emotion or theme), and metaphors are apt and internally consistent (boats, reefs, weather, ink, fog). There is very little scaffolding or repetition; the prose moves forward with clear momentum despite its density. A few lines verge on decorative (“kestrels coil into sleep like commas easing a long sentence”), but they remain legible and on-theme rather than muddying sense. Overall, the piece is lush without tipping into true purple or confusing the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (image, mood, theme) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the read-aloud rhythm is excellent. Figurative language is dense but generally precise and non-contradictory, with very few strained metaphors; repetitions (“because I paint with light”) are pattern-driven rather than accidental. The sheer luxuriance of imagery slightly softens momentum in places, preventing an even higher score but not undermining closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level writing is consistently strong: high information density, varied sentence rhythm, and figurative language that is largely coherent and aligned with the central metaphors of sound, awakening, and mapping. Repetition such as “in the pause between question and reply” functions as an intentional structural refrain rather than a loop artifact, and there is little to no scaffolding or synonym churn. Despite the heavy metaphor load, images rarely feel mixed or overextended; most do at least two jobs (world-building and theme, or character and atmosphere). A few metaphors are lush enough that a ruthless editor might trim for breath, but they do not obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is tight and musical: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, theme) with high information density, and metaphors are generally precise and non-redundant. Lyricism is sustained without devolving into purple prose; images feel curated rather than piled on. There are virtually no scaffolding lines or paraphrase loops, and the final movement (“a message should be heavier than a lie,” the bean “ENTER”) lands with clear, potent rhythm. At moments the density of figurative language verges on saturation, which may slightly slow momentum for some readers, but not enough to blur clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is lush but largely controlled: most sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, theme) without collapsing into mush, and rhythm varies well. Repeated phrases act as incantatory structure more than paraphrase loops, and there is little scaffolding or filler. A few metaphors verge on saturation, but they retain internal logic and do not obscure the closure image of the shell-as-gardened-climate. Clarity of sequence and transformation remains intact despite the density, which is rare at this register.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is very strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and sentences that usually do more than one job. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and pattern-taught from the opening, and it doesn’t materially obscure causality or closure. A few images verge on saturation (“foxglove regret,” “mothwing of cooled thunder,” “coins of light”), creating occasional near-purple richness, which slightly reduces clarity in places. Nonetheless, momentum holds and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush yet mostly precise, with high information density—lines routinely carry setting, character, and theme at once (e.g., “Dust motes hung like annotations, each particle a footnote to vanished grammars and failed vows”). Rhythm varies well between long lyric sentences and shorter, grounding beats, so momentum rarely stalls. Metaphorical saturation is high but coherent within the musical/linguistic frame; it does not devolve into mixed metaphors or obscured causality. A handful of lines tilt toward abstraction or slogan (“truth harms…bruises without accompaniment”) which slightly undercut the otherwise exemplary line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: almost every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with clean syntax and vivid but legible metaphor. Recurring images (breath, dust, chain, residue, hum) are patterned rather than repetitive, and there are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or template cadences. Despite high figurative density, the prose rarely slips into muddle or self-contradiction, and the closure image is sharp and earned. If anything, some editors might prefer a bit more sparseness in high-pressure beats, but momentum is maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is rich and efficient: most sentences do double or triple duty in setting, emotion, and theme, with strong rhythmic variation (“soft as flour, strong as rope”). Figurative language is dense but rarely feels purple or muddled; images usually cohere logically and tonally with the established world. Minor issues include slight self-repetition and a couple of metaphors that edge toward over-insistence (“trust returns across learning to trust again,” “blooming withering” echoed closely), but they do not meaningfully obscure momentum or closure. Overall, the prose is publish-grade and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, setting, theme) with minimal redundancy. The figurative density is high but internally coherent, with motifs echoing rather than clashing (doors, seams, rows, codes, wind). Rhythm varies smoothly, and the final lines land with clarity rather than purple haze. A few metaphors tread close to abstraction, but they do not obscure causality or dilute the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is lush but remarkably disciplined: metaphors stay coherent to water, light, breath, and mapping; there are no major mixed images or rhythm-deadening loops. Sentences tend to multi-task—building world, mood, and character at once—without visible scaffolding or redundancy. Momentum is preserved despite lyric density; each line adds a new facet rather than paraphrasing the last. The prose does flirt with purple in a few places, but never enough to blur meaning or undermine the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world, mood, theme) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the read-aloud rhythm is carefully varied. Figurative language is dense but largely precise, with images (paths as sentences, seeds as commas) reinforcing one another rather than clashing. There is some risk of saturation—nearly every line carries a metaphor—which slightly flattens contrast and could fatigue a demanding editor. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is densely imagistic yet precise; most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously) without felt redundancy. Metaphor chains remain internally consistent (chess, tides, stars, coins) and avoid muddling sense even under heightened lyricism. Momentum never drags; line-level choices keep the scene advancing even in reflective moments. There is minimal scaffolding or looped phrasing, and the closure image is clear and potent rather than obscured by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are precise, varied in structure, and typically do multiple jobs (world, emotion, theme) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is inventive and rarely muddled, and key motifs (gaps, harbor, moonstone, obsidian grace) are handled with control rather than churn. The prose occasionally borders on uniform lushness—nearly every sentence strives for image, with few plain beats for contrast—but clarity and momentum remain intact. There are no glaring loops, scaffolds, or copy-level errors dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a rich but controlled figurative palette—images like “a chamber of angles and breath to bend fog into colors” both advance concept and tone. Most lines do double or triple duty (character, setting, and theme at once), with minimal scaffolding or repetition. The density of metaphor is high, yet internal logic holds; there are no real mixed metaphors or syntactic stumbles. A very slight trimming of conceptual phrases (e.g., “delicate arithmetic of light”) could increase propulsion without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is highly controlled: sentences vary in length and rhythm, imagery is fresh and coherent (“face stiff as wet leather,” “town’s dark” with houses as unopenable eyes), and almost every line does double duty (scene + theme, or character + world). There’s dense figurative language, but it rarely tips into purple or redundancy, and patterns (fire, paper, breath, translation) are consistent rather than scattered. No significant scaffolding or paraphrase loops blunt momentum, and the closure image is clear and resonant. Any slight lushness feels intentional and in service to mood.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and information-dense; most sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and conceptual work). Metaphor use is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned (balloons, tides, eddies), with no significant mixed images or scaffolding loops. Rhythm varies well, and the final line neatly recharges earlier motifs (gauge, serene upheaval) without overexplaining. A very slight tendency toward saturation in figurative language might benefit from one or two trims, but it does not obscure clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: high information density, varied syntax, and almost every sentence doing double duty (world + emotion, image + theme). Figurative language is frequent but not muddled; the metaphors are coherent, context-appropriate, and rarely feel decorative. There are no noticeable paraphrase loops or template cadences, and rhythm supports the accumulative, listening-driven mode. Any hint of “purple” is countered by clarity of action and image, especially around the negative, hopscotch, and letter beats.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush but largely disciplined; nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (image, emotion, world logic) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Metaphors are original and internally coherent—“each droplet a small lantern of refracted guidance,” “hands I had yet to hold”—with no major mixed or strained vehicles. There is a lot of figurative language in succession, which edges toward excess but doesn’t significantly blur sense or momentum, especially since the piece is designed as lyric. A hair more variation with one or two plainer sentences at peak might sharpen contrast, but line-level craft is strong enough for immediate publication.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, metaphors are fresh (“lanterns shook like small moons,” “night advanced like a reader”), and most lines multitask for setting, character, and theme. Repetition of certain structures (“Through ritual significance…”) feels intentional as motif rather than scaffold, and there are no real loops or clotted figurative strings that blur sense. Information density is high without sacrificing clarity, and transitions between images remain legible. A few sentences verge on slogan-like (“Use was the word that saved us”), which slightly flattens texture in spots but doesn’t compromise momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences are varied in rhythm, densely informative, and typically do more than one job (world-building, character, and theme interlaced). Extended metaphors are consistent and rarely feel strained, and there is minimal scaffolding or repetition. The prose flirts with density—image upon image—but clarity and momentum remain intact through the climax and final image. A touch of metaphor stacking in a few lines keeps it just shy of absolute top-tier minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: dense yet largely efficient metaphor, high information-per-sentence, and minimal redundancy; images such as “faces opened like a lantern” and “a bell made of dew” are striking and coherent. Repetition of key phrases works as structural echo rather than looped padding, and there are no clarity-breaking mixed metaphors. The only real drag is occasional over-saturation—nearly every sentence is figurative—which can blur edges of key beats like the guards’ approach. Even so, causality and closure remain clear, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong, with most sentences doing dual work—advancing ethical stakes while enriching atmosphere (“half-lit epiphanies rose like smoke that forgot its fire”). Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled; images extend each other (strings, ribs, constellations, current) instead of clashing. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding, and syntax has healthy variety. A few metaphors verge on density that could risk reader fatigue, but they don’t materially obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is dense, musical, and remarkably controlled: metaphors are fresh and coherent (“burned syllable of orange,” “names composting under municipal forgetfulness”) and most sentences do at least two jobs. Rhythm varies well, and there are no serious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic glitches; information advances consistently. The main restraint is that figurative language is nearly constant, which, while suitable for lyric mode, occasionally risks saturation where a plain line might punch harder. Even so, clarity is rarely compromised, and the closure image arrives clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are information-dense and multitask, advancing ritual, setting, and emotion at once. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, with few if any mixed metaphors or redundant scaffolding lines. Rhythm varies between longer, winding sentences and tighter ones to good effect, and there are no significant clarity lapses despite the lushness. The density of imagery comes close to oversaturation in places, but not enough to dull the closure image or obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding, and most metaphors are coherent and mutually reinforcing. Figurative language appears in nearly every line but forms a consistent pattern rather than a muddle, and images typically do more than one job (worldbuilding, theme, and emotion together). A few spots come close to overload (“map that writhes like a nest of eels, a qualm of roads”) and could gain power from selective sparseness, but clarity and momentum are preserved through the end. Grammar, pacing, and closure image (“my name stops being a maze and becomes a direction”) are clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is very strong: high information density, varied syntax, and metaphors that are both vivid and coherent with the world (“plaster fell in gray feathers,” “the wall unscrolled a map of winds”). Figurative language is frequent but disciplined, usually doing double duty for setting, mood, and theme without collapsing into purple. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding sentences, or mechanical cadences; rhythm adjusts to contemplative and charged beats smoothly. A few sentences verge on aphorism, but they still advance character and theme rather than stalling the read.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: minimal redundancy, high information density, and metaphors that mostly cohere and deepen rather than blur meaning (“He smiles like a door learning it was always a window” is memorable and apt). Syntax and paragraphing create a smooth reading experience with clear sequential logic despite the surreal setting. There is some risk of figurative saturation—nearly every sentence carries an image—which may slightly dull impact over time but does not harm clarity or closure. Overall, it’s polished, publishable prose with only a trace of purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is tight and musical, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (advancing action, deepening image, reinforcing theme). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and non-redundant; images like “stars flickered in its ribs like trapped bees” and “mirrors sang like knives” sharpen rather than blur clarity. There are no obvious scaffold lines, synonym loops, or mixed metaphors that undercut the closure image. A slight saturation of imagery in places keeps it just shy of absolute top-tier restraint, but it remains controlled and readable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, emotion, theme) with minimal padding, and the rhythm varies effectively. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled; the metaphors tend to align around craft, decay, and breath, which keeps them cohesive. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and clarity of action and emotional state is never in doubt. The only arguable weakness is a slight uniformity of lushness—no deliberately “plain” counter-texture—which may feel a touch rich for some markets but doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and often do double or triple duty in image, worldbuilding, and theme. Figurative language is original and mostly coherent, with recurring motifs (pages, fruit, tide, bathrooms, rainwater) reused purposefully rather than as churn. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the final paragraph lands on a clean, charged image. The metaphor density is high enough that a few images (“book written by weather,” “ledger,” “pages that keep writing us”) jostle slightly, but they don’t seriously blur sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is precise, musical, and information-dense; many lines do double duty for atmosphere and theme (“silence remembers what it forgot,” “a life lodged like a bookmark”). Imagery is consistently fresh and coherent with the world’s logic, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The risk is mild over-saturation: metaphor is present in nearly every sentence, which can slightly blur dynamic contrast and momentum, though clarity of action and causality remains intact. With a touch more variation in texture—allowing a few plainer, cutting lines around key turns—this would be at a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, varied syntax, and figurative language that usually does more than one job (e.g., “bay opened into a bruise-colored circle of hush” marries setting, mood, and harm). Repetition of key images functions structurally rather than as padding, and nearly every sentence advances either atmosphere or the central conflict. However, imagery is stacked in most sentences, flirting with purple; a ruthless editor might trim one or two metaphors per paragraph for maximum impact. Clarity at closure is preserved, so this density is a minor, not structural, concern.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and musical, with high information density and minimal scaffold or repetition. Figurative language tends to be coherent and thematically linked (knots as grammar, doors as refusals, archives as braids), and rarely lapses into mixed metaphor. The prose occasionally edges toward abstraction in its discussions of absence but stays anchored enough in objects and actions that momentum isn’t lost. There are no noticeable grammatical slips or structural artifacts, and the final lines neatly echo and tighten earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is remarkably strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, theme) with little redundancy, and the rhythm of clauses mirrors shifts in pressure. Figurative language is dense but mostly precise and non-contradictory—“blue to the tongue, clear to the bones” is both strange and legible. There is minimal scaffolding or synonym churn; nearly every line advances image or concept. The occasional sense of near-uniform lyric intensity, without sharper textural contrast in the highest-pressure beats, is the only reason this doesn’t reach the absolute top.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and often do double duty for setting, character, and theme; there are few if any true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and sensical (“wind threaded its ribs,” “dew suspended on spider silk”), supporting a cohesive aesthetic. Momentum holds despite lyricism, with procedural sequences (trimming the shard, aligning mirrors) giving the prose a backbone. I’m not higher mainly because the saturation of metaphor flirts with over-richness at times, risking blur between images rather than always sharpening specific beats.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is excellent: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, characterization, and thematic shading) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are inventive yet coherent, and the prose’s musicality supports, rather than obscures, meaning; key beats (“a feather that remembered summers,” the plum memory, the seam of lightning) are crystal-clear. The density of figurative language is high but rarely purple, and momentum is preserved despite the lyric mode. A few lines verge on decorative flourish rather than pressure-bearing, which prevents this from reaching the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is lush, original, and highly controlled; many sentences do double duty for image and concept (“flame walked the cord, polite as a messenger with wild news”). Rhythm varies well, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. However, figurative density is very high almost everywhere, and in a few spots it risks veering toward purple or self-conscious (“the quiet of a hiding drum,” “keys were petals strung on a ring of rust”), slightly blurring sharpness. Trimming one or two metaphors and letting a few plain lines breathe would increase impact.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level work is exceptionally strong: dense figurative language stays coherent and non-redundant, and nearly every sentence does multiple jobs (setting, psychology, theme) without padding. Rhythm varies gracefully, with longer lyric stretches punctuated by crisp declaratives (“Tonight, our pause had discovered its hinge, and we both dared to press”). There are no noticeable metaphor clashes, scaffold sentences, or synonym loops; the imagery remains tethered to the established sea/tide/cicada palette. Despite the high lyric density, clarity of action and stakes never blurs, which is unusual at this register.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is dense and inventive, with most sentences doing double duty for image and theme, and rhythm that breathes appropriately at turns (e.g., the landing widening, the final collaborative drafting). Metaphor is rich but mostly controlled; a few lines come close to saturation (“stretching contracted like a lung exercising itself” adjacent to other figurative beats) yet do not materially obscure sense or closure. There’s virtually no scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic monotony, and the final images read cleanly. The only restraint on a higher score is that the unrelieved high-lyric register might feel fractionally ornate for the most exacting venues.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: the prose is dense with image yet rarely redundant, and most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character insight at once). Figurative language is frequent but internally consistent—trains, cables, terraces, and prisms recur in ways that reinforce rather than muddle the imagery. There are no notable loops or scaffolding sentences; recurring phrases (especially the train-whistle hush) are clearly patterned rather than accidental. A few lines verge on aphorism, but they remain anchored enough in concrete scene that momentum and clarity are not compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: high information density, vivid figurative language, and almost no redundancy or scaffold. Metaphors are fresh and largely coherent (“a throne of wires and wood facing an empty wall that bore only the faint burns of former decisions”) and the prose balances lyricism with clarity. Sentence variety and paragraphing maintain momentum despite the contemplative mode. There is mild risk of over-saturation in imagery, but it never quite tips into muddle or slows comprehension at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with few redundancies, and the cadence is varied and musical. Figurative density is high, but metaphors are largely coherent and mutually reinforcing (breath/ash/bridges/thresholds/scars) rather than mixed. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line feels necessary to the accumulated pressure. The slight risk is occasional saturation—moments where an extra beat of plainness might give the imagery more room—but it doesn’t significantly blunt clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is lush and inventive with very high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. The metaphoric fabric is remarkably consistent (pressure, oceans, vows, light), with minimal muddle or contradiction despite its density. There is some risk of overload; nearly every line is figurative, which could be fractionally trimmed for breath without losing power. Nonetheless, clarity of action and emotional throughline remain intact, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is highly polished: sentences are rhythmic, varied in length, and dense with layered meaning (“a tone like breathing brass,” “questions wearing boots of grief”). Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; metaphors extend and echo rather than clash, and most lines do more than one job (image, mood, and theme in concert). There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and transitions between images remain lucid despite the lyric intensity. The only constraint on a still-higher score is that the sheer density of ornament occasionally nudges toward excess, risking reader fatigue at elite-editor standards.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is highly crafted, with strong verb choices, layered images, and an absence of obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops; nearly every sentence does double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is rich yet generally coherent—constellations that root, equations in bark, mornings projected on glass—without mixing vehicles to the point of confusion. Rhythm varies nicely and the final line lands cleanly without clutter. The density is near the upper bound for this length and might flirt with overload for some readers, but it rarely obscures causality or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (character, atmosphere, and thematic charge) without bloat. Figurative language is dense but controlled and coherent; metaphors of dust, maps, and corridors interlock rather than compete, and there are no obvious mixed or strained images. Syntax and paragraphing vary to maintain momentum, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase-loop redundancy. The final third remains clear despite high lyrical intensity, with the closure image crisp rather than obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and nearly every image does double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors like “tiny hearts restarting after winter” or “the city spoke softly, and she listened” clarify rather than blur. There is little to no redundance or scaffolding—events advance steadily with no obvious filler. The only minor brake on a higher score is that the sheer density of imagery occasionally flirts with over-richness, risking reader saturation in a few spots.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences pull triple duty (world-building, mood, and pressure) and the rhythm varies without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but remarkably coherent—metaphors cluster around condensation, sound, negative space, and clothing the hush, avoiding muddle. There is a mild risk of saturation in places (nearly every sentence bearing a metaphor), which slightly blurs impact but does not obscure sense or closure. The final beats, especially the “ring where the sentence nearly closed,” land cleanly and without ornament that would dull them.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences vary in rhythm and length, carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, theme) at once, and avoid scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but mostly precise and coherent (“ash sifts like sugar through the raftered branches” is a good example), and the prose moves forward rather than circling. Grammar and sequencing are clean, with no genuine opacity around cause/effect. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the relentless lyricism approaches purple in a few spots, which might benefit from one or two plainer counterpoints for emphasis.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that often do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Phrases like “a heartbeat divining a vein” or “watching everything, and learned the value of traveling without certainty” are striking and clear. The prose occasionally flirts with over-saturation of metaphor and abstraction, especially in thematic statements, which risks slowing momentum. Still, clarity remains intact and there are no significant loops or artifacts dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush but generally controlled: most metaphors are coherent, multipurpose, and deepen both world and emotion (“tunnel collapsed like a closing fist,” “stone’s black lungs”). Nearly every sentence advances character, world, or theme; there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few lines edge toward conceptual stacking (several abstract nouns in sequence), but they don’t obscure sense or dull the closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm and syntactic variety are strong, keeping momentum through a non-action-driven piece.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images generally pull double duty (evoking both atmosphere and theme), and there’s very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is dense but mostly disciplined, with memorable, coherent metaphors (“the light wearing her name until it could let her go”) that don’t undercut clarity. The prose moves forward without loops; each paragraph adds a distinct turn or texture. The only ceiling is that figurative saturation flirts with overrichness in places, which might risk reader fatigue in a longer piece but remains under control here.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: high information density, multi-purpose sentences, and metaphors that are fresh and coherent with the established logic (“applause shared by beings who photosynthesize regret”). The prose is consistently lyric, yet avoids major muddle; each image pushes character, setting, or theme forward. There is some risk of saturation—nearly every line is figurative—which may pare back accessibility for certain venues, but the pattern is taught early and stays controlled. No meaningful loops, scaffolding, or rhythm artifacts blunt the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“zeroed maps,” “ferments of moonlight”). There’s little scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every line either advances the ritual or deepens the world, and the final paragraphs land with clarity and resonance. However, figurative language is nearly continuous—metaphor stacked on metaphor—which, while often beautiful, risks a touch of saturation and could benefit from an occasional plainer sentence to sharpen contrast and keep every image fully legible. None of this seriously harms closure, but it does keep the prose just shy of the absolute top band for economy.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (image, character, theme) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but precise and internally coherent (e.g., the ledger “like a moth,” ghosts “pooling like breath in winter”), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. Rhythm varies and propels the accumulative pressure, and there are no noticeable scaffold loops or clarity errors. The closure image is crisp and unsmudged by overwriting, allowing the accumulated motifs to resonate cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (world-building, mood, and stakes) without redundancy. Figurative language is dense but controlled; images (frost as script, cloud sea as teeth, whispers as mist) cohere into a single imaginative system rather than competing. There are no obvious scaffold phrases, loops, or metaphor tangles that blur causality, and syntax varies to maintain momentum. The climax and closing images are particularly clean and sharp, with no purple drag on the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is densely imagistic yet remarkably precise; phrases such as “the covered mirrors sighed like sleeping swans” or “planets ticking like clockwork grapes” do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme) without redundancy. Sentence rhythm varies well across the piece, sustaining momentum in a largely reflective, lyric narrative. Figurative language is frequent but patterned and coherent, avoiding metaphor muddle or synonym churn. A few lines verge on conceptual abstraction, but they remain anchored enough in objects and action that clarity and closure never suffer.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush but purposeful; most metaphors do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“melodies that bruise like fruit,” “a wooden lung whose bellows remembered every lullaby that ever forgave a child”). Sentence rhythm varies well between incantatory long lines and shorter, decisive beats as the bargain crystallizes, sustaining momentum despite lyric density. There are no real loops or muddled images, and the closure paragraph is clear, concrete, and thematically charged. Only the near-constant figurative register keeps this just below absolute top-tier minimalism, but it never tips into confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is dense and musical, with strong verbs and concrete nouns doing layered work; there is little true scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are mostly coherent and fresh, and the rhythm varies enough to keep momentum through a contemplative piece. There is a mild tendency toward continuous figurative flourish (“water…black with inquiry,” “dark currency,” “pages turning in a salt library”) that approaches purple but doesn’t quite collapse sense or clarity. Trimming one or two metaphor stacks in the middle and late sections would sharpen impact to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied in length, and usually multitask (advancing image, theme, and character simultaneously). Metaphors are mostly precise and grounded in the story’s material vocabulary (woodworking, tides, stitching), giving the prose a unified texture. However, the figurative density is very high—nearly every sentence carries an image—which occasionally edges toward overload and risks numbing impact rather than sharpening it. There are no significant loops or scaffolding artifacts, but a touch more austerity in key beats would elevate this to elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, carry multiple functions (image, emotion, and world-building at once), and maintain momentum despite the reflective mode. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with coherent metaphor families (flowers, glass, light, breath) rather than mixed or clashing images. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase; nearly every line adds a new facet of atmosphere or understanding. The density is high, yet closure remains crisp and unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush, information-dense, and rhythmically varied, with many lines doing double duty for image, theme, and plot (“Their pens hover like gulls starving over a clean beach, then dive and tear the future into sanctioned pieces”). Figurative language is sustained but mostly coherent, and there’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony. A few metaphors skate close to excess or could be seen as competing rather than sharpening focus, especially in the middle beats, which slightly dulls edge clarity. At a prestige venue, an editor might trim 5–10% for austerity, but the line craft is otherwise very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty, advancing world, character, and theme with minimal scaffolding, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent (lanterns as faded thoughts, prices as prerequisites for children arguing); it supports rather than obscures meaning. A few lines verge on aphorism, and density is high throughout, which risks mild overload but doesn’t significantly blunt the closure image. There are no evident loops, mixed metaphors, or clarity issues around the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences carry multiple layers (world, mood, interiority) with little waste, and rhythm varies to support pressure. Figurative language is dense but mostly precise and coherent, rarely feeling like ornament for its own sake. The closing paragraphs in particular are clean, with clear action and image anchoring the abstractions. A few metaphors (“grammar cried for land,” “verbs that rustle like moths”) flirt with opacity, but do not significantly impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is superb: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) with very little redundancy. Figurative language is dense but controlled; metaphors extend the core motifs (seeds, frost, gears, libraries) rather than scattering into noise. I see no significant loops or scaffolding phrases, and the closure beats are clean, sharp, and memorable. The only arguable weakness is that the sustained lushness may slightly blur urgency, but it doesn’t harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush but largely disciplined: metaphors are inventive yet coherent (“empty lung,” “rope’s frayed heart,” “snow with discipline of scouts”), and most sentences carry multiple jobs—world, character, and theme at once. There is some density of figurative language, but patterns are taught early and remain legible; momentum keeps moving toward zero hour without obvious paraphrase loops. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough for a good read-aloud rhythm, with the final lines landing cleanly. A small fraction of images (“microclimate variations rethreading themselves under attentive observation”) flirt with vagueness but do not materially obscure cause or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, and theme), rhythm varies, and metaphors are mostly fresh and coherent (“fossil pollen,” “a coil would shiver like a throat”). The density of figurative language is high but patterned and purposeful, fitting the lyric mode rather than reading as purple for its own sake. There are no obvious paraphrase loops or structural artifacts, and the closure image is clear and cleanly rendered. A slight risk is that nearly every line is metaphorical, which might exhaust some readers, but it doesn’t materially blur causality or momentum here.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but controlled: most sentences do double or triple duty in setting, theme, and character without slipping into muddled metaphor. Repetition patterns (“mute eloquence,” “contextual clues,” daily ritual with the box) feel intentional rather than looped scaffold, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent, with recurring semantic fields (bees, glass, ash, light) rather than random flourish. The lushness may be marginally more uniform than ideal for peak-pressure beats, but clarity and closure remain fully intact.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is lush yet purposeful; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action), as in “receipts that tasted like rainstorms” or “a pocketknife that cut dust.” Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent (time, weather, agriculture, synesthesia), avoiding mixed metaphors or logical violations. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the narrative moves forward steadily despite its lyricism. A few descriptions approach purple, but they do not obscure causality or blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-by-line craft is highly controlled: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, emotion) with little scaffolding, and there are no real loops or redundancies. Figurative density is high but remarkably coherent—images of weaving, thread, song, and water interlock rather than clash, and physical logic holds. A few phrases (“kites like lacquered leaves,” “tide math”) flirt with decorative flourish but don’t obstruct clarity or momentum. Rhythm varies enough to keep the piece moving, though the uniformly lush texture leaves minimal negative space for contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is abundant but controlled, with metaphors and personifications (pillars’ appetite, fungus alphabet, kelp as punctuation) coherent and sensorial rather than showy. Rhythm varies, and the prose reads cleanly aloud without loops or template cadences. It stops just shy of perfection because the density of imagery is almost unrelenting, and a hair more spareness around key turns might have sharpened impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and metaphors that are both fresh and coherent (“a window that mapped our various origins,” “a fossil alphabet spelling yes”). Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and pattern-consistent with the narrator’s mind; it rarely feels purple or redundant. There are no noticeable loops, syntactic templates, or clarity breaks, including at closure. The sheer density of imagery flirts with overload in places, but it doesn’t materially drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is remarkably strong: nearly every sentence does double duty in image and idea, with metaphors that are coherent within a tight field of motifs (salt, language, bone, treaty). There is minimal redundancy; phrases like “salting the wounds of earth with sweetness” or “the first bats delete gnats” advance both scene and theme. The density of figurative language is high, but here it reads as intentional lyric concentration rather than purple drift, and clarity is never lost. A very minor critique is that the uniform richness can slightly flatten momentum, as there are few deliberately “thin” lines to make the peaks stand out.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and image) without feeling padded, and figurative language is fresh yet legible (“every gust sounded like a door learning to breathe”). Metaphor density is high but well-controlled; images extend a coherent scrap/organism motif rather than clashing. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or syntactic templates, and the closing lines land cleanly without purple blur. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum from reflective beginning to relay scene to soft denouement.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished, with strong rhythms, varied syntax, and dense lines that usually carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically aligned with time, navigation, and silence; it reads as a deliberate lyric mode rather than uncontrolled purple. There are few to no paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences, and the final lines land with clarity. A slight tendency toward constant metaphor keeps it just shy of the very top band but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is very strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, and most images pull double duty for worldbuilding and theme (e.g., “cold that forgot how to bite,” “ships sailed the stratosphere like patient sharks”). Figurative density is high but generally coherent and pattern-consistent, avoiding mixed metaphors or redundancy. There are no visible scaffold loops or cadence templates that drag momentum. A few formulations edge toward ornament (“monks teaching sparrows to bow then letting them steal incense”), but they still earn their keep rather than obscuring action.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly crafted, with most sentences doing double duty (advancing image and theme) and very little scaffolding or redundancy; metaphors are extended and coherent rather than piled incoherently. Information density is high but legible; the ritual of spelling words remains clear despite the lyricism. There are no noticeable loops or template cadences, and the final paragraphs land with precise, fresh phrasing (“They will think I vanished; I will travel with the nomadic penumbra…”). The only soft constraint on an even higher score is that figurative language saturates nearly every line, which slightly risks monotony under a stricter minimalist standard, though it doesn’t harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong: most sentences do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffold or repetition. The density of figurative language is high, yet metaphors generally cohere and stay internally logical; there are few, if any, mixed or confusing images. A demanding line edit might prune a handful of lush phrases that don’t add incremental pressure, but they do not significantly obscure cause and effect or the closure image. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final paragraphs in particular land with clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing double duty for image and meaning without paraphrase loops or muddled metaphors. Repetitions (“woven hush,” “labyrinth,” thunder) are pattern-taught motifs rather than scaffolding. Syntax varies and tracks emotional tempo, and despite the lyrical register, clarity of action and causality remains strong. There is no significant overwriting that obscures the closure image or dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion, or image plus theme), and the rhythm varies enough to avoid singsong despite consistently figurative language. The metaphors are generally coherent and aligned with the world’s logic, and the density of imagery feels like a deliberate, pattern-taught lyric mode rather than purple drift. There is minimal redundancy or scaffold; the narrative advances with each line and remains clear through the climactic negotiation. A few images verge on saturation, but they do not blur causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and metaphor-heavy but largely avoids redundancy and mixed images; most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and action). Rhythm is varied, with a strong read-aloud cadence and no obvious template stems or synonym loops. A few lines flirt with over-saturation, yet they never obscure basic causality or dull the closure image of golden seams and rising pontoons. Overall, information density and line-level control are high, with only minor risk of purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is very strong: sentences are dense with information and often do double duty for setting, emotion, and theme without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is abundant but thematically unified around sea, light, breath, and reflection, avoiding mixed or incoherent metaphors. Momentum is maintained despite the lyric density; there are no obvious paraphrase loops or padded explanations, and grammar/punctuation are clean. A few lines lean into abstraction, but they remain anchored enough in image not to blur closure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: nearly every sentence does double duty for image and theme, and the read-aloud rhythm is carefully managed. Figurative density is extreme but controlled; metaphors (“freighter sleeps…like a dull knife,” “each drop is a small ear”) are fresh and rarely stray into muddle. There is little scaffolding or repetition, and momentum is preserved despite the lyric mode. A slight sense of saturation—so few plain, grounding lines—keeps it just shy of the very top tier for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and rarely redundant; images are largely fresh and coherent (“a wounded animal learning to breathe,” “salt pans that mirror every star that forgot to burn out”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, establishing a clear pattern early so it doesn’t read as purple or gratuitous. I see no significant scaffold sentences or paraphrase loops; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. A few abstractions in the final paragraphs flirt with overtness, but they don’t blur clarity or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and characterization—without redundancy. Figurative language is abundant but tightly chosen; images extend rather than clash, and no mixed or incoherent metaphors undercut clarity. There is no visible scaffolding, synonym churn, or template cadence; rhythm varies smoothly with scene needs. The final paragraphs deliver both narrative and emotional payoff without resorting to exposition or summary.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries more than one function (image, characterization, or thematic charge), and the metaphoric texture—stones, opal, ledgers, gaps—feels cohesive rather than overgrown. There are no significant redundancy loops or scaffolding sentences; the reflection about the girl and the dock’s stored pain advances both plot and theme. The prose approaches the edge of purple in places, but rhythm and clarity are preserved, and figurative language stays legible and grounded in the established world logic. The final paragraphs, in particular, balance abstraction with concrete action (writing the name, folding the page, sweeping the dock) in a way that keeps momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level work is exceptionally strong: dense but controlled imagery, high information-per-sentence, and no visible scaffold, loops, or synonym churn. Metaphors are fresh and internally coherent (“pages turning under slow water,” “a skiff of light riding mineral thresholds”) and they advance character and theme rather than merely decorating. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with shorter, sharper lines around decisions and longer, braided ones in contemplative or descriptive passages. The prose sustains its ambition without sliding into purple or obscuring causality, including in the closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, most images do double duty for atmosphere and theme, and there is minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and fresh (“voice of a wet veil whisked across tile,” “ring that remembered every finger it had ever circled”). The prose pushes up against purple without tipping over; nearly every sentence earns its place by adding pressure, image, or insight. A slight easing of metaphor density in one or two mid-climb lines could sharpen impact, but momentum and clarity remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense, imaginative, and generally precise, with many lines doing multiple jobs of worldbuilding, emotion, and theme simultaneously. Occasional metaphoric stacking (“ash-petaled, casting quiet crownlets…like moths that have learned metallurgy”) veers toward ornamental and risks slight blur, triggering a modest purple-prose deduction per the rubric. There are no obvious loops, scaffolds, or syntax artifacts; information flow remains clear and momentum forward. The closure image is cleanly rendered and not obscured by figurative muddle, preserving impact.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is densely figurative but generally precise, with many sentences doing double duty for image and psychology (“stones stacked like unsent letters,” “coffee and leave slips to map sleeping weather”). There’s little scaffolding or repetition; momentum is maintained even in reflective stretches. At times the metaphor-per-sentence density risks slight overload, but clarity and closure remain intact. Syntax and punctuation are clean, and the final lines land crisply without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line by line, the prose is dense yet efficient: most sentences do double duty in image and emotional shading, with very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but coheres around a few motifs (water, fog, breath, language) rather than scattering into mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies enough to prevent singsong while maintaining a recognizable cadence. Nothing at the end is obscured by ornament; the final “recording of water and laughter” lands with clarity and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is high, with dense yet generally precise imagery (“panic a bell,” “surface tightens like a held eyelid,” “a small spine teaching itself to stand”) and little to no redundancy. The prose sustains a musical rhythm without obvious template cadences, and each sentence tends to carry multiple jobs (world, emotion, theme). There is a risk of saturation—nearly every line is figurative—but the metaphors remain coherent with the established storm/tea/rune lexicon, so clarity survives. A touch more sparseness around the peak could heighten impact, but as-is it’s strong enough for competitive consideration.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is strong: images are often surprising yet legible (“dust sang under my shoes as if the floor were a throat cleared for confession”; “letters looked like footprints smudged by tide”). Sentences vary rhythmically, and most do multiple jobs (advancing plot, character, and atmosphere at once) with minimal scaffolding. There is a high density of figurative language, which occasionally flirts with excess, but the pattern is taught early and sustains a coherent texture rather than becoming muddled. I see no significant loops or syntactic artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and concept, and the rhythm of clauses and paragraphing reads deliberate and musical. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled, and key metaphors (spiral as arbitration, rain deferred until the valley learns “listen”) stay coherent. There is some density that edges toward saturation, with many abstract nouns in close succession, which slightly blunts momentum and could be trimmed without loss. Still, clarity at the closure beat is intact, and there are no obvious loops, scaffolds, or syntactic artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is very strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, character, and theme), and imagery is fresh and coherent (“echoes stitched themselves thin as frost along the railings”). There is a sustained metaphorical density, but it feels patterned and disciplined rather than purple, and causality/moment-to-moment clarity remains intact. I see almost no scaffold, synonym churn, or paraphrase loops; progression feels lean despite the lyricism. The only constraint on a higher score is that some lines edge toward overt thematic restatement, marginally softening the punch of the final images in an elite-market context.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is highly controlled: each sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, interiority, theme) without obvious redundancy, and metaphors are coherent and rooted in the story’s motifs (music, breath, lattices, water). There’s strong rhythm and variation at paragraph and sentence scales, and no discernible scaffold, synonym churn, or figurative muddle; the “quiet wildfire” image at the end is clear and earned. A few lines verge on quotable aphorism, which slightly risks over-statement relative to the otherwise embodied texture. Overall, the prose is publication-ready at a demanding venue.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, dense with meaning, and usually do double duty for image and theme (“the storm had gentled, and clover along the curb steamed in a way that made grief smell green”). Figurative language is frequent but pattern-consistent and purposeful, building a coherent texture instead of devolving into purple mush. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each line tends to move something. A few metaphors flirt with over-richness, but they don’t obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line by line, the prose is dense yet controlled; nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (world-building, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned with sound, light, and machinery, and the rhythm modulates well between calm accumulation and the sharpened emergency beat. There are no confusing metaphors or loops that blunt the closure image, and the final paragraphs land with clean, charged economy.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is lush yet mostly disciplined; nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs—image, theme, and emotional shading—without major redundancy or confusion. The figurative density is very high, but metaphors stay coherent and motif-tied (ink, tide, steeping, ledgers), and action remains legible despite the lyricism. One could argue for a touch of overrichness that slightly blurs urgency, but it does not materially obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is highly polished: dense, multi-tasking sentences that carry image, mood, and information with minimal redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and grounded, and there are no noticeable scaffold loops or template cadences dulling momentum. Rhythm varies well across the piece, and the final paragraphs land cleanly without figurative muddle. At times the metaphor load edges toward saturation, which slightly blurs a few beats, but it does not materially harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush but largely disciplined: most sentences pull double duty, advancing atmosphere and character while maintaining clarity. Metaphors are coherent and thematically linked to mapping, sound, and astronomy; there’s little genuine purple despite the density. Rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and the closure image is sharp, not muddied. The only restraint on a higher score is that figurative intensity is near-constant, leaving few moments of plainer texture that might better contrast and thus sharpen key peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but controlled—most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, characterization, theme) without redundancy or sludge. Figurative language is fresh and coherent; images like “a blanket that remembers several winters and waits” expand meaning rather than blur it. Rhythm varies effectively, with longer, sinuous lines giving way to short, declarative pivots at key moments, and there is no noticeable scaffolding or synonym-looping. The closure image and phrasing are clear and resonant, not overworked, despite the conceptual ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense and musical, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme; metaphor frequency is high but controlled, with few if any mixed or clashing images. Repetitions (“mapping silence,” the empty camera, harbor motifs) are clearly intentional patterning rather than scaffold. Sentences vary in length and structure, and the rhythm aligns with the accumulative, meditative mode. The only minor limitation is that the sustained figurative pressure flirts with overrichness in places, which might be trimmed slightly for elite-publication tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled: most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious redundancy, and the imagery is coherent and polished. Metaphoric motifs recur purposefully (seeds as punctuation, heat as kiln vs. bomb) rather than as decorative flourishes. Line-level clarity remains high even in more baroque constructions, and the ending cadence lands cleanly. It edges toward purple in places, yet does not quite tip into muddle or self-indulgence.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is generally superb: sentences multitask (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme in one), and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is abundant but, for the most part, coherent and purposeful (“net learned to sing,” “silence had been folded too often,” “auroral sorrow”). Momentum remains strong despite lyric density, and grammar/usage are clean. The only meaningful constraint is occasional near-continuous metaphor where a plainer line might sharpen impact in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world, character, theme) with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is vivid and largely coherent, and the rhythm across the piece has a controlled, incantatory quality that suits the premise. A few metaphors (“tasting the metallic weather,” “the courtyard held silence like a full cup”) flirt with lushness but still serve mood rather than obscuring sense. Information flow remains clear throughout, with no loops or structural artifacts dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but highly controlled; nearly every line carries multiple jobs (image, emotion, world-building) without redundancy or muddled metaphor. Figurative language is fresh and coherent (“his fingers moved like rain remembering its fall” is emblematic), and there are no scaffold sentences or paraphrase loops dragging momentum. Rhythm varies effectively between longer lyric sentences and shorter, anchoring beats, especially around key turns with the brother and the final walk away. The closure image is crystal-clear despite the lyricism, which is difficult to pull off at this density.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, theme, motion) with almost no dead scaffolding, and the ear for rhythm is acute. Metaphors are generally coherent and apt, and there’s minimal paraphrase looping. The prose does flirt with high-density lyricism throughout—nearly every line is figurative—which might feel slightly over-saturated in places for some editors. A few strategic plainer sentences at moments of peak conceptual turn could sharpen impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: images are inventive, precise, and seldom feel like stock metaphors; sentences often do double or triple duty in setting, character, and theme. The pattern of lush figurative language is taught early and maintained with control, so it reads as aesthetic choice, not bloat. There are a few spots where metaphor stacks (“a bruise remembering a fist,” “chain singing as it learns it was never a chain”) approach saturation and risk softening impact. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, with little true redundancy or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is densely figurative yet remarkably clean: metaphors are fresh, coherent, and rarely feel strained (“brittle as paper breath,” “narrated like apocalypse for a spoon”). Information density is high; most sentences do double or triple duty in worldbuilding, tone, and character. Repetition patterns (“Behold,” turbines, hush) are deliberately patterned rather than looping, and there’s minimal scaffolding or synonym-churn. The only slight drag is that the unrelenting metaphorical richness risks blurring a few beats emotionally; judicious pruning at one or two moments could sharpen impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is very strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, theme, motion) with minimal scaffolding, and the rhythm varies effectively. Figurative density is high, but the metaphors are coherent with one another and governed by clear domains (weather, stone, breath, light) rather than clashing vehicles. There are no obvious loops or synonym churn; each sentence tends to introduce a new angle or pressure. The only arguable limitation is that the constant lushness leaves little room for stark contrast, but clarity and propulsion remain intact through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but purposeful; nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, character, and theme) without collapsing into muddle. Metaphors are coherent and sensorially grounded, aligned with glass, heat, breath, plants, and sound, with no noticeable mixed or dead comparisons. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the rhythm on the page flows well, especially in the opening and closing cadences. Line-level control directly supports the closure, with the final plant and bell images echoing earlier details in a sharpened way.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level writing is dense, musical, and controlled: metaphors are original and largely coherent, and almost every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme). Repetition patterns (“powerfully gentle,” “golden shadows,” bells/lens) are purposeful and pay off in closure rather than reading as loops. There is a high frequency of figurative language, but it reads as a taught pattern rather than purple excess, and clarity is rarely at risk. A touch of compression or pruning in a few especially ornate stretches could increase propulsion further, but as-is this is publishable at very competitive levels.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but remarkably clean: most sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, character) without sliding into muddle, and figurative language is consistent with the story’s lexicon of metal, light, and sky. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy; lines like “Good grief is a hinge too, and you never slam it because your fingers are in there” show precision and fresh metaphor rather than stock phrasing. Rhythm varies well, with shorter aphoristic beats punctuating longer, flowing descriptions to maintain momentum. A few abstract statements approach over-explanation, but they are anchored closely enough to image and action that they don’t drag.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is highly controlled: nearly every sentence does multiple jobs, blending image, world-building, and thematic charge. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“city sounded like coins washing in a sink,” “a mural hidden by a coat of rent”) without piling to the point of purple density. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic templates; rhythm and sentence variety support the accumulative structure. The only arguable limitation is that the uniformly lush style slightly mutes any tonal spike at moments that could bear sharper contour.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is highly crafted, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing action, revealing interiority, and thickening atmosphere at once. Figurative language is dense but rarely incoherent; images like “a ramp pretending to be stairs” and “teach me…to forget with fidelity” are fresh and legible. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum in a lyric mode. Occasionally the metaphor load edges toward saturation, but it does not obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and subtle character work simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent but not chaotic; metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (water/stone, vines/roots, birds/shadows), and I did not detect significant mixed or dead metaphors. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the story maintains momentum despite its lyric mode, moving efficiently between beats. A hair more variation in imagery (slightly fewer plant/bloom metaphors) could heighten impact by giving the most important ones more space to ring.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and cadence, metaphors are largely coherent and fresh, and almost every line carries dual weight in atmosphere and character. The prose balances density with clarity; even richly figurative phrases tend to clarify emotional stakes rather than obscure them. There are no meaningful loops, padding, or mechanical cadences, and key images (mist, stars, tail tip, brochure) are reused with evolved meaning rather than repetition. The only minor limit is that the figurative texture is nearly continuous, which might risk saturation for some readers, though it remains controlled here.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally excellent: high information density, strong verbs, and images that usually do multiple jobs (emotional, thematic, and worldbuilding). Motifs recur with variation rather than simple repetition, and there is little scaffolding or paraphrase-looping. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, especially early on, which occasionally risks purple density and could benefit from a few more plain beats for contrast. Despite this, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the closure image is clean and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, densely imagistic, and multitask (advancing action, world, and theme at once). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent, and motifs (warehouse, film, doors, thunder) are reused rather than scattered, minimizing purple-prose risk. There are no evident loops or scaffold sentences; almost every line earns its place in building atmosphere or concept. The only restraint on a higher score is the sheer density of imagery, which occasionally borders on saturation and could, for some readers, slightly soften the impact of peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, world-building) with minimal redundancy, and metaphors are generally coherent and fresh. There is a high density of figurative language, but it rarely tips into muddle; images like “a meteor combs the aurora like a hand through wet hair” and “marble lungs afraid of drawing breath” feel precise and vivid. A few lines edge toward decorative abstraction (“shadowed rapture,” “a calendar that had no dates”) without adding new pressure, which slightly softens momentum in places under a very demanding standard. Syntax and mechanics are clean, and the final image sequence lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is lush but remarkably disciplined: most metaphors do double duty for worldbuilding and theme, and sentence-level rhythm propels rather than stalls. There are no evident scaffolding loops or template cadences; each line adds a nuance to setting, stakes, or the guard’s stance. A few images approach saturation (“seeds learning to be embers, embers rehearsing to be rivers”), skating close to purple but remain coherent within the poem-like diction. Information density and clarity at the ending are strong, with the final paragraph cleanly crystallizing prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is very strong, with high information density and metaphors that are inventive yet clear (“rust like slow sorrow,” “notebooks written in the oil of patience”). Sentences vary in length and rhythm so the prose doesn’t fall into algorithmic beats, and almost every line advances either world, character, or theme. Figurative language is frequent but rarely feels purple or muddled, and there are no noticeable paraphrase loops. The only minor limitation is that the density of imagery slightly blunts urgency, keeping the piece in a reflective register even at its peak decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, images that generally cohere, and very little dead scaffolding; most sentences do at least two jobs (world, mood, or theme). Metaphoric density is high, but metaphors are rarely mixed or confusing, and rhythm reads intentional rather than mechanical. A few phrases echo conceptually (“a vigil in twilight,” “gently persistent”) without adding new pressure, which slightly softens momentum. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready, with only minor risk of over-saturation for some editors.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is outstanding: metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (teeth, cold, choir, circuitry), with very little scaffolding or repetition. Sentences routinely do double or triple duty—advancing atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously—with clean syntax and strong verb choices. The rhythm on the page supports the accumulative structure, and the final sentences land with clarity rather than vagueness. The only mild reservation is density: nearly every line is figurative, which a very conservative editor might thin slightly for breath, but it rarely obscures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is dense and inventive; most sentences perform multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and motion) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are frequent but rarely muddled, and rhythm varies enough to avoid sing-song despite the piece’s incantatory tendencies. There is some risk of over-saturation (“a childhood syllable surfaced like a drowning star”), but clarity and forward motion remain intact, including in the closure beat. No significant loops, filter-verb stacks, or structural artifacts impede reading, though a small trim of figurative layering could sharpen impact further for an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is excellent: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (world-building, mood, theme) and the figurative language is precise and coherent (“periodically eternal,” “hinges in the dark,” “shiver-sand”). There is no evident scaffolding, synonym loops, or strained metaphors; rhythm varies in length and structure in a way that supports the sea/tide motif and accumulative drive. The prose sustains density without blur, and crucial causal information (how coral bleaching shifts wave breaks and sand tongues) remains clear. A tiny fraction of lines lean into abstraction, but they’re grounded quickly enough that momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but mostly precise, with images like “the abandoned spaceport repair bay breathed like a sleeping leviathan” and “each nick a nebula” pulling double duty for mood and world-building. Figurative language is frequent yet rarely feels mixed or gratuitous, and sentences propel the scene rather than spiraling in place. There are no evident loops or scaffold phrases; each line tends to introduce a new facet of setting, emotion, or stakes. At times the accumulation of metaphors skirts the edge of excess, but it does not blur sense or obscure the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: images are fresh (“nails still hummed under new paint,” “amber rind opened like a wet book”), sentences carry multiple jobs, and there’s no noticeable scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language is dense but controlled, with a coherent vegetal/structural lexicon that supports theme rather than distracting from it. Syntax and paragraphing create natural momentum; the piece never bogs down despite its lyricism. Crucially, peak beats (vault, unsealing, the seedling’s emergence) remain crystal clear despite the metaphorical density.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with metaphors that are fresh, coherent, and purposeful (“the vent fans…a skein of air snarling into the old pitch of rotors”; the photograph “open like a wound that had decided to scar”). Sentences often do two or three jobs at once—advancing action, deepening character, and reinforcing motif—without redundancy. I see no significant loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors, and the final lines land cleanly without over-explaining. Rhythm and sentence variety support momentum and emotional contour.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is excellent: sentences are dense yet purposeful, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“She felt the tower anticipate collapse the way the body anticipates grief, in the throat before the tears start”). Figurative language is frequent but, crucially, not muddled; metaphors are coherent within a marine/light lexicon and rarely feel mixed or strained. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the closure image is sharp. A slight reduction in metaphor-per-sentence density in one or two mid-story paragraphs could sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, dense with information, and most metaphors are fresh and coherent within the story’s logic (“metronome that ticks when scared, then drags, then flowers quiet”). Figurative language is frequent but not random; it accrues into a unified aesthetic around time, ink, and wind. There’s no notable scaffolding, repetition, or muddled imagery that blurs causality or the closing beats. The only minor check is that a few dense lines verge on purple but remain controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing double duty for image and meaning (“a braid of tenderness and infrastructure, desire mapped in cables”). Metaphors are consistent with the world’s logic (archives, snow, circuitry, maintenance), and there is minimal redundancy or scaffold. Rhythm varies well between longer, dreamy lines and tighter, declarative beats at key turns. A very slight risk of over-saturation in figurative language keeps it just below the highest band, though clarity and momentum are never truly impaired.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense but highly efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without slack or obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and tonally unified; metaphors extend a small set of motifs instead of spinning off wildly. Syntax varies enough to keep momentum, and there are no noticeable loops, mixed metaphors, or clarity breaks, including at closure. The only restraint on a perfect score is the sheer saturation of imagery, which edges toward maximalist but remains disciplined.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is unusually strong: sentences are packed with information and image, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“calm is a net you mend every hour” exemplifies this economy). Figurative language is abundant but mostly coherent, extending central motifs (sound, rails, tides) rather than spinning off mixed or dead metaphors. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; each paragraph advances atmosphere and stakes. The only limitation is that the near-constant metaphorical pressure slightly flattens dynamic contrast, shaving a bit off maximum sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but purposeful; most sentences carry multiple functions (image, theme, character) without collapsing into purple muddle. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and motif-linked (ink, gravity, tides, orbits), and there is little evident synonym churn or scaffolding. Rhythm varies nicely between long, sinuous lines and short declaratives like “Nothing comes except the wind that smells like snow and old photographs.” A few metaphors (e.g., “wrapped the world in ink like a gull in netting”) slightly risk overextension but remain controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is densely figurative yet controlled; most images are fresh, coherent, and doing multiple jobs at once (e.g., “amber is resin that could have let go but decided to hold”). There is no notable synonym-churn or scaffolding; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or thematic pattern. Repetition (“meteor hush,” tethered stars, letters) is purposeful and reweighted, not looped. If anything, a few readers might find the sustained metaphor density rich, but it never significantly muddies clarity or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is richly crafted, with high information density: most sentences do double or triple duty in setting, theme, and character (“The air held lilac unease, delicate but sure, like dusk deciding whether to commit to night”). Syntax varies, and there is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and legible; only a couple of phrases flirt with purple without obscuring sense. The overall momentum holds despite the lyric density, but the near-constant metaphorical pressure slightly blurs hierarchy of emphasis, preventing a higher score under an elite standard.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent: high information density, varied syntax, and figurative language that carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) in each sentence. There is a lot of metaphor, but it follows a coherent imagistic logic (fire/ash/stone/steel/warm-cold) rather than piling mixed comparisons. Momentum holds despite lyricism; almost every line either turns the emotional screw or thickens the ritual logic. A slight sense of saturation—nearly every sentence carrying a simile or metaphor—keeps this just shy of absolute top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is highly polished: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but coherent and patterned; synesthetic images stay internally consistent and rarely feel mixed or strained. There are no noticeable loops, template cadences, or clarity breaks, and the prose maintains momentum despite being meditative. The only minor limitation is that such sustained lyricism flattens dynamic contrast slightly—there are few plain, sharp lines to cut against the richness when pressure peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs, advancing emotion, world, and concept simultaneously, and the rhythm varies pleasingly. Figurative language is dense but generally coherent and purposeful, with recurring images (fish-like bulbs, veins of rain, corridors of light) building a consistent texture. There are moments of near-purple abstraction (“shy electricity,” “moss that remembers footsteps”) that risk saturation, yet clarity and momentum are preserved and there’s little genuine redundancy. The closure beat is clean and un-muddled, with the geode’s dullness and “willowglass hope” landing crisply.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) with minimal scaffolding, and rhythm varies enough to keep the piece from feeling monotonous. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with few if any mixed or strained metaphors; “factually mystical” and “a breathable story” strike particularly effective notes. There is little redundancy or synonym churn, and action remains clear even in the higher-tempo storm beat. A handful of sentences edge toward abstraction, but they don’t materially blur causality or the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is densely imagistic yet generally precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“The hush is not empty; it is unearthed silence, the kind that remembers it once was thunder”). Figurative language is consistent in register and domain, and there is little to no paraphrase-loop or scaffolding; the prose propels rather than stalls. The only reason this doesn’t clear into the very top band is occasional near-platitudinous phrasing and mild metaphor stacking that slightly softens the sharpness of a few beats.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence earns its place by advancing mood, character, or stakes, and the syntax has pleasing variety and musicality. Figurative language is frequent but usually precise and original; images like microfilm “curled like fern” and water accepting secrets “the way soil accepts seed” clarify rather than blur. The only limitation is a slight risk of saturation—almost every line is charged, which occasionally edges toward decorative lushness in what is otherwise a high-pressure, covert meeting. Trimming one or two metaphors at peak beats would heighten impact, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is highly crafted: most sentences do multiple jobs (image, mood, theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The metaphors are mostly fresh and coherent, and rhythm varies effectively to match the calm, accumulative pressure. A few images (“spindrift serenity,” “wet strand of moonlight”) flirt with purple but remain legible and tonally unified, not obstructive. There’s little to no paraphrase looping or mechanical cadence, and the final lines land with clarity and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but rarely redundant, and most images do double duty for atmosphere and theme (“Fractured timelines lived here, hairlines in glass, each catching light at a slightly different angle” is emblematic). Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and disciplined—no mixed metaphors or physics-breaking vehicles—and the rhythm carries the reader forward. There are almost no scaffold sentences or paraphrase-loops; each move introduces a new facet of the place, the magic, or her process. The one restraint on a perfect score is the sheer uniformity of lyric intensity, which occasionally risks saturation rather than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is rich, image-dense, and generally precise, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology (“the lantern breathes like someone waking in a spare bed and finding it enough”). There are no real loops or scaffolding sentences; momentum carries smoothly through the journey and the lighting. However, figurative language is present in nearly every sentence, which occasionally edges toward saturation and slightly blurs impact—some images could be cut without loss. Because this intensity never quite muddles clarity, it reads as slightly overwrought rather than structurally damaging.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush yet mostly economical; images often do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“hoopprints across gold” resolving into a word for shelter). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and patterned, avoiding mixed metaphors or overt purple excess. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and there are no evident loops or scaffolding lines that restate content without adding pressure. The only limitation is a uniformly high metaphor density that occasionally risks numbing impact, though it never seriously harms clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, and action) and the rhythm varies enough to sustain momentum in a lyric mode. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and grounded in the scene; recurring phrases like “prismatic quiet” and “keeper of secrets” feel motif-like rather than repetitive scaffolding. A few choices—most notably the repeated literal phrase “through public art installation”—jar slightly against the otherwise fluid, image-driven register. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready, with only minor tonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense yet economical; nearly every sentence advances character, world, and theme simultaneously with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is vivid but controlled—extended metaphors about sound and celestial patterns are coherent and pattern-consistent, avoiding purple excess. There are no noticeable loops, synonym churn, or structural tics; sentence variety and paragraphing sustain momentum despite the lyric mode. The final third maintains clarity and pressure, with the last few images (posters in rain, dawning quad, chart annotation) landing cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush yet purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“doors into elaborate shrugs,” “a tube for listening to gravities”). Rhythm varies nicely between long, sinuous lines and shorter grounded beats, sustaining momentum despite the lyric mode. Figurative language is dense but coherent; a few metaphors verge on ornamental rather than necessary, preventing an even higher score. Causality and choreography remain clear throughout, including at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush yet mostly precise, with high information density—many sentences do triple duty in setting, character, and theme (e.g., “I draw the way riverbeds remember water, by tracing what flowed and what stayed”). Rhythm varies well, and there are few if any true redundancies or scaffolding lines. The main limitation is a near-constant use of figurative language, some of it aphoristic, which occasionally risks purple saturation rather than building a clear crescendo; a bit more spareness around key turns would enhance impact. Nonetheless, clarity remains strong and the closure image is not muddied.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is lush but controlled: nearly every sentence carries multiple layers of work (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent, with a clear atmospheric palette of dampness, fog, and machinery; I saw no mixed metaphors that muddled sense. Momentum holds despite lyric density, aided by short, declarative pivots at structural beats (“Because you misplaced the switch, I said, and because your posters keep lying.”). If anything, one or two images (“smelling like wet bread”) could be trimmed without loss, but they don’t blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, varied syntax, and metaphors that usually carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without muddle. Rhythm largely tracks emotional pressure, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences. However, figurative language is extremely dense—nearly every line carries an image—so there are moments where the lushness risks distraction (“a moon shedding languages,” “horizon melts into squares of pale approvals”). For a top-tier venue this is publishable but might benefit from a few targeted trims for breath and emphasis.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level work is dense yet purposeful: most sentences do double or triple duty in image, theme, and character. Figurative language is frequent but rarely overwrought, and key metaphors (“Investors withdrew with soft apologies that sounded like tents zipped shut in rain”) are clear and grounded. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and rhythm modulates well from declarative business beats to more incantatory reflections. A few images flirt with saturation, but they do not blur sense or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is high: images are fresh (“charts breathed faintly,” “glyphs like migrating birds”), and most sentences do multiple jobs (world-build, characterize, and carry theme). The density of figurative language is notable but feels largely controlled and patterned rather than purple; momentum is maintained despite the lyricism. There are very few redundancies or scaffolding lines, and grammar and sequencing are clean. A slightly lighter touch on explicit thematic restatements could sharpen the overall impact, but the prose remains publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is highly polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) with very little scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythm varies effectively across the scene. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and pattern-consistent (orchestrated around water, war, and orchards), so it reads as deliberate texture rather than churn. Information flow is clear even in the most lyrical stretches, and the final images (spent seed, settled apples, pocketed coin) are sharp and unfussy. The only small drawback is near-uniform figurative density; a few plainer lines might better frame the peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, multi-tasking sentences, and largely precise, fresh metaphors that advance both worldbuilding and emotion. Rhythm varies well, and there is little to no scaffolding, synonym churn, or paraphrase looping; nearly every line introduces new pressure or texture. The figurative register is consistently elevated but controlled, with only occasional risk of overload, yet clarity of action and stakes remains intact. The closure image is clean and unblurred by purple excess, maintaining momentum through the final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, figurative language is mostly precise, and nearly every line does double-duty for atmosphere and character. A few moments risk decorative excess, but metaphors are generally coherent and contribute to world-building rather than smearing clarity. The final cadence (“not to decorate, but to remind the dark it was seen”) neatly reweights prior imagery without feeling overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences vary rhythmically, carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, theme), and rarely feel redundant or like scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent—metaphors about sound, stone, and applause form a consistent system rather than a jumble. There are no evident loops, syntactic templates, or register glitches that blunt the closure beat; the prose remains clear even at its most lyrical. If anything, a few images skirt the edge of lushness, but they still serve momentum and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, theme, emotion) with minimal redundancy, and the rhythms and parallel structures feel intentional rather than templated. Metaphors are abundant but internally coherent (rails as reeds, pressure as passage, seed as clause), and they reinforce a consistent semantic field. There is occasional conceptual echo (“kindly methodical” repeated, several bridge metaphors), but not enough to stall momentum or obscure closure. The density approaches purple in spots, yet clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is unusually strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and conceptual work—without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative density is high, but metaphors are consistently apt to the sea/metal/time palette, and syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm alive. A few lines flirt with over-richness (“spines breathe like sleeping seals,” “foam-bright drawers”) stacked close together, which slightly risks saturation. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved throughout, and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush but remarkably efficient: most sentences do multiple jobs, marrying atmosphere, theme, and action without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. Rhythm varies well, and key beats (“Light did not burst; it inhaled…”) are given room without bogging momentum. There is a very high density of figurative language, which occasionally risks feeling ornamental, but clarity and propulsion remain intact throughout. No significant loops or syntactic artifacts dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally controlled: nearly every sentence does multiple jobs (advancing action, deepening character, and charging motif) without evident scaffolding. Figurative language is dense but patterned and legible, with few, if any, mixed metaphors; repetitions like “daringly methodical” and “bathroom graffiti wisdom” function as deliberate refrains rather than loops. Syntax varies smoothly, and there’s strong auditory rhythm (“cheer in a dead-end key,” “nuzzles its rail-bed grief”) that supports mood and momentum. Any risk of purple prose is offset by the precision and consistency of imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and action) with minimal redundancy, and images like “joy had learned to wear armor and still dance” or the quill “collecting mist-light like quiet lightning” are striking and coherent. Metaphoric saturation is high, yet the pattern is established early and rarely obscures who is doing what, where. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum flows smoothly despite the lyric mode. The only restraint against a higher score is that the constant figurative pressure occasionally risks feeling uniform rather than dynamically modulated.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) and the figurative language is vivid and coherent to the world’s logic. Phrases like “gravity brushed its strings with a thousand soft eyebrows” and “coffee cooled to honesty” are striking without collapsing clarity, and there is little to no paraphrase looping or scaffolding. That said, the density of metaphor is very high throughout, and in a few spots it verges on ornamental rather than strictly necessary under peak pressure, which slightly blunts momentum. A touch more spareness around the climax could make the emotional beat land even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly polished, with strong information density: most sentences carry atmosphere, character, and worldbuilding at once. Imagery is generally coherent and fresh (“cloths folded like prayers,” “radio… coughed a veil of snow”), with no significant mixed metaphors or loops. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, which risks slight overrichness; a few more plain, grounding lines might sharpen peaks by contrast. Rhythm and clarity still hold throughout, including in the closure beat, so the density never quite tips into opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are varied in rhythm and structure, and metaphors are generally fresh, coherent, and multi-functional (“forgiveness had turned me from a stone into a door” does character, theme, and image work at once). Information density is high with minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism. A few figurative runs edge toward decorative—there are many grapes, rivers, and seeds in close succession—without always adding new pressure, which slightly dulls impact. Nonetheless, clarity never breaks, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, character, theme) without redundancy, and the rhythm moves smoothly between compressed summary and slowed, charged moments. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent (“the world were an eyelid and this glass were its pupil missing on purpose”), with no mixed metaphors that blur sense. There is minimal scaffold or repetition; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. The density is high enough that one or two plainer, grounding beats of physical sensation might ease cognitive load, but clarity and propulsion are not harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense with metaphor, but the imagery is coherent and pattern-driven (time as ribbon and knots, ripples as paths, vanishing as loosening), avoiding mixed or confusing figures. Sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and thematic shading—without obvious scaffolding or repetition; there are no paraphrase loops that stall momentum. Rhythm and syntax are varied and purposeful, creating a chant-like flow in some stretches and tightening around decisions. The only slight constraint on an even higher score is that the sustained figurative richness flirts with saturation in places, though it never tips into true purple or obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is outstanding: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and images that generally pull double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“a black mirror that knows more of sky than sky knows of itself”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly clean and coherent; rhythm varies and there’s no obvious template cadence or synonym churn. A few lines flirt with purple or overt aphorism but don’t meaningfully obscure sense or dull the closure beat. Overall, the prose is polished enough for immediate publication with only the slightest risk of ornament tipping over in a few spots.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.3)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries dual or triple duty (worldbuilding, character, theme) without padding, and rhythm varies with scene needs. Figurative language is abundant but controlled, with metaphors that are both coherent and voice-specific; I see no mixed or self-contradictory images that blur sense. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or template cadences bogging momentum, and the final lines re-energize earlier motifs without over-explaining. Grammar, sequencing, and pronoun references are clean, making even dense sentences easy to parse.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is unusually controlled: images are fresh, information-dense, and multi-functional, advancing atmosphere, world, and theme simultaneously. There is a high density of figurative language, but it forms a coherent palette (lanterns, light, weather, silver, tides) and rarely feels like synonym churn or decorative piling. Syntax varies, transitions are smooth, and crucial beats (finding the matching key tag, voicing the vow) arrive in clean, uncluttered lines. The overall lushness approaches the threshold of overwriting in places, but it does not impede clarity or closure, so the piece sits just shy of absolute top tier here.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy, and the prose passes a read-aloud rhythm test. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and on-theme; images like “black dew” of doubt and the universe “remembering itself” feel precise rather than ornamental. There are no noticeable loops, mixed metaphors, or copy-level errors, and momentum is preserved despite the lyric mode. The only slight reservation is that sustained lushness leaves little room for contrast, but it doesn’t blur closure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is highly controlled: sentences carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffold or repetition, and rhythm varies to match pressure. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and internally consistent (“a wound made of horizon,” “a choir of ice”), with no major mixed metaphors. There’s minimal paraphrase looping, and transitions between images remain legible. The sheer density of imagery edges toward overwrought in spots, which slightly softens impact at peak beats but does not materially obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is exceptionally clean and musical, with nearly every sentence doing double duty for atmosphere and meaning without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined; metaphors are coherent, fresh, and rarely strain (“sounded like a promise failing midword” is exemplary). There are no noticeable loops or template cadences, and rhythm modulates naturally across the piece. Line-level craft actively heightens the closure image—the modest silver ripple and open doors—rather than smothering it.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is tightly crafted, with high information density—most sentences do double duty in atmosphere and character or theme, and there is little to no paraphrase looping. Syntax varies smoothly, supporting the contemplative pressure without becoming monotonous, and figurative language is coherent and thematically aligned (water, undertow, breathing reservoir). There are no noticeable line-level artifacts or overstuffed metaphors that blur sense, and the final lines land with clarity and rhythm. The lyricism is lush but disciplined, never bogging down momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most metaphors (“a bell of winter inside summer,” “waterfall spelling simple mercies”) are both fresh and clear. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; images interrelate via consistent sensory and conceptual fields (color, braiding, memory, maps). There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the closure image is sharp rather than muddied. It flirts with over-richness at moments, but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and imagery that is inventive yet coherent (“rope veins,” “needle working a wound,” “plaiting rope from night”). There is a lot of figurative language, but it serves character and mood rather than turning purple or muddling action. Pivotal beats (the turbulence, docking, final exchange) remain clear despite lyric intensity. I see no significant scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic artifacts that drag momentum or obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but precise, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Metaphors are fresh and internally consistent (“a key fits a wound,” “clouds wrote and wiped the world below,” “names loosened like threads in seawater”) and rarely feel strained. Rhythm varies well across the piece, and there are no line-level artifacts that muddy causality or the closing image. The one arguable risk is sustained figurative intensity, but here it reads as intentional texture rather than purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful metaphor, and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Images like “a single bead the color of bruise and moon” and “the annex answered by breathing cedar and ozone” are fresh and coherent, not mixed. There is a high figurative load, but it’s pattern-consistent and doesn’t obscure sense or causality. A few abstractions (“Innovation did not like crowds”) flirt with aphorism, yet they are grounded by adjacent concrete detail and do not blunt the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is lush and information-dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and thematic work at once). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and fresh (“notes wobble like lanterns in fog,” “machines macerate old silence into mulch”), and paraphrase loops are minimal. A few metaphors verge on ornamental or slightly abstract (“true haunting in their fidelity to absence”), but they don’t obscure causality or the closure image. Rhythm on the page reads controlled rather than algorithmic, sustaining momentum across the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is densely figurative yet controlled; most metaphors are clean, fresh, and multi-functional (“the garden accepts this method the way ice accepts a leaf, with the patient glint of captured motion”). Rhythm varies well, with longer sinuous sentences interspersed with shorter crystallizing lines, sustaining momentum despite the meditative mode. Information density is high—sentences routinely do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion—without obvious loops or scaffolding. The only restraint is that figurative texture is nearly continuous, which edges toward saturation but never quite muddies sense.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: nearly every sentence does multiple jobs (setting, character, and theme) while preserving forward motion. Figurative density is high but largely controlled; images such as “fireflies with broken maps” or the crozier becoming an “embered question mark” are precise and non-redundant, and there are no serious mixed metaphors or logical breaks. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the prose trusts the reader and avoids explanatory drag. A small deduction reflects how close the piece comes to saturation—another layer of ornament would tip into excess—but as is, clarity and cadence remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level work is lush, inventive, and tightly constructed, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Information density is high but generally clear, and the recurring metaphor set (film, radio, music, gravity) stays controlled rather than muddled. There is some risk of over-saturation—nearly every line reaches for a striking image, which can dull impact and leave less room for plain, grounding detail. Even so, there are few if any true artifacts, redundancies, or mixed metaphors that impede understanding, keeping this solidly in publishable territory.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally do more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent but aligned and rarely feels mixed; the metaphoric system of time/schedules/astral patterns holds. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences, and the cadence supports the accumulative drive. If anything, a few metaphors might breathe more with slight pruning, but momentum and clarity remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is consistently high-caliber: dense images (“ivy finds corners on stone,” “volcano under water singing compliance”) do multiple jobs without collapsing into mixed metaphor. Rhythm varies well in a line-by-line read, and nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, concept, or character. There’s some risk of over-saturation—almost every line is figurative—but clarity is preserved and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding phrases. A touch more sparseness at key emotional beats might sharpen impact further, but the line-level craft is already publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but clean: most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, characterization, and thematic resonance) without scaffold or obvious redundancy. Metaphors are largely coherent, extended across the piece (edges, pressure, horizons) rather than piled on haphazardly; rhythm varies and supports the contemplative mode. A few lines verge on high-poetic abstraction, but they remain anchored enough in concrete imagery (kelp shadows, silt drift, chain weight) to avoid purple drift. There are no noticeable loops or mechanical artifacts to dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly polished, with images that are both surprising and legible (“stack of catalogs slumps like exhausted mailmen,” “steam sketches a question mark around his face”) and sentences that usually carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and motion at once). Rhythm varies well between long, drifting lines and tighter, declarative beats at turns. While figurative density is high, it almost never tips into muddle or redundancy, and momentum is preserved. A handful of metaphors (“pocketed sparrow,” “phones begin to tremble”) echo bird/flight motifs without overbuilding a single symbol, but another revision pass could trim one or two ornamental images to reach absolute peak clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is highly polished: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without redundancy, and figurative language is fresh, coherent, and thematically apt (“The entrance squeeze pinched my ribs like a hand I owed money”). Rhythm varies; there’s no template cadence or synonym-churn, and the prose moves forward even when lyric. The only arguable drawback is sustained density of imagery, but it remains controlled and clear, never obscuring causality or the closure beat. Grammar and sequencing are clean, with no visible scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are mostly precise, multi-functional, and rarely feel overwrought given the lyric mode. Sentences often do double duty—advancing action while deepening mood or theme—and the rhythm supports shifts in pressure. A few near-repetitions (“I came back to fetch wisdom from failure”) flirt with redundancy but can be read as deliberate motif rather than scaffold. Figurative language remains coherent and physically grounded, keeping closure sharp rather than blurred.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is remarkably strong: nearly every sentence does double-duty in advancing action and image, and figurative language is inventive and coherent (“a curse is only a contract without punctuation”). Rhythm varies, paragraphs carry distinct moves, and crucial information is never obscured by metaphor. The only restraint on a perfect score is the sustained density of imagery, which, while largely successful, occasionally flirts with overload and could fatigue some readers at elite-publication scrutiny. There are no visible loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors that harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush yet controlled: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious loops or scaffolding. Metaphor density is high, but vehicles are coherent, rarely mixed, and often startlingly apt; the narrative remains clear despite the lyricism. There are almost no redundant lines or mechanical cadences, and transitions between beats are smooth. The only restraint on a higher score is that a few back-to-back metaphors (“compass needles drunk on auroras,” “staircase of vertebrae descending into black peppermint”) briefly risk saturating the reader’s processing bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is densely figurative yet largely controlled, with most metaphors coherent and doing multiple jobs (“locust shell…a tiny cathedral of absence,” halos as copper leaves that literally react to sound). Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line adds new pressure or image. A few formulations flirt with abstraction (“map of wounds that become windows”) and could be pruned or grounded, but they do not obscure causality or the closure image. Overall, line-level craft is very strong and publication-ready with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is strong: high information density, vivid imagery, and minimal redundancy, with a pleasing rhythmic variety. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent (“maps hold their breath,” “coins rolling after closing,” “librarian of hurt”). There are no significant scaffolding sentences or paraphrase loops, and syntax remains clear even in more baroque lines. The prose occasionally flirts with lushness, but it doesn’t materially obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is highly polished: dense but not redundant, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (image, mood, and motion). Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and thematically aligned; metaphors (serpent train, sleeping constellations, time as a lattice) support the central concerns rather than distracting. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or cadence templates, and the final lines land with crystalline precision. If anything, the sustained richness edges close to saturation, but it remains controlled and readable.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is lush and mostly precise; metaphors are coherent within a sustained geometry/weather/coastline system, and nearly every sentence does double duty for mood and theme. There’s high figurative density, yet it rarely feels redundant or confusing, and the closure image (salt wrung into snow, letters on shoulders, counting heartbeats) lands cleanly. A few moments verge on saturation where an elite editor might trim for even greater impact, but they don’t materially obscure momentum or causality. Syntax and punctuation are clean, with no visible scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is very strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (image, theme, motion), and there is minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and purposeful, with only occasional border-line purple moments (“improbable beginnings,” “sleep-starved negatives”) that might be slightly pruned for maximal sharpness. Rhythm modulates appropriately, and the closure sentences land cleanly with clear images and no muddle. A touch more variation between highly figurative and plainer lines at key emotional pivots could heighten contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with many doing double duty for image and psychology. However, figurative language is present in nearly every line, and while most metaphors are coherent and striking, the accumulation occasionally verges on over-rich, leaving little room for plainer contrast. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; momentum is maintained despite the lyric density. No key beat is obscured by muddled imagery, but a touch more austerity would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but controlled: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without notable redundancy or muddled metaphor. Rhythm varies with longer, sinuous lines broken by precise, declarative beats (“Truth can be a bruise or a bell, and both were ready in me.”). Figurative language is coherent within its sea/orchard/ledger system and rarely feels ornamental. I see no significant scaffold, loops, or clarity issues that would stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush yet controlled: most sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, character, theme) and the rhythm varies between long, braided lines and shorter emphatic statements. Imagery is dense but largely coherent and thematically aligned; metaphors recur with pattern (light, dust, margins, shadows) rather than feeling random. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the final lines land with clarity and weight. At times, the relentless figurative texture slightly blurs edges of action—especially around the council’s shift—but not enough to harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush, original, and highly controlled; many lines do multiple jobs at once (e.g., “a scent like bread learning to rise” simultaneously evokes warmth, process, and renewal). There are no obvious loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffolding, and the closure image is clear. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, occasionally risking saturation and leaving little room for plainer sentences to sharpen contrast, which slightly limits readability at elite-level scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, information is dense, and nearly every line pulls double duty for atmosphere and story. Metaphor saturation is high, but images are largely coherent, precise, and legible, avoiding muddle even in peak beats. There are no obvious repetition loops or scaffolding phrases, and syntax remains clear despite the lyricism. A few phrasings flirt with purple, yet they don’t materially obscure cause/effect or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is densely imagistic yet precise, with very few wasted sentences; metaphors are mostly clean, fresh, and internally consistent (“rain eats old limestone like a slow animal with a patient tongue” is an exemplary line). Rhythm is varied and purposeful, moving smoothly between long, flowing sentences and shorter declaratives to manage pace. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic tics, and grammar and usage are clean. A handful of lines cluster metaphor upon metaphor, nudging toward purple but never quite tipping into muddle, which is the only minor constraint at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but purposeful; most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, theme, character) without collapsing into muddle. Figurative language is original and coherent, with very few strained or mixed metaphors. There’s little scaffold or repetition—each paragraph adds a new facet of image or thought, and momentum is maintained despite the reflective mode. The only minor drag is that intensity of metaphor is nearly constant, leaving less room for sharp rhythmic contrast at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences do double or triple duty, blending atmosphere, character, and theme without scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and the read-aloud rhythm is musical. Figurative language is inventive and largely coherent, with recurring metaphors (breath, wires, flowers, lungs) instead of scattershot images. There is mild risk of over-saturation—metaphors appear in a large majority of lines—which can blur emphasis in peak beats, though comprehension remains intact. Trimming one or two slightly redundant flourishes would sharpen impact but the prose as-is is well above typical publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly polished, with varied sentence rhythm, rich but precise imagery, and almost no scaffolding or repetition; most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, theme) simultaneously. Metaphor density is high, yet the vehicles are largely coherent and mutually reinforcing, supporting the accumulative texture rather than obscuring sense. A few phrases verge on purple (“breath feels borrowed from cold saints,” “snow seeding from above becomes a slow confetti”), but they do not muddle causality or closure. Overall momentum is maintained cleanly across the ten rises.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, densely metaphorical, and largely precise, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence advances image, character, and theme simultaneously. There is some risk of ornamental excess—metaphor appears in almost every line—but the pattern is taught early and maintained coherently, so momentum rarely stalls. Syntax is varied enough to avoid a mechanical drumbeat, and key beats (“The captain reels us close...”, the blank lines) land clearly. For an elite venue, a touch more spareness in a few mid-paragraph metaphors could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but highly controlled: most sentences perform multiple functions (setting, interiority, theme) without redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and well-grounded in the established metaphoric logic (breath, grain, rings, weather, music) so it does not blur sense. Rhythm varies and supports momentum, with no obvious template cadences or synonym loops, and grammar/usage are clean. The final lines land crisply, reactivating earlier images without over-explaining them.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is densely figurative but largely avoids muddle; most metaphors are apt, surprising, and multi-functional, advancing mood, world, and character at once. Sentence rhythms vary nicely, creating a gentle propulsion even in a contemplative scene, and there is very little redundancy or scaffolding. A handful of lines flirt with purple (“my ribs were lantern slats and my hands rang like bowls”), though they remain within the established register and do not obscure action. Overall, information density and clarity are high, with only minor risk of over-richness.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences carry multiple layers of work (image, world-building, and interiority) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned—driftwood, harbor, clocks, frost, and tide all pull in the same conceptual direction, and none directly contradict each other. Density is high but controlled; while nearly every line is figurative, the pattern is taught early and sustained, so it reads as intentional lyricism rather than purple sprawl. There are no significant clarity lapses or mechanical errors, and the final sentences land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but purposeful: most sentences do at least two jobs (world-building plus emotion, or image plus theme) without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and thematically linked (arches, bells, blooms, threads), avoiding mixed metaphors or overwrought muddle. Rhythm is varied and the closing cadence (“we rang… and Lio sighed like a tree that had found its grove again”) is strong. There’s a slight risk of uniform lushness blurring edge in high-pressure beats, but it never quite tips into purple or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but precise, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character while keeping momentum. Figurative language is rich yet coherent; motifs like hush, gears, and tide recur without feeling repetitive or muddled. There are no evident scaffold sentences or synonym loops; rhythm and syntax vary in a way that supports the accumulating pressure. The final lines land cleanly, reactivating earlier phrases (“beautifully flawed machine”) without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are varied in rhythm, densely informative, and metaphorically adventurous without collapsing into muddle. Most images do double-duty for mood and worldbuilding (orchard “whispered to the rocks about broken promises,” birds “clicked like rake teeth”). There’s minimal scaffold or redundancy; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. A few moments of stacked figurative language edge toward lushness, but they remain under control and do not blur causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is highly controlled: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (setting, character, theme) without noticeable redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and patterned (braids, seams, loops, orchestration) rather than florid; images like “loosened grief hung over the water like a mist” and “swallows stitched the air with black seams” are vivid and apt. Syntax and paragraphing vary to maintain momentum in a reflective piece, and there are no grammatical or logical slips that blur causality. The density skirts the edge of lushness, but clarity and propulsion remain intact, including at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: high information density, inventive metaphors that generally cohere, and almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The rhythm of sentences and paragraphs supports the accumulative build, with clauses doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, theme) at once. There is mild risk of metaphor saturation—nearly every line bears an image—which may slightly blur sharpness for some readers, especially around the midsection. Still, clarity at the hinge and closure remains intact, so this reads as lush rather than undisciplined.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: high information density, images doing double duty for setting and emotion, and very little scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are fresh and internally consistent (puddles as maps, memories as grain needing sandpaper, bowls as “sturdy brittle”), and the syntax varies enough to maintain momentum without calling attention to itself. The prose sustains a rich figurative texture without tipping into muddle or obscuring causality. A few lines stack abstractions (“what storms left behind when mouths could not say sorry”) but they remain anchored enough in concrete images to avoid drag.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished: sentences are information-dense, often doing atmospheric, thematic, and narrative work simultaneously (“Its voice counts, eins, dos, trois, quattro, as the astronomical clock tower nods in pleased agreement”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, with mechanical and musical metaphors reinforcing each other rather than clashing. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum is maintained despite the lyrical mode. At times the density borders on lush, yet it never quite tips into obscurity or purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is consistently strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that usually pull double duty for mood and theme (“the lab felt vacuumed,” “a door never knocked”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme; there are few if any true mixed metaphors, and momentum rarely stalls despite the lyrical density. I see minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and the closure image is crisp. The only restraint on a higher score is that the saturation of metaphor occasionally risks overrichness, which slightly blurs immediacy in places.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-by-line craft is high: sentences are varied in length and structure, metaphors are mostly precise and mutually reinforcing, and there’s strong information density with little scaffolding or redundancy. Almost every line advances character, atmosphere, or world logic, and key beats are shown rather than summarized. The risk of purple prose is managed well, though a few moments skirt the edge of saturation, given how many sentences carry figurative loads. Rhythm supports escalation, tightening around the hour’s end and relaxing slightly in the closing city-walk, maintaining momentum without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is finely wrought and largely free of redundancy, with high information density—most sentences do multiple jobs (image, emotion, theme). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and apt, and there are very few paraphrase loops; repetition tends to be structural or thematic rather than accidental. The rhythm breathes appropriately, easing when the world wants a pulse and tightening around the moments of making. The main limitation for the very top band is the sheer density of metaphor, which occasionally risks feeling ornamental rather than absolutely necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often do double or triple duty in image, theme, and character. Metaphors are original and mostly coherent (“eyes…like someone counting rain by its absences,” “hum softened on the long diagonals”) and the prose maintains clarity despite its lyric richness. There is minor risk of saturation—many lines carry figurative weight, which might be fractionally pruned for maximal sharpness—but momentum does not noticeably stall. The final line lands cleanly and recharges earlier motifs without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are vivid, syntax varied, and most sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, character, theme) without padding. Metaphors are largely fresh and coherent with the sound/silence motif (“tone that coils like smoke,” “pages thin as moth lungs”). The prose edges toward lushness, but repetition or scaffold sentences are largely absent, and momentum through the ritual and reading is maintained. A touch more sparing use of high-intensity figurative phrasing in already-charged moments could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level writing is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and interiority at once). Figurative language is abundant yet mostly coherent and thematically unified around motion, roots, and breath, avoiding mixed-metaphor muddle. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; rhythm varies enough to keep the lyric mode from droning. A few constructions (“I journalize as I work”) risk slight stiffness, but they do not impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are vivid, and most lines pull multiple weights (worldbuilding, mood, and theme simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and grounded, contributing to a clear textural pattern rather than feeling like random ornament. Redundancy and scaffolding are minimal; momentum is preserved despite the density of description. The only restraint to a higher score is occasional near-purple layering where successive metaphors slightly risk blurring rather than sharpening the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: sentences are varied, dense with information, and almost always do double duty for atmosphere and function. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and thematically coherent (canyons, corridors, currents), with no mixed metaphors or purple drag. There are essentially no scaffold sentences or paraphrase loops; rhythm is measured yet propulsive in step with a methodical investigation. The final third, including the landing and post-landing inventory, remains crystal clear despite lyricism, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are generally precise, metaphors coherent, and nearly every sentence adds either world texture or thematic pressure with minimal scaffolding. The repeated oscillation motifs and sound/light metaphors build an intentional pattern rather than a clutter of mixed images. There is a high density of figurative language across the entire piece, which mildly blunts impact by offering few stretches of plainer prose for contrast. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the closing lines land cleanly without syntactic or tonal stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence does double duty in atmosphere and character, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythms support the accumulating pressure. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically aligned (loom, shuttle, ledgers, thresholds), avoiding mixed or confusing metaphors. There is mild risk of overload in places (“Avalanches here begin in whispers, but the silence comes down like a house”), but it doesn’t obscure causality or closure. Tightening one or two of the densest metaphors or slightly varying the texture in the midsection could sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: nearly every sentence does double or triple duty (world, character, theme) without obvious scaffold or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but controlled, with motifs (rotation, mirrors, limits, maps, vanishing stars) coherently interrelated rather than mixed. Syntax varies and supports momentum; there are no noticeable loops, clumsy filters, or grammatical slips. The rare risks of abstraction do not blur cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose shows strong rhythmic control and high information density; many lines accomplish character insight, worldbuilding, and mood simultaneously (“her face already half bright and half memory”). Figurative language is vivid and largely coherent, with recurring motifs (tuning fork, sap, germination) rather than scattered ornament. There is a mild risk of over-saturation—nearly every sentence reaches for an image—which may slightly blur a few moments that could benefit from plainer contrast, but overall momentum and clarity are maintained. No significant loops, scaffold sentences, or syntactic monotony appear.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, densely informative, and usually do double or triple duty in image, tone, and character. Metaphors (“structure grew from the hill like frozen rain,” “attention is a candle in windy places”) are vivid and mostly clean; there is little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony. The rhythm supports the accumulative, contemplative mode while still moving the story forward. A slight deduction comes from the sheer saturation of figurative language, which occasionally edges toward ornamental rather than strictly necessary under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is dense and musical, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and images like “attic thunder and old glue” or “a map of paused wings” feeling precise rather than generic. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and pattern-driven, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding lines. Momentum is maintained despite lyricism; the story never stalls in decorative description. A few touches (“frogs kept a lighthouse”) flirt with ornamental whimsy, slightly diluting pressure in the home stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, images are fresh (“glowed in moonlight like water sliced thin”), and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once). Figurative density is high but not so thick as to muddy clarity; metaphors are coherent within the world’s logic. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; progression is continuous and propulsive for a lyric piece. A few abstractions (“time was already teaching us”) skim toward generality, but they’re anchored quickly back in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, often doing double duty for image and thought, with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but precise—“planetary aurora poured into cheap tempered glass,” “chain of exits becoming entries”—and rarely feels mixed or overextended. Information flow remains clear despite the lyricism; cause-and-effect and temporal shifts are easy to track, and the final cadence lands cleanly. There are a handful of slightly expository abstractions that could be rendered more concretely, but they don’t materially blunt momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are precise (“green as a harbor light, worn thin by years of being almost broken”) and most lines carry multiple layers of work (setting, character, theme). Figurative language is frequent but controlled by a consistent maritime lexicon, avoiding mixed metaphors or rhythm-deadening loops. There are a few near-aphoristic lines that momentarily feel summary-like, yet they’re brief and do not obscure action or closure. Pacing remains taut for a lyric piece; no paragraphs read as removable scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, but the metaphors are controlled and coherent, and most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and character at once). There is some risk of overload—nearly every line carries an image or conceit—which may slightly blur individual beats for a reader attuned to sharper contrast, but the pattern is taught early and sustained. Scaffold and repetition are minimal; lines seldom paraphrase each other, and information keeps accruing. Minor trimming could sharpen a few lines, yet nothing significantly obscures causality or muddies the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is high: images are original (“a jar of beetles and a scrap of paper”), sentences carry multiple jobs, and rhythm varies well across the piece. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled; metaphors about light, magnetism, and cloth form a coherent system rather than a random spray. There is mild risk of saturation—almost every sentence is metaphorically textured—which could be dialed back slightly for contrast, but clarity and momentum remain intact. No obvious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony interfere with the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is highly crafted: metaphors are fresh and largely coherent (“rusted to the sharpness of sugar,” “milk blue breath,” “a sorrow line like a river on a map”) and most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line adds a new facet of mood, world, or emotional state, sustaining momentum despite the reflective tone. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught from the opening and remains legible at closure, with no mixed-metaphor muddle in the peak beats around the root and tags. Syntax varies, punctuation is clean, and the final lines land with clarity and compressed force.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is precise and dense; most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffold or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and thematically unified (textiles, binding, fruit, breath), avoiding mixed metaphors or muddle. The rhythm on the page reads intentional, with varied sentence openings and paragraphing that follows conceptual shifts in the ritual. A small deduction because the persistent high density of metaphor and near-zero plain scaffolding could leave some readers wishing for an occasional simpler line to sharpen contrast, but clarity at closure remains excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are controlled, varied, and information-dense, with nearly every line doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, rarely slipping into mixed metaphors or obscuring sense. There is mild risk of saturation—almost every sentence reaches for an image—which a demanding editor might trim for air, but momentum and clarity remain intact. No noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony undercut the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but controlled; nearly every sentence does multiple jobs (image, theme, character) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is fresh and coherent (bread as devotional/history, tea leaves as fists, the tea house cloaking itself “in moss and etiquette”) and rarely feels strained. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, sinuous sentences and shorter, declarative ones, giving the piece momentum despite its reflective mode. I see no significant line-level artifacts or clarity issues, and the closure image lands cleanly and memorably.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level work is sophisticated: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and images that usually carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) at once. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent, with only a few moments flirting with over-saturation (“numbers that rang like bells left inside melting glaciers” plus adjacent metaphors). Syntax varies enough to keep the prose from becoming monotonous, and crucial beats are delivered clearly despite the lyricism. Trimming one or two of the more ornate metaphors in high-pressure moments would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is vivid and efficient: most sentences carry two or three jobs (world, mood, and micro-turn), and there’s little to no scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but rarely feels excessive or mixed; images stay within a coherent nautical/market/sound palette. Syntax varies and supports momentum, especially around the central spill and inhale. If anything, a single metaphor or two could be pared back for maximum sharpness, but the density never seriously muddies causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is elegant and information-dense: most sentences do multiple jobs of worldbuilding, characterizing, and thematizing at once (“She climbed the path as if gravity were reciting her biography”). Rhythm and syntax vary, and there’s very little scaffolding or repetition; the piece reads cleanly and aloud-pleasing. The extended metaphoric texture is mostly coherent and earned, with few if any mixed images that break sense. At times the unrelenting figuration edges toward overrichness, slightly blurring impact and keeping it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (image, mood, character, or forward motion) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but controlled; metaphors are internally consistent and rarely feel strained, and the prose avoids therapy-speak or abstract labels. Momentum is well-managed for a lyric piece—the sentences accrue pressure toward the lock and box beats without stalling in description. The final paragraphs in particular show excellent compression, tying sensory detail to thematic payoff without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush, information-dense, and rhythmically controlled, with many lines doing double duty in worldbuilding and emotional shading (e.g., “mercy here was always thirsty for consent”). Metaphors are inventive yet mostly coherent with the world’s logic (lungs, leaves, condensate, maps, jars) and don’t blur causality. There is mild risk of over-saturation—nearly every sentence is figurative—but momentum holds and pivotal beats remain clear. I see no notable loops or scaffolding; trimming a handful of metaphors could make the strongest ones land even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is lush and controlled; most sentences do multiple jobs of worldbuilding, mood, and character. Figurative language is dense (“foxes…their eyes two commas pausing in the sentence of snow”), but it rarely muddies sense or repeats itself mechanically. A few metaphors border on excess, and the near-constant lyricism occasionally risks softening narrative momentum, but clarity at the climax and ending remains intact. There are no noticeable scaffolds, redundancies, or grammatical distractions.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is remarkably strong: images are original, rhythm is varied, and most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious padding. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and controlled; metaphors extend a clear mechanical-organic vocabulary instead of clashing. There is some risk of overload—nearly every sentence is metaphoric—which slightly blurs a few beats of urgency. Still, clarity and momentum survive the lyric density, and the closing images read clean and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level work is highly crafted: sentences are varied in length and structure, imagery is fresh and internally coherent (“each rib a rumor, each breath witness”), and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative density is high but purposeful, supporting the accumulative texture rather than obscuring action. Crucial beats, especially the unlocking, remain clear despite the lyricism, and no metaphors feel mixed or mechanically generated. The prose sustains momentum without resorting to exposition dumps or filler.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is lush and information-dense; most sentences do double duty, advancing world, mood, and implicit stakes without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and thematically unified (tide, web, knots, lungs), so it reads as a coherent aesthetic rather than purple excess. Syntax varies enough to keep momentum, and the final lines (“a knot deciding it had been a bow all along,” strands humming with traffic) land with clarity and charge. A reader highly averse to sustained metaphor might feel the density as slightly heavy, but it does not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) and the rhythm varies in a controlled way that suits the lyric mode. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and non-redundant; images of gravity, salt, and light interlock rather than clashing. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic templates that sap momentum, and the closure image lands cleanly. The only slight reservation is that in a few places the saturation of metaphor edges toward overrichness, which might slightly tire rather than sharpen, but it does not obscure causality or the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: dense but mostly precise imagery, minimal redundancy, and sentences that routinely do double duty for atmosphere and narrative motion. The metaphoric layering around sound, water, and code remains coherent; I see no mixed metaphors that impair clarity, and momentum rarely stalls despite high figurative density. A few phrases (“terrestrially cosmic” twice, “tranquil blaze”) edge toward self-consciousness but are thematically consistent rather than ornamental fluff. There are no noticeable syntactic templates or loops, and the closing cadence is clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is lush yet surprisingly lean: most sentences do double duty for image and theme, and there is little true scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are largely coherent and motif-consistent (breath/weather/architecture), avoiding mixed or showy vehicles that would blur sense. Rhythm varies well, with long sinuous lines balanced by shorter, weightier beats around key turns (“Are you dead, I said…”). The only slight reservation is that the density of figurative language leaves minimal room for contrast, but it does not impede clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is very strong: almost every sentence carries multiple loads (image, emotion, and concept) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful; images like “a bruise of cobalt being peeled back by the appearing day” and “a library of frost where each pane contained the instructions for thaw” are precise and legible. There is some risk of saturation—nearly every line is metaphorically charged—which edges toward excess in places but never quite tips into muddle. Syntax remains clear and propulsive, supporting rather than fighting the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (world, theme, emotion), and there is little to no scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are generally coherent and grounded in the story’s lexicon (ink, law, breath, stone, light). However, figurative language is present in nearly every line, creating occasional purple density and leaving minimal room for plainer contrast that might sharpen key beats. This lush uniformity slightly blunts momentum and prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled: most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action), and the imagery is coherent within a water/stone/rope lexicon. Rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping or scaffold language. A few lines flirt with overload (“silence full of teeth,” “a web hums where I believed there was empty sky”), but clarity remains intact and the closure image is sharp and legible. Line-level craft is well above typical submission quality, only shy of perfect due to slight metaphor saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful metaphor, and minimal redundancy, with each line typically advancing both atmosphere and narrative. The figurative language is frequent but controlled; images of ice, breath, metal, and rhythm interlock rather than compete. A few phrases verge on lushness, but they don’t obscure action or stakes, and the final paragraph’s simplicity lands cleanly. Grammar, pacing, and transitions are smooth, with no discernible scaffold or template artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence does multiple jobs (image, mood, theme) with minimal redundancy, and the rhythm varies well. The figurative density is very high but rarely feels muddled—the metaphors are surprisingly controlled given their frequency. There are no obvious scaffold sentences, loops, or syntactic tics that dull momentum, and the closure image is crisp. The only restraint is that the lushness is constant enough that some readers may feel a slight saturation, keeping it a notch below absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished: sentences are varied, metaphor is mostly sharp and coherent, and nearly every line does double duty with atmosphere and idea (“absence is a kind of presence, and slicings are invitations to patient hands”). There’s no noticeable scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic monotony, and the read-aloud rhythm is strong. Figurative density is high but controlled; it almost, but never quite, tips into purple. Line-level craft clearly meets elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-by-line, the prose is richly imagistic yet impressively clean: few, if any, paraphrase loops; strong verbs and specific nouns; and metaphors that mostly cohere (“ledger and a portable flag of silence,” “miracles are embarrassing when they wear work boots”). The density of figurative language is high but pattern-consistent and supports the accumulative design. Syntax varies enough to maintain momentum and musicality. Occasionally an image feels more decorative than functional, but it doesn’t materially obscure causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and purposeful, often doing multiple jobs at once. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; images like “rust trying to remember being water” or “a note so clear it described the absence that made it necessary” are both precise and coherent. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and rhythm on the page carries momentum despite the lyric mode. The only small reservation is that the unrelenting lushness risks saturating some readers, but it does not impair clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, varied syntax, and figurative language that generally carries multiple loads of atmosphere, character, and theme (“sound poured out, not loud but thorough, like a tide washing a mind”). There are few, if any, true loops or scaffolding sentences; almost every line earns its place. The prose occasionally edges toward saturation in metaphor, risking a slight sense of over-ornamentation, but clarity and momentum remain intact and the closure image is clean. Tighter restraint in one or two places could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is highly controlled: most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, theme, and character) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent yet remarkably consistent in texture and logic; metaphors cluster around geology, weather, and magnetism, sustaining a unified aesthetic rather than purple noise. Momentum holds despite lyric density, as each paragraph adds a new pressure or facet rather than circling. There are virtually no syntactic artifacts or loops, and the closing lines land with clarity and weight.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, with most doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and character) without feeling overstuffed. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and well-chosen, rarely lapsing into purple or mixed metaphors; images like “white teeth of thirst” and “a quorum of caution that turned into a quorum of stillness” are both clear and striking. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and information moves forward without clog. A few slightly abstract formulations (“controlling influence,” “metrics”) skim the lyric edge but don’t materially slow momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often perform multiple tasks (image, theme, character) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and controlled (“a thorn of bent metal that snagged each gear like a doubt” is emblematic). There is some risk of over-lyricism at a sustained pitch, but it rarely muddies clarity or pace, and the final beats land cleanly. No noticeable syntactic templates or copy errors drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences often do double duty (world + character + theme), and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is dense but usually sharp and non-redundant, with few strained metaphors; rhythm shifts appropriately between playful, technical, and reverent beats. Information flows cleanly, and the closure image (acid wind confetti, laughing workshop, humming algorithm) is vivid rather than blurred by overwriting. A slightly lower metaphor density at a few points might sharpen impact further, but current execution remains well above typical submission quality.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, varied yet controlled metaphors, and almost no scaffolding or repetition. Sentences generally do double duty—advancing plot while deepening atmosphere or theme—and the rhythm reads well aloud. Figurative language is frequent but purposeful and coherent; images like “the silence was shaped like a missing person sitting beside me” are striking without feeling overwrought. A few lines edge toward decorative (“smelled faintly of dust and unsung birthdays”), but they remain clear and support tone rather than obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (world-building, theme, character), and there is minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors are fresh and coherent with the world (light, ice, fruit, mirrors), and rhythm supports mood shifts, especially around the gathering and the floe’s “page turning.” There is mild risk of over-saturation—so many images per paragraph that some could be pared for even greater punch—but clarity never breaks, and the closure image remains sharp. No noticeable mechanical errors or cadence templates undercut the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (image, emotion, theme) with minimal scaffolding, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony despite a high density of figurative language. Metaphors are coherent and local — ice, rope, wind, gulls — forming a tight imagistic field rather than a jumble. There are no evident synonym loops or explanatory paraphrases; the prose remains clear even in its most lyrical moments. The closing paragraphs, especially “The wind braided our silence into patience, and patience into a way home,” crystallize prior motifs without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly crafted, with strong images (“apple skins,” “moths that forgot the moon,” “ash scribbles still worried the stone”) doing multiple jobs at once—setting, mood, and theme. Despite density of figurative language, metaphors are coherent and non-redundant; they accumulate rather than blur. Sentence rhythm varies well, and there are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic templates dragging momentum. At times the lushness approaches the threshold of purple, but clarity and emotional propulsion remain intact, including at the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is richly imagistic yet generally precise, with high information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and thematic work simultaneously (e.g., “echo of wisdom, not the blare of it”). Metaphoric language is inventive and coherent within the story’s logic, and there is little to no scaffold, redundancy, or syntactic templating; the read-aloud rhythm is strong. A few lines flirt with overload (“gliding along the glimmer that lives at the side of sight”), which may briefly tax clarity, but not enough to dull closure or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush, rhythmic, and image-dense, with many lines doing double duty for setting, mood, and theme; there’s little dead scaffolding. Metaphors are mostly fresh and internally consistent, and repetitions like “as vines climb…” feel patterned rather than accidental. At times the language edges toward over-richness—almost every sentence carries a metaphor or extended image—which slightly risks diffusion of impact and may be a touch heavy for some elite venues. Still, clarity and momentum are maintained throughout, and both opening and final images are strong and well-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally do multiple jobs at once (image, theme, character). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, with memorable lines like “They are the places where pages fought back, and where knowledge won politely.” There is some risk of saturation—nearly every sentence is metaphorically charged—yet it rarely tips into muddle or redundancy. Momentum holds despite the lyricism, and the final image lands cleanly without being obscured by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is very strong: high information density, few if any redundant scaffolds, and images that often do double or triple duty for atmosphere, theme, and character. Figurative language is frequent but not muddled; metaphors (e.g., “laughter wearing a limp,” “chalk dust turned to milk on metal”) stay internally consistent and vivid. There are minor risks of saturation—nearly every sentence carries an image—but rhythm and clarity remain intact through the close. The final lines in particular are clean, precise, and resonant without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, character, theme) with few redundancies, and the read-aloud rhythm is strong. Metaphors are frequent yet largely controlled and thematically unified around listening, light, and bodily/instrumental analogies, avoiding mixed or incoherent images. There is minor risk of purple prose due to near-constant figurative density, but clarity of action and causality remains intact, especially in the central repair sequence. No significant scaffolding, loops, or mechanical artifacts undercut the closure image or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is densely imagistic yet controlled; nearly every line does double duty for character, setting, and theme without sliding into purple excess. Metaphors are coherent and motif-linked (curtains, rivers, shards, clouds), and there are no noticeable loops, scaffolding sentences, or template cadences. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, with shorter, plainer constructions as death approaches sharpening the emotional impact. The final lines, especially “the room holds the last note like a vow,” crystallize prior motifs with clean, memorable language.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, densely imagistic, and nearly every line does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and motion). Repetition (“closing loops,” noon, spoons) reads patterned rather than accidental and feeds the ritual texture. The main limitation is sheer density—figurative language is present in most sentences, occasionally edging toward overload and slightly blurring peaks from background. Still, clarity holds at closure, and there are no serious scaffolding or syntactic artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level work is exceptionally controlled: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (world, character, theme) without redundancy or clutter. Figurative language is dense but coherent and pattern-taught (bones ↔ stars ↔ maps ↔ constellations) so it reads as integrated texture rather than purple overlay. Rhythm varies; long, sinuous lines give way to clean declaratives at key turns (“He had hidden while the town argued with the river, and now the argument had climbed into his bones”). There are no noticeable scaffolds, synonym loops, or mixed metaphors to dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (image, emotion, worldbuilding) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. The figurative density is high, but images are generally clean and non-contradictory, and cadence varies enough to avoid algorithmic monotony. A few lines verge on lush (“each one a rounded thought,” “stringed ovals peopled by dusk and mist”), yet they still carry concrete sense and do not blur causality or closure. Grammar and sequencing are clear, and the final image is sharp and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is highly crafted: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, emotion, and theme. Metaphors are generally fresh and coherent (e.g., “a fossil of sunlight and trapped wings”), and repetition tends to be purposeful rather than looped. There is a sustained figurative richness—especially in the opening—that flirts with over-density but maintains clarity and momentum due to tight focus and consistent imagery. I see no significant scaffolding, syntactic monotony, or figurative muddle that touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense but purposeful: most sentences carry multiple loads (image, theme, character) without obvious redundancy or scaffold. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and pattern-consistent (“river,” “pages,” “shell,” “mist”), avoiding mixed metaphors or semantic confusion. There are almost no paraphrase loops or filler constructions, and the read-aloud rhythm varies naturally. The only arguable weakness is that the sustained lyric intensity risks slight saturation; a sharper contrast or one plainer beat might increase impact by relief.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is lush yet mostly disciplined: metaphors are vivid, specific, and rarely mixed, and many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and thematic charge. Figurative density is high but pattern-consistent, so it reads as an intentional lyric mode instead of purple drift. There are virtually no scaffolding or paraphrase loops; each line tends to introduce a new facet of the ritual or the emotional texture. The only restraint keeping this from the very top is that the unrelentingly ornate register may slightly dilute impact in peak moments where a sharper, plainer line could cut more deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and action) with very little scaffold or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors tend to cohere around bodies, breath, and tools rather than scattering into mixed or strained comparisons. Momentum holds despite lyric density because each sentence tangibly advances the ritual or the journey. A slight risk of overload in image-rich lines keeps it just short of utterly seamless, but clarity and propulsion never truly falter.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, well-shaped, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (e.g., “locks were never only doors; they were agreements between patience and pressure”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, with only occasional risks of saturation; crucial beats (the first successful echo harvest, the final cellar stacking) remain clear and un-muddied. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and rhythm carries the accumulative structure smoothly. A slight reduction or more varied pacing of metaphor clusters in the midsection would push the prose into the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong, with many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding and emotion, e.g., “echoes clicked as if coins discussing the afterlife of pockets”). Rhythm varies effectively, and there’s little overt scaffolding or redundancy. The main limitation is sheer figurative density—nearly every line carries a simile or metaphor—which occasionally risks blur and reader fatigue even if it rarely collapses into true muddle. Despite that richness, causality and closure images remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (image, character, theme) with minimal redundancy, and the read-aloud rhythm varies effectively. Metaphors are original and mostly well-matched to circus/woodworking domains, avoiding mixed vehicles and cliché; figurative density is high but feels pattern-taught rather than purple. There are no significant scaffolding sentences, loops, or clarity issues, and the final paragraph lands with precise, charged images. I’m holding just under 9+ because the figurative richness is almost continuous; a bit more sparseness at one or two peaks could sharpen contrast even further.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, rich in information, and most metaphors are both fresh and legible (“ticket-taker’s confession, that he punched holes the size of exits”). Repetition (“By collecting fragments of overheard stories…”) is purposeful, adding structural and thematic cohesion rather than looping. The prose does ride the edge of over-saturation with figurative language, but the pattern is controlled and supports momentum and closure instead of obscuring them. There are no noticeable syntactic or clarity errors that touch the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and metaphors that are fresh yet coherent (“windows mirrored dusk like paused galaxies,” “sinks spoke mathematics”). The prose balances lyricism with clarity of physical action—rerouting flows, flipping breakers, reversing an escalator all remain legible. There is a slight risk of uniform figurative richness throughout, which can flatten dynamics if not varied more aggressively at peak beats. Nonetheless, no serious artifacts or redundancies blunt momentum or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, theme) and the rhythm varies enough to keep a long lyric paragraph from feeling monotonous. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and purposeful, rarely slipping into mixed or confusing metaphor. There is minor over-ornamentation—phrases like “pavements jeweled with patient droplets” or “ledger of afternoons” stack on top of already-charged imagery and could be pared without loss. The prose remains clear and propulsive for this meditative mode, but the lushness slightly risks saturation, hence the sub-9 score.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and images that typically do more than one job (e.g., “a grating complaint rose through the water like a story finally asked to speak”). The prose flirts with purple at times—metaphor density is high across the whole piece—but the vehicles rarely muddle sense or contradict each other. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony; rhythm varies well. A slight trim of the most ornate lines could push this into absolutely top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rich in layered imagery, and usually do multiple jobs (world-building, theme, and character at once). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and patterned—lightning as memory, rope as scripture, ocean as midwife—rarely tipping into muddle or redundancy. Momentum holds despite the lyricism; each paragraph adds a new facet rather than rephrasing the last. At times the density of metaphors edges toward excess, slightly softening sharpness of individual images, but clarity and closure remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is lush, original, and largely free of redundancy; most sentences do double duty in imagery and emotional motion. Metaphors (“a harbor learns to listen,” “leaves like small coins spending their shine”) are vivid yet internally coherent, with only a few bordering on saturation but not to the point of opacity. Rhythm varies well, with longer lyric runs balanced by plainer, anchoring statements like “We sit on the stone lip of the fountain.” The only small drag is that density is so consistently high that a touch more spareness at peak beats might sharpen impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is very strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (world-building, mood, character, or theme) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and pattern-consistent (gears, chains, wings, lullabies, light-as-feathers), avoiding mixed metaphors or semantic muddle. Syntax varies enough to keep momentum, and the prose reads cleanly with no significant grammatical or referential slips. The main caution is that in a few spots the pile-up of modifiers borders on purple, but it never materially obscures cause/effect or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (image, character, theme) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise—obsidian as “black as a pupil,” scars that “crackle whenever she hears matches”—and doesn’t tangle itself. Syntax and paragraphing create a smooth, propulsive cadence appropriate to a lyric narrative with subtle internal stakes. A very few lines verge on explanatory (“That is the sound of healed edges…”) but they don’t significantly blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are lean yet evocative, and most lines do multiple jobs (world, theme, action) without padding. Repetition motifs (“defiant hush,” “breadcrumbs,” “sidereal patience”) feel patterned rather than looped, and there are no significant clarity issues. A few phrases verge on purple or abstract (“trusted the arithmetic of absence”), but they remain legible and voice-consistent. The final lines land cleanly, reactivating earlier motifs without explanatory drag.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, often doing thematic and imagistic work simultaneously (“softness can be structure and not surrender”). Figurative language is mostly coherent with the story’s physics and motifs; there are few, if any, outright muddled metaphors. However, nearly every line carries a metaphor or abstraction, which occasionally flattens impact by offering no plainer counter-texture or rest. A light pruning of the richest stretches could increase propulsion and sharpen the already compelling images.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but remarkably clean: metaphors are fresh and coherent, rarely stacking to the point of blur, and almost every sentence does double duty in image and character. Rhythm varies well—long, sinuous lines about environment and craft are punctuated by shorter, declarative insights at key beats (“Grief migrates as well, I thought…”). There are no noticeable paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences; information and feeling move forward continuously. The closure image is sharp and un-muddied, with prior motifs (kite, migration, restraint) distilled into that “single spare curve.”

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is consistently strong: high information density, vivid metaphors, and rhythmic variety that suits the reverie mode without collapsing into sludge. Recurrent images (rake handle, notches, tide, silence) do double duty for setting, theme, and character, with minimal scaffolding or synonym loops. The prose flirts with over-saturation of figurative language, but patterns are taught early and remain legible, and syntax stays clear even in peak beats. There are no artifacts that blur causality or dull the closure image; every late sentence feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally multi-functional, advancing atmosphere, character, and plot at once. Figurative language is frequent but mostly well-chosen and legible; the imagery stack rarely muddies sense or momentum. There is mild risk of over-lushness in places, yet clarity and propulsion to the discoveries and final decision remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is highly polished: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (world-building, theme, character) without obvious redundancy. The figurative language is frequent but seldom indulgent; images like “Snow scratched the windows like a quill testing paper for flaws” are precise and apt for the narrator’s vocation. Syntax is varied and transitions are smooth, with no meaningful loops or scaffolding artifacts. A few lines lean close to aphorism, but they’re supported enough by concrete context to avoid feeling like free-floating quotes.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is highly crafted, with strong information density—most lines carry setting, mood, and character simultaneously (e.g., “I scattered ash over the page and blew; letters clung like shy seeds”). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and patterned, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. At times the metaphor density edges toward luxuriant, but it doesn’t materially blur causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, varied syntax, and vivid yet largely coherent imagery that does more than one job per sentence. Recurring metaphors of dust, ash, and fracture are controlled enough not to blur meaning, and there is minimal redundancy. A few lines verge on abstraction (“a hallway of echoes”), but they’re anchored by concrete objects immediately before and after, so momentum never stalls. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final paragraphs land with clarity and sonic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly crafted, with strong information density and multi-tasking lines that carry worldbuilding, characterization, and theme simultaneously. Metaphors are frequent but mostly precise and non-contradictory, and momentum is maintained despite lyric richness. There’s minimal scaffold or paraphrase looping; nearly every sentence earns its keep. The only reservation at a top-tier standard is the sheer density of figurative language, which occasionally nudges toward overrich rather than sharpening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences perform multiple functions (character, atmosphere, and theme) without padding, and figurative language is both coherent and aligned with the sensory world of music and libraries. Repetition of key phrases (“subtracting noise,” “traveled stillness”) reads as motif rather than loop, and there is little to no scaffolding or synonym churn. The prose is lush but controlled; metaphors stay within the established palette and rarely feel strained. Any minor over-richness does not impede clarity or the impact of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, theme) with minimal redundancy, and images are fresh and coherent. The prose sustains a dense metaphorical texture (“water measured in breaths,” “shadows curved like commas”) that mostly remains precise and legible. There is mild risk of over-lyric saturation, but it doesn’t blur causality or the closing image. I see no significant loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle that would dull momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, densely informative, and typically do double or triple duty for character, world, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and pattern-coherent, building the honey/bee/lightning lexicon rather than drifting into mush. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic glitches, and the closure lines land cleanly. A few metaphors (“screens brightened like petals”) are more decorative than pressurized, keeping this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is very high: most sentences perform multiple jobs (setting, character, theme) without obvious redundancy, and the imagery is strikingly original yet legible. Metaphors are frequent but rarely feel mixed or incoherent; the few slightly ornate phrases (“a hushed blaze,” “needle’s amber eye”) still track. There’s minimal scaffolding or looped paraphrase, so momentum is preserved despite the lyric mode. The only limit at this band is that the consistently heightened register risks, in places, feeling a touch uniform emotionally, without sharper textural contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is elegant and information-dense; nearly every sentence advances image, world-building, and theme simultaneously (“Silt rose like breath from stone lungs, animate lifeless and oddly tender.”). Figurative language is abundant but largely coherent and controlled, building a consistent aquatic-statue lexicon rather than wandering into mixed metaphors. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and key beats (touching the ampoule, threading, breaking it) are rendered cleanly without syntactic confusion. The only slight limitation is that the uniform lushness can blunt sharpness in a couple of high-pressure moments, but it never obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is dense, efficient, and largely free of scaffolding; nearly every sentence advances image, concept, or emotional charge. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (regret as engine, lemmas as steps, longing curving space). There’s minimal redundancy and no serious clarity breaks, even at the abstract end. The only check is that the sustained metaphorical density risks slight saturation for some readers, keeping this just short of absolute top-band craft.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty for image and theme, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent, with motifs of light, language, and remembrance interlocking rather than competing. The cadence of long, image-rich lines broken by shorter declaratives (“Not a miracle, she insisted…”) maintains momentum in a contemplative piece. A slight tendency toward ornate phrasing prevents this from feeling utterly effortless, but it remains well within elite quality.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character) without evident redundancy or scaffold. Figurative language is inventive yet coherent—bees, wax, bread, and water recur in a tight image system that never muddies action or stakes. Rhythm varies between longer, luxuriant lines and clipped pivots (“Responsibility settled on me like nectar armor, sweet and unbearable, and I accepted.”), preserving momentum. I see no meaningful loops, syntax glitches, or overwrought tangles that would dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, varied sentence rhythm, and images that usually do more than one job (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). Metaphors like “light…remembering itself” and “a sound like a drowning prayer” are striking and apt, and the prose maintains momentum despite being lush. There is some risk of figurative overload and a few near-purple constructions, but they do not materially obscure causality or the closure image. No obvious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony undercut the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is dense and inventive; nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, world-building) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Rhythm varies nicely between longer baroque constructions and shorter, cutting lines, keeping momentum even in a heavily metaphorical mode. The main risk is slight overload: the sheer frequency of figurative language means a few images blur rather than sharpen, though they don’t significantly obscure causality or closure. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final lines land with crisp clarity despite the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is rich and controlled, with high information density: metaphors typically do double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“foam teaching itself new borders,” “weather learning to be orchestra”). Rhythm varies well; there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and each sentence tends to add a new facet or motion. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent; moments like “a floating net of knives” or “a D grown from pressure and distance” are vivid rather than muddled. The only constraint on a higher score is that the sheer rate of metaphor occasionally risks saturation, asking the reader to work harder than necessary during peak-action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: high information density, varied yet coherent syntax, and metaphor that almost always clarifies rather than muddies (“sunflowers that prefer the shadow,” “a sound like sand poured over bone”). Repetition is pattern-driven, not accidental, and supports the accumulative texture. There are no evident scaffold sentences, paraphrase loops, or figurative tangles that blunt key beats. Rhythm tightens appropriately toward closure, and the final line recharges prior images without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are fresh, lines are information-dense, and most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, character, and theme at once). Metaphors generally cohere (ivy, throats, pits, engines, ledgers) and reinforce a unified texture rather than clashing. There is a high density of figurative language, but it’s pattern-consistent and seldom obscures meaning or momentum. A few abstractions and parallel formulations (“I am here to…,” “I recapture…”) verge on rhetorical, yet they don’t create loops or real drag.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is lush but mostly controlled: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (setting, character, theme) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and tonally aligned; metaphors like “letters never sent” and “bridge’s raised spine as a timeline” deepen sense rather than blur it. Rhythm varies well across longer, sinuous lines and shorter emphatic beats (“I did not come merely to measure.”), supporting momentum. The density flirts with overwriting in places but does not materially obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences are syntactically clean, information-dense, and often do double duty for atmosphere and thought, e.g., “Imports of pumps, of anchors, of the weight that drags a thing into the grave while calling it saved.” Figurative language is vivid and largely coherent with the world’s physical and thematic logic (lungs, tides, silt, ink), with very few mixed metaphors. There is some risk of over-saturation—nearly every line carries an image—which slightly blunts momentum and contrast in high-pressure beats. Nonetheless, clarity is never lost, and the final lines land with a sharpened, not blurred, image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion, or action plus theme) and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Imagery is rich but controlled; metaphors (“catches sky like a spoon catches sugar,” “each facet coaxed from stone like a confession”) are apt and internally consistent with the story’s material palette. Rhythm on the line level supports the accumulative, ceremonial feel without bogging momentum. If anything, the density skirts the edge of overrichness, but clarity and closure remain fully intact.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is lush, idiosyncratic, and information-dense; images often do double duty for setting and psychology (e.g., breakers like “ice forming inside an iron ribcage,” villages “knitting absence”). Sentences vary in length and rhythm, producing a strong read-aloud cadence that supports the lyric mode and the accumulating pressure. The figurative load is heavy—nearly every line carries a metaphor—which occasionally edges toward saturation but rarely muddles sense or obscures causality. There are no noticeable loops, scaffold sentences, or syntactic artifacts; a bit more sparseness around peak-turn lines might increase impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly crafted, with high information density—most sentences do at least two jobs of image, theme, and motion—and the rhythm on the page is varied and controlled. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled; images like “letters and orbits…relatives who stopped using last names” and “tucks it under their tongue as if storing thunder” are fresh and legible. There is mild risk of saturation, where nearly every line reaches for metaphor, which may tire some readers and slightly softens the punch of peak moments. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained and there are no obvious loops, scaffolds, or syntactic artifacts dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (image, theme, character) and there is minimal scaffolding or repetition. The figuration is unusually consistent and apt, building a unified metaphor field around archives, tide, and carving; rhythm on the page reads well aloud. There is some density of metaphor (“a sieved hush sifted…,” “tide leaves minutes…”) that might be fractionally pared for maximal impact in a top-tier venue, but it does not obscure action or closure. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final line succinctly recharges the watch/time motif without ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and dense, with many sentences doing multiple jobs of image, world, and emotion. Recurrent phrases like “furrowed hush” and coin imagery create a coherent texture rather than feeling repetitive, and there is little to no scaffolding or redundancy. A few metaphors risk slight over-richness (“coins of our breath,” “bruise into a bridle on tomorrow”), but they do not obscure sense or slow momentum. Line-level control clearly supports the scene’s pacing and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, theme) and maintain momentum, and metaphors are generally coherent and apt to the maritime mind. There’s a high density of figurative language, but it’s patterned and controlled rather than random purple prose, and clarity of action is never lost. A few lines push toward richness saturation (“sea hammering the pilings like a judge with a softened gavel,” “gulls sang like somebody practicing forgiveness off-key”) yet still track and support tone. No evident scaffolding, loops, or syntactic monotony mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is highly controlled: almost every sentence does double duty in advancing atmosphere, concept, and character, with minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and purposeful, building a consistent aesthetic rather than lapsing into purple or mixed metaphors. The piece maintains momentum despite its lyricism, with no obvious paraphrase loops or filler beats. Closing images (“stain me kindly,” “read the city differently, line by line”) elegantly reprise earlier motifs without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is lush yet generally precise; most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without collapsing into muddle. Recurring phrases like “paradoxically steady” and the spice lists feel intentional rather than redundant, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. A few metaphors verge on saturation, but they remain coherent and legible, and do not obscure the closure image or causal flow. There is little scaffolding or synonym churn; nearly every line advances atmosphere or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush but mostly precise; images like “time ran like milk down the clockface” and “seconds…like dust within a bell jar” do multiple jobs at once (theme, setting, emotion). Sentence rhythms vary and carry momentum, with very little scaffold or paraphrase looping; nearly every line adds a new facet. Figurative density is high but coherent—the crack, hands, clouds, and insects recur with clear internal logic rather than mixed metaphor. A few metaphors (“sentence left unbuttoned,” “waking world…like milk”) slightly flirt with over-stacking, but they don’t blur meaning or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and purposeful, with very little scaffolding or repetition, and images such as “a bead of compassion hardened into something that could weigh” do multiple jobs at once. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled, and rhythm supports the contemplative pressure rather than stalling it. The sheer density of metaphor borders on excess in places, keeping this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is dense yet precise: images like “bottled lightning bug collection like a lantern bouquet” and “the mountain sounded like a sleeping animal trying to learn a new breathing pattern” are vivid, coherent, and thematically resonant. Figurative language is frequent but patterned (breath, dance, water/light), so it reads as intentional motif rather than indiscriminate ornament. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding sentences, or syntactic templates that stall momentum, and action remains clear despite lyric compression. A few phrases (“vibrant hush,” “careful ballet”) verge on repetition of idea, which trims absolute top-tier sharpness but doesn’t materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density; most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, rarely slipping into mixed metaphor or clogging clarity. There are very few scaffolding or redundant sentences, and action sequencing remains legible despite the lyricism. The density of metaphor across nearly every line could be pared slightly in peak beats to sharpen impact, but it does not significantly drag momentum or obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: images are vivid, sentences carry multiple jobs at once, and the rhythm modulates well between incantatory description and beat-by-beat action during the ritual. Figurative density is high but generally coherent and controlled; metaphors extend a consistent logic of friction, pattern, and light rather than clashing. There’s virtually no scaffolding, redundancy, or template cadence, and the closure image (“read it like scripture, not to be saved, but to stay awake”) recharges earlier motifs. The only small reservation is that the unrelenting lushness might slightly tax some readers’ processing in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences do multiple jobs (image, theme, character) with few redundancies, and the overall rhythm reads well aloud. Figurative language is abundant but largely coherent and thematically aligned (lightning, scars, maps, exposure), with minimal mixed-metaphor muddle. There are no obvious scaffold sentences or synonym loops dragging momentum, and the final images (“healed page drying,” “map that breathed”) land cleanly. A very exacting editor might trim a handful of modifiers to avoid any hint of purple, but the prose remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is lush and high-density; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, theme, character) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Metaphors are generally apt and striking (“his smile was an invitation to accidents,” “we breathed like metronomes adopting jazz”), and the rhythm adapts well to shifts between contemplation and action. There is persistent figurative richness in nearly every line, which risks saturation but remains legible and purposeful. Trimming one or two slightly over-packed images would sharpen momentum further toward true top-tier minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is dense, original, and sonically tuned, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (“the stacks are ribs, and books breathe like sleeping beasts”). Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled; metaphors extend a coherent lexicon of copper, breath, ribs, and light rather than spinning off arbitrarily. There’s no significant synonym churn or scaffold, and rhythm varies enough to keep the piece from feeling metronomic. The only restraint is that the uniformly heightened diction risks slight saturation, offering few moments of plainness to sharpen the peaks even further.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, concrete, and information-dense, often doing double duty for image and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and non-redundant; there are few, if any, mixed metaphors or outright purple passages. Momentum rarely stalls despite the lyricism, and each paragraph advances either situation or emotional charge. The sheer density of metaphor in some stretches slightly risks saturation, keeping this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-by-line craft is remarkably controlled: nearly every sentence advances image, world logic, or emotional stance with little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but rarely muddled; metaphors are internally consistent with the story’s ecosystem (memory as reef, lies as rivers, rain as punctuation). Rhythm varies and builds toward the planting and monsoon beats, and the final sentences land cleanly without explanatory overrun. I see no significant loops, template cadences, or grammatical distractions that sap momentum or blur the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is very strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (world, emotion, theme) and the rhythm is varied and deliberate. Figurative density is high but generally coherent and patterned (“ocean’s tarnished lungs,” “patient pupils”), supporting the accumulative texture. A few phrases risk edging toward purple or repetition (multiple uses of “rhythmically placid”), but they’re motif-driven rather than sloppy. There’s no real scaffolding or synonym loops, and the closure image remains sharp and uncluttered.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and polished. The density of simile and metaphor linking nature to mathematics ("clouds like equations," "tasks like constellations," "arithmetic of survival") is high; while effective for the voice, it occasionally borders on being overwrought. The "kindled humility" line is slightly abstract, but overall control is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative but suffers from rhythmic monotony due to repeated syntactic templates ("thickened, then thinned," "nested... then rose, then braided," "failed, and vanished"). Additionally, occasional overwriting ("drought of soot," "dawn would sew itself") draws attention to the author's hand rather than the scene, slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("teeth like antlers," "ring like a pocket of stars"). The rhythm supports the contemplative mood. There is a slight tendency toward overwriting ("library stores breath"), but the line-level craft generally enhances the sensory experience of the silent world.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush, rhythmic, and highly textured, with strong sensory anchoring. However, the second explicit invocation of "inadvertently stubborn" feels slightly mechanical, functioning more as a prompt-check than organic interiority. A few phrases ("sealed in glass domes and regret") lean towards abstraction, but the overall craft is high-caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is lyrical and rhythmically controlled, with strong sensory density ("notes low but impossible to ignore") that elevates the montage sections. Occasional metaphor stacking threatens clarity but generally succeeds in creating a distinct, high-quality texture.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from extreme metaphorical density ("diluted ink," "heart of a cloud," "ribs of light," "attic lungs") that clogs momentum. While grammatically polished, the reliance on similes in nearly every sentence creates a "purple" texture that distracts from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.6)
    While individual images are striking, the prose suffers from significant overwriting and density issues ("ink sweating," "ribs and knots," "restrained bell" all in the opener). The unrelenting use of figurative language—nearly one metaphor or simile per sentence—violates the economy bias and impedes narrative momentum, triggering a heavy penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.7)
    High-quality diction and evocative imagery ("unwind like cocoons") are undermined by pervasive syntactic monotony, with nearly every sentence following a "She [verb]s" or "Mara [verb]s" structure. This "drumbeat rhythm" creates a template-like cadence that stalls the momentum of action beats. While the descriptions are lovely, the lack of syntactic variety makes the prose feel static.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and dense with imagery, though at times the figurative language stacks up ("kiln of sediment and light," "metronome carved from frostburn") in a way that slows propulsion. The line-level craft is high, but the density occasionally obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from high adjectival density and occasional "purple" phrasing ("hush of luminous disbelief"). Some prompt elements are inserted as direct "tells" (e.g., "The motivation was simple..."), which disrupts the otherwise smooth narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose creates a lush texture but suffers from overwrought metaphors that obscure clarity (e.g., "sound like paper being forgiven," "melt sand and snow science"). "Gout orange" reads as a usage error or a jarringly obscure image that distracts from the visual.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose density is high with strong, fresh imagery ("syllables like rope over wood"). However, the verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("firmly adaptive," "transformative betrayal") creates slight rhythmic stumbles, reading as labels rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.2)
    Metaphorical density is extremely high, slowing propulsion and obscuring clarity ("gilding flaking like tired moons," "breath a gull does not take," "rain's skipped heartbeats" in close proximity). The relentless figurative language in high-pressure beats distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and high-density, with evocative imagery throughout. However, a structural artifact is present: the frequent reliance on "like [noun]" similes ("like a breath," "like polish," "like broom bristles," "like warm metal," "like cords," "like bricks") creates a repetitive syntactic cadence that drags on momentum. Variation in metaphorical construction would elevate this to the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is high-effort and often evocative ("puddles murmuring like glass throats"), demonstrating strong image control. However, the density of metaphor sometimes borders on overwrought ("motivation hums simple as rain"), slightly obscuring the clarity of the action in service of poetic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("constellations of stubborn care"). Rhythm varies well to match the contemplative pace. A few metaphors border on density over clarity, but the line-level craft is largely excellent and propels the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and evocative, but suffers from a high density of similes ("like a wish," "like early snow," "like oil," "like winter flags") that creates a repetitive syntactic cadence. This stylistic artifact occasionally draws attention away from the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative ("mouth full of light," "varnish crazed into river deltas"), but the sentence structure in the first third relies heavily on repetitive "I [verb]" openers that create a slightly monotonous staccato. Additionally, the required phrase "Water damage creating images" is inserted as a compound subject in a way that feels syntactically clumsy ("Water damage creating images stains its pages").

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense with high-quality imagery ("echo answers like low surf under ice") and strong rhythmic control. The writing maintains high information density without loops, successfully balancing technical terminology with emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density and strong rhythm throughout; "droplets quivered like verdicts" is a standout image. A minor lexical cluster in the first stanza ("beaded... beads... beads") is the only slight friction in an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from high-density overwriting. Nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or simile ("peace settles like pollen," "pages that grow bark," "stalactites tick like metronomes"), creating a textural thickness that slows momentum and exhaust the ear. While beautiful, the lack of syntactic variance and plain "grounding" sentences triggers the density penalty, as the figurative language draws attention to itself over the action.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose flow is generally smooth but marred by mixed metaphors ("moon bit into the sun like a patient moth") and label-insertion. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("mellow music therapist," "softly adaptive") reduces density and feels like prompt-checking rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    A severe editorial oversight creates a paraphrase loop in the first third: lines 6 and 7 repeat the finding of "half-burned diaries in a fireplace" almost verbatim, breaking immersion and momentum. While individual images are striking ("dust flurries like moths"), the text suffers from "tell" heavy phrasing ("He is sensitively perceptive") and this glaring structural repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, dense, and rhythmically assured, with high information density and no scaffold loops. A few metaphors border on the precious ("fingerprint trying to fly"), but the overall craftsmanship is high and supports the magical realist tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but the density of figurative language is high ("eyes a longitude no map would claim," "ultramarine no ocean could afford"). While evocative, the relentless metaphor-stacking occasionally distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush, rhythmic, and highly controlled ("whale-slow groans," "pizzicato"), with excellent sonic texture. A few metaphors border on the surreal or mixed ("wings slice time into edible slivers" into "violin steam"), but the dense style largely supports the story's dream logic without breaking flow.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished but dense with metaphors ("covenant with the ground," "caustic starlight") that sometimes crowd the line-level logic. The required phrase "darkening brightness" appears twice, creating a repetitive artifact that feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but suffers from a high density of similes ("like a lighthouse," "like frost," "like moons," "like fish," "like winter birds," etc.) which creates a scaffold of comparison that occasionally distances the reader from immediate experience. While the imagery is beautiful, the reliance on "like/as" constructions becomes a textural artifact. Line-level momentum is otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from simile density that slows momentum, especially in the climax ("like heat," "like two needles," "like a metronome"). Rhetorical scaffolding is visible, such as the anadiplosis chain ("dot a memory, the memory a pressure") and the parallel list ("nurse in me... clerk in me"), which draw attention to the writing rather than the action.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is generally evocative, the final third suffers from distracting repetition artifacts. The word "patient" appears three times ("patient ink," "patient decay," "patient flame") and "disciplined" twice ("disciplined lightning," "disciplined bloom") in the resolution, creating an algorithmic cadence that undermines the emotional closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density ("rope... as grammar," "connection is a sentence," "voice modest as a match"), triggering the Overwriting penalty. The relentless figurative language obscures the physical action, particularly in the climax where the mirror and rope become confused abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is evocative and image-rich, with strong rhythms and high information density ("roots drinking brackish light"). A few phrases feel like inserted artifacts ("ears are acoustically perceptive" reads as a clinical label amidst poetry), and the metaphor density in the middle section borders on overwriting. Generally, the line-level craft supports the atmospheric intent well.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("light thinned into tea," "knifed from thick paper") with high information density and no scaffolding. The repetitive "I [verb]" cadence functions as a rhythmic choice that reinforces the dealer's methodical nature rather than reading as a flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from extreme metaphorical density ("tide-smile," "bookmarks winds," "dark seems alphabetized"), which obscures clarity and creates rhythm fatigue. High-frequency usage of "purple" descriptors blocks narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high adjective density ("shimmering crater," "dark panes," "void-sun") that slows momentum. Occasional mixed metaphors ("trembled with dawnlike hush") and abstract phrasing obscure the physical action in favor of poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, mirroring the "hush, rush" of the canals. Imagery is vivid ("curled around my wrists like steam," "silence that clocks fear"). The writing is polished with no noticeable artifacts or wasted motion.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and mixed metaphors ("skins catching the moonlight like equations wearing festival clothes"). The high density of similes in nearly every sentence creates a "purple" texture that obscures the narrative momentum and physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the general prose quality is high, the required phrase "while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage" is pasted verbatim twice, creating severe tense mismatches ("flicker" vs "breathed/pulsed") and repetitive clutter. The second insertion occurs during the climax, breaking the narrative momentum and damaging the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from simile density ("like second thoughts," "like a map," "like damp clothes," "like a sullen apprentice," "like a sapling"), which creates a scaffolding effect that distances the reader. The reliance on "like" constructions weakens the immediacy of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the sensory density is often effective, the prose suffers from significant artifacts, most notably using the distinct phrase "wryly earnest" for two different characters in a short space. The metaphorical load is heavy ("wind's teeth," "prayer tasted like rust"), occasionally obscuring clarity for the sake of lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive phrasing, particularly of required elements. Phrases like "overlapping shadows," "steadily unpredictable," and "unseen forces" are repeated verbatim, creating a loop effect that stalls momentum. The density of figurative language ("ribs ring," "rings braid") occasionally clutters the line-level clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically assured, with high information density and evocative imagery. However, the density of figurative language (e.g., "air deciding whether to commit," "rain turns from memory into mist") occasionally threatens to obscure the immediate physical action in the middle beats. The "ledger" motif effectively anchors the lyrical flights in concrete nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence structure suffers from significant monotony, with a high frequency of "I [verb]" openers creating a repetitive cadence. Repetition of words ("listening," "trembling certainty") and heavy reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("hesitant mercy," "expectant breath") clutter the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is overwritten, with a density of figurative language that obscures clarity ("question with chairs," "gulls like torn letters," "tiny salts"). The reliance on abstract metaphor in high-pressure beats ("table cleared of fear") violates the show-don't-tell principle and slows momentum significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from high aphoristic density and mixed metaphors ("geometry had the tone of rumors, the texture of intrigue"), which obscures clarity. The prompt phrase "hushed thunder" is repeated four times, becoming a distracted text loop rather than a tonal anchor. The metaphor of the "union strike" clashes tonally with the surrounding high-fantasy imagery, breaking the immersive spell.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic ("swallowing night as if it were law"), with high information density. A few metaphors border on abstract ("timeline of a small moon"), but the line-level craft is rigorous and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from metaphor density; nearly every sentence carries a simile or figurative image ("braided like sentences," "clenched fist," "sleeping fruit"). This relentless poetic texture occasionally slows momentum and draws attention to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail ("hospital light and gulls"). The score is held back slightly from the highest bands by a tendency toward heavy metaphor in the climax ("unbutton her throat," "mouth like iron"), which momentarily slows the pacing of the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is dense with evocative imagery ("gulls flurried up like unfinished thoughts"), though it occasionally drifts into preciousness that slows momentum. The phrase "cute cough" is a jarring register slip that disrupts the mythic tone. High density of metaphor sometimes obscures the literal action.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished with high density and good rhythm. The imagery is evocative ("tide that buys new paint"), though occasionally the metaphorical density threatens to slow momentum in the first half.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is polished, the climax suffers from significant metaphor congestion that slows the momentum of the high-pressure beat. Images like "wing like a shard," "throat of a friend," "thin as a vow," and "abdomen like a lantern" stack up too densely in a short space. The simile "flame licked up like a polite throat clearing" feels slightly twee for the gravity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.5)
    Significant repetition artifacts mar the opening ("heartfelt artisan" appears twice in two sentences). The prose suffers from simile overload, with "like a [noun]" constructions appearing nearly a dozen times, creating a repetitive syntactic cadence that drags on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from extreme metaphorical density, with nearly every sentence carrying a simile ("like teeth," "like a door," "like a clerk," "like a pet") or personification. This constant figurative layering creates a scaffolding effect that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is polished, with strong rhythmic control ("unwound metronome in his bones") and high information density. While some metaphors are slightly overwrought ("urgency played his ribs"), the sensory language is generally sharp and propulsive. There are minor repetitive sentence structures ("He paced... He set... He passed..."), but they fit the rhythmic intent of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Imagery is generally dense and effective ("silt swallows my lamp into a bruise"), but the verbatim repetition of "overriding instinct" in two separate beats disrupts the prose rhythm and reads as a visible prompt artifact. "Panic paddles my ribs" leans slightly into overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is crafted, the density of figurative language is excessive in high-pressure beats. The metaphorical thicket in the climax obscures the literal action (what exactly is happening with the "muffled thing"), reducing narrative clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    High-density prose with striking imagery ("thumb history," "hearth emptied of ashes") drives the narrative momentum. The prompt-mandated phrases are integrated smoothly, though the structural requirement of "ephemeral cameo appearances" creates a slight rhythmic hiccup in an otherwise flawless flow.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from metaphor congestion (Density penalty), with phrases like "shy thunder," "ribcage songs," and "mirror water" appearing in rapid succession. The beauty becomes breathless and opaque, prioritizing poetic sound over narrative clarity, particularly in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from "Simile-itis," with a repetitive cadence of observation followed by a "like/as" comparison ("like punctuation," "like a held breath," "like a migrating bird," "like a bell"). This figurative clutter distances the reader, and phrases like "dew jeweled" are tired clichés that weaken the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong sensory details ("vans cough themselves awake"). However, the phrase "futuristic nostalgia" is used twice—once as a description and once as a philosophical summary—which feels repetitive and tell-y. The syntax of "It adds a new mark... and I realize it is my own hand" is confusing; the antecedent of "It" is slippery, momentarily obscuring the action.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("room exhaled," "doors... clicked like teeth"), creating a strong textural experience. A few metaphor clusters border on overwriting in the middle section, but the rhythm and imagery generally support the dreamlike tone without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is beautifully crafted with high sensory density, though it occasionally feels overwrought. The integration of the required phrase "messages in condensation on windows" is syntactically awkward within the lantern context ("messages... begin writing"), creating a noticeable artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, with metaphorical density suffocation the scene (e.g., "monitors speak pelagic syllables," "rain ticking like type"). Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, stalling momentum and creating coherence issues (kestrels do not coil; commas do not sleep).

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from severe simile fatigue ("like old theater curtains," "like fruit baskets," "like a chorus," "like small engines"), creating a repetitive syntactic cadence. While individual images are striking, the density of figurative language creates an ornamental layer that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, utilizing a lyric refrain ("In the pause between question and reply") to structure the beats without feeling repetitive. The line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and zero scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is rich and high-quality, with strong rhythms and vivid imagery. However, the density of figurative language (e.g., "sweat became a second language," "tasted cognition") is relentless, occasionally drawing attention to the writing itself rather than the unfolding action.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.2)
    While technically polished, the prose suffers from high metaphor density that often obscures meaning ("chlorophyll woven from losses," "echoes of ink"). Several phrases appear to be prompt-mandated verbatim repetitions ("via half-sung lullabies...") that disrupt the rhythm and create a template-like cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose suffers from metaphorical overcrowding and mixed imagery that occasionally obscures meaning (e.g., "wick a mothwing of cooled thunder" is incoherent visuals; "ribs of whale," "anemones," and "deer on ice" clash within a short space). While rhythmically pleasing, the relentless figurative density reduces line-level clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and dense with domain-specific imagery ("marginal gloss," "vanished grammars"). A few metaphor stacks clutter the momentum (paper becoming a doorbell immediately following opened doors), but the line-level craft is generally precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and high-density but suffers from overwritten descriptions and a repetitive refrain ("as the building breathes") that yields diminishing returns. Forced phrasing related to prompt elements ("slyly heartfelt envelope") creates clumsy semantic artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally polished and rhythmic, but suffers from awkward phrasing required to fit specific prompt elements. "Blooming withering" appears as a jarring grammatical construction, and the repetition of "trust... trust" in the final thematic summary creates a tautological loop that drags on the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery ("scar where lightning had left its handwriting"). The phrase "featherly determined" reads as a forced artifact, and the anaphora at the end ("That is what...") borders on repetitive, but the overall line-level craft is strong and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a high density of figurative language that borders on purple ("shivered the surface into ink," "fish whirled like punctuation"). The relentless metaphorical layering slows the narrative momentum and draws attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    Severely overwritten; simile density suffocates the narrative ("like fish," "like minnows," "like a kite," "like a coin," "like birds," etc.). The relentless figurative language stalls momentum and draws attention to the author rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and evocative, but the density of figurative language is extremely high ("sympathy of old maps," "moon yards itself"), occasionally bordering on overwrought. While technically polished, a few metaphors strain for profundity at the expense of clarity, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor stacking (e.g., "shoulder became a sky... instrument... oath"), which obscures physical action. Additionally, required elements like "spontaneously anchored" and "moonstone cabochon dust speck" are integrated with awkward phrasing that disrupts the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rich, with high information density ("cranes cough beyond the headland"). There is a slight tendency toward "thesaurus-itis" in moments like "litigations" and "noctilucent reckonings," which can slow momentum. Rhythm is generally strong, utilizing anaphora ("I see...") effectively to build the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is mostly stellar, but the forced insertion of prompt phrases ("tried to enlighten himself by reflecting deeply") creates a jarring scaffold artifact that disrupts the otherwise seamless rhythm. Without this slip, the score would be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.9)
    Repetitive vocabulary ("obsidian" used twice in close proximity) and redundant imagery ("invisible wind") indicate a lack of polish. The pivotal action is delivered via summary telling rather than concrete, beat-by-beat prose, draining momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor fatigue; nearly every noun is modified by a figure of speech ("latch clucking," "salt grammar," "refugees in borrowed coats"). This relentless density slows momentum and draws attention to the author's hand rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the prose is evocative, it suffers from a high density of similes ("like shy birds," "as a stranger," "like a sleeper," "like sleeves"), creating a repetitive syntactic cadence that interrupts momentum. The figurative language, though pretty, occasionally crowds the narrative line and feels overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and image-rich ("bitter bouquet of history," "night advanced like a reader"). A few phrases border on purple ("sharpening syllables into razors"), but the rhythm is strong. There are no distracting artifacts or loops; the writing is dense and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from "simile churn," with over ten "like" or "as if" constructions appearing in rapid succession (e.g., "like loose tin," "like a vault," "like a glass set"). This repetitive syntactic pattern creates a mechanical rhythm and a density of ornamental figurative language that impedes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe textual artifacts render the prose unpublishable; phrases like "alarming serenity" and "bodily poetic" are looped four times each in ~450 words. The phrase "moved bodily poetic" forces a grammatical error (adjective phrase as adverb) to meet a constraint, breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally strains for poetic effect with mixed or obscure metaphors ("smoke that forgot its fire," "hush purling"). These moments of overwriting slightly obscure the clarity of the image, though the general flow remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is competent but marred by the conspicuous repetition of complex phrases ("blushing stillness," "transiently rooted," "interrupted cadence") which appear twice each. This redundancy reads as a checklist artifact rather than organic leitmotif.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally lush and precise ("consonant like a boot heel"), but a jarring tense shift in the climactic beat ("Green light spilled in, and I illuminate the draftlines") disrupts the flow. This line-level error in a pivotal moment prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from significant metaphor congestion (e.g., "maze," "scar," "teeth," "lock," "scab," "wafer," "creature" all in the opening), which clogs the reading flow. Additionally, the prompt phrase "precisely playful" is repeated three times in a way that feels mechanical and forced rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is high-density and rhythmic, with strong verbs ("clung," "pried," "buckled"). A slight density of similes in the middle section ("like a dried river," "like violet silk," "like a penitent") momentarily threatens the otherwise frugal voice, but the imagery remains vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is polished, it suffers from a high density of simile-based descriptions ("walls soften like breath," "ripples like sleeping water," "beat louder than a feather," "gusts like a wind," "smiles like a door"). This reliance on "like/as" constructions creates a repetitive scaffold that draws attention to the writing rather than the image. The final metaphor ("door learning it was always a window") is logically slippery.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    While evocative, the prose relies heavily on a repetitive simile structure ("like quiet ash," "like memory," "like bitten moon," "like sleeping birds," etc.), creating a predictable cadence. Additionally, the "bees" imagery is recycled (once for the lens fracture, once for the dream's ribs), which diminishes its freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative with high information density ("wisdom... pretend you meant to kick"). The imagery is consistent and supports the magical realism. There are no major artifacts, though the phrasing occasionally draws attention to its own cleverness rather than dissolving into the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong imagery ("scalped smooth by time," "pit clicked against his teeth"). There are no significant loops or artifacts, and the rhythm supports the story's dream-like quality.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant overwriting and "metaphor muddle" obscure the narrative; phrases like "phonemes that resemble footfalls" and "thin as a proverb" are semantically empty and block visualization. The prose relies heavily on "noun of noun" constructions and abstract similes that dilute the scene's physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose suffers from high simile density ("like a sleeping animal," "like a compass needle," "like a net," "like dawnfire"), creating a monotonous rhythm. Additionally, prompt phrases like "blissfully aberrant" and "trapped freedom" feel inserted as labels rather than organically woven into the syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and imagery, though metaphors are occasionally stacked ("gaps multiplied like rain puddles... reflecting nothing yet distorting everything"). The final paragraph drifts into moralizing summary, slightly stalling the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("blue to the tongue"), though it leans on synesthetic abstraction. A notable artifact is the repetition of the prompt phrase "gently luminous" for both the beings and the stone, which reads as a lexical loop rather than a deliberate echo.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose quality is high, with dense, imaginative imagery and strong rhythmic control. While phrases like "retrocognitively blessed" stick out slightly against the poetic texture, the line-level craft is generally polished and propulsive, effectively conveying the magical realism of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and image-dense, with strong rhythm and sensory specificity ("sun warmed plum," "baker's steam") that grounds the fantasy elements. Occasional overwrought metaphors ("clocks recounting jokes") and the abstract phrasing of the motivation prevent a higher score, but the line-level craft is otherwise precise.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("vines trembled like old aunties laughing"), with a strong rhythmic quality that supports the chanting motif. At times, the density of simile and metaphor ("sound itself were a fragile bird") threatens to slow the momentum, but the imagery generally lands with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphor density that occasionally obscures emotional clarity ("texture themselves into touchable threads"). While the rhythm is good, the reliance on poetic abstraction ("laugh fester," "fear thaw" in close proximity) creates a slight distance from the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in the sensory descriptions. The score is slightly capped by the awkwardness of required phrases like "intangibly tangible" and "stretching contracted," which create minor rhythmic stumbles in an otherwise polished text.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose density is high but controlled, with metaphors ("history of hush," "pinned insects") that serve the atmospheric logic of the piece. The writing teaches its lyrical pattern early, allowing abstract phrases like "leapt... into rumor" to land with emotional weight rather than confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and dense with evocative imagery ("paint brittle as leaves in an archived autumn"). A few moments rely on dense metaphor clusters that slightly slow the pacing during active beats, but the overall craft is high.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but heavily overwritten, with nearly every sentence carrying a simile or metaphor ("night itself had a throat," "shadows... careful as deer," "trembled like winter birds"). This figurative density obscures the action in high-pressure beats, violating the density check for prestigious literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    While the imagery is lush, repetitive phrasing ("machines flirt," "gauges flirt"; "stuttering" twice) in adjacent paragraphs creates noticeable echoes. Phrasing like "stamped with timestamps" adds minor redundancy that disrupts the polish.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("breathing brass"). However, the metaphor density sometimes clutters the image (e.g., "bridge of intuition" leading to "questions wearing boots of grief"), creating a slight drag on clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("staircase written by bees," "constellations that had learned to root") with excellent rhythm. A few phrases lean slightly abstract ("legible breath"), but the overall control is high-caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("exhaling a grit of rooms"). There is a slight over-reliance on the word "unfurl" (appearing three times), but the metaphorical consistency holds. The line-level craft supports the story's atmospheric weight without dragging.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the imagery is often dense, the integration of required phrases creates significant prose artifacts, notably the tautological loop: "suggested a river... suggested by puddle reflections." This repetition breaks the rhythm and clarity of a pivotal transition.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like "past has been rinsed and hung up to dry." However, the final sentence's usage of "at an eerie nostalgia" creates a slight syntactic stumble (treating the emotion as a location/level) that feels like a forced inclusion of a prompt phrase. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from overwriting and high adjective density ("paired syllables of knotted radiance," "coal-pale wind"). While the imagery is lush, the relentless figurative language sometimes slows momentum and draws attention to the author's hand rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally high-density and evocative, but it suffers from awkward phrasing forced by prompt inclusion (e.g., "uncertainly certain," "befriend uncertainty in planning"). These abstract, tell-heavy sentences disrupt the otherwise strong visual flow and flatten the narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and rhythmically controlled, with high information density. However, stylistic artifacts like "luminous regret" (synesthetic abstraction) and "kintsugi intentions" (label-speak) mar the otherwise tactile imagery. The line "frogs practiced a grammar older than books" borders on a literary trope that feels slightly detached from the industrial setting.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwriting and occasional metaphor collapse (e.g., "coins of heat that pretended they were just another cloud" is logically opaque). While the rhythm is good, the density of figurative language sometimes suffocates the action rather than illuminating it.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from "simile fatigue," with a repetitive reliance on "like" or "as" comparisons (confession, compass, gnats, moons, bow, bone, applause, flute) that creates a stuttering, formulaic rhythm. This density of figurative language acts as scaffolding, obscuring the action rather than illuminating it.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is dense and evocative ("Letters rose like fish," "weather held in linen"). Rhythm and cadence are handled with skill. There is a slight tendency toward metaphor stacking which threatens to weigh down the momentum, but the imagery remains lucid and serves the story's magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is dense and high-effort, often evocative ("hush slid down... like silk"), but suffers from occasional mixed metaphors (a ledger lying "like a moth" yet described as "heavy" contradicts the vehicle). The repetition of the phrase regarding the "fluorescent buzz" works as a structural anchor, but some descriptions border on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("tide unsettles a mirror," "braille frost") with excellent rhythmic control. The imagery is strictly consistent with the glass/liquid motif, avoiding mixed metaphors even at high density.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and highly polished, with standout phrases like "breath marks for a silent choir." However, the density of metaphor occasionally strains clarity; "oxidized velvet iron" is difficult to parse visually, and "planets ticking like clockwork grapes" feels like a mixed image that distracts rather than illuminates. The rhythm and sound, however, are largely excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and evocative, but suffers from high simile density ("like wax," "like fruit," "like a key," "like breath"). This figurative saturation occasionally slows momentum, and metaphors like "turned my knuckles to rain" obscure physical reality rather than illuminating it.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and high-density ("ignites bats into punctuation"), creating a thick, immersive atmosphere. The "hinge" motif is repeated six times, which borders on excessive repetition, but the overall rhythmic control and vivid imagery maintain strong momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from extreme metaphor density ("rain like threaded needles," "tide-light," "spun to satin") that stifles narrative momentum. The constant figurative language draws attention to the writing itself rather than the action, violating the density guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong imagery. However, there is a tendency toward syntactic monotony with repetitive "I [verb]" openers ("I reckoned," "I pressed," "I opened," "I took"). Some metaphors feel slightly mixed or over-stacked ("thunder... as a dark petal cupped to the ear").

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is evocative and dense, though occasionally the metaphor load slows momentum ("bones like shutters," "sunk in cooled lava"). The simile "sheriff leaned like a misfiled statute" feels slightly self-conscious, drawing attention to the author's wit rather than the scene's tension.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally high-quality with striking imagery ("debts paid in broomstrokes," "heart of a clock waiting for hands"). However, the forced inclusion of the modern cognitive term "working memory" disrupts the fantasy register, and there is a minor tense slip in the first paragraph ("still she rejects").

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly polished. Images like "verbs that rustle like moths" and "grammar cried for land" are evocative without stalling momentum. While there is a high density of similes (seven distinct "like" constructions), the quality of each image justifies the stylistic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is overwritten with a high density of adjective-noun pairings and metaphors ("frost-laced bells," "pinwheel of germs") that stalls momentum. The scientific phrase "decreasing entropy" creates a jarring register clash with the established mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("braided themselves into thin harps"). However, the forced repetition of the phrase "credibly curious" (once as backstory, once in dialogue) creates a visible prompt artifact that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose rhythm is strong and the imagery is dense ("warmed light into honey"). Some metaphors feel slightly strained or clichéd ("fear and wonder held hands"), but the line-level craft is generally polished.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no visible scaffolding artifacts. Phrasing like "mosaicking silence into fragments of concentrated daybreak" risks being overwrought but lands successfully within the established lyric mode. The rhythm varies effectively between the quiet rituals and the tension of the Queen's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from metaphor density that occasionally obscures clarity (&quot;clocks coughed colors,&quot; &quot;calendars barked at dusk&quot;). While evocative, the relentless synesthesia in high-pressure beats (the capsule opening) distracts from the physical action, prioritizing poetic texture over narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, though metaphor density is high ("wicker lid from a sleeping basket"), approaching purple prose. The style is cohesive but draws attention to itself, occasionally slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and strong imagery. However, it occasionally tips into overwrought "purple" metaphor (otters as "punctuation," mushrooms writing an "alphabet"), which draws attention to the author's hand rather than the story's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("ribs made a spine," "glowed like good data"), with high information density and strong momentum. A few metaphors strain for effect ("exhaled a chalky guidance," "fossil alphabet spelling yes"), but the line-level craft is generally precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic (&quot;cracks the pods with a coachman's care&quot;), but suffers from occasional overwriting and register slips. The metaphor &quot;flags of nasturtiums that love salt like gossip&quot; feels twee compared to the surrounding gravity, and &quot;delete&quot; disrupts the immersion of the antique setting.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes and "as if" constructions ("ears like folded flags," "gait like a patient drummer," "sound like a distant hammer"), creating a repetitive scaffold effect. Some images, like "gums flashing," feel slightly awkward and distract from the otherwise lush description.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.7)
    While mechanically clean, the prose suffers from a high-density "simile loop" artifact ("like a cathedral," "like a lighter god," "like a tide," "like petals," "like a patient animal"). This template cadence creates a droning rhythm that distances the reader during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is imaginative but suffers from a high density of similes ("like thawwater," "like a lantern," "like monks," "like sharks") that creates a repetitive syntactic rhythm and occasionally clutters the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    Metaphor density is extremely high ("patient river," "braided my lungs," "sirens curled"), occasionally clogging the line-level momentum with abstraction. Crucially, the phrase "crisis actor real crisis survivor" is inserted without necessary punctuation or syntactic smoothing, creating a jarring grammatical error in the opening paragraph that disrupts the otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative with high information density ("letters swam like minnows"). The imagery is inventive without becoming cluttered, maintaining a strong rhythmic propulsion throughout the ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense and lyrical, with high-impact imagery like "frayed like a coastline" and "knights scarred with teeth marks." A few metaphors, such as "suspended clouds of wing and doubt," lean slightly toward the abstract/purple, but the overall rhythm and precision are publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is polished, with strong rhythm and evocative imagery ("slid over bone like water over flute holes"). The prose maintains high density, though the reliance on abstract metaphor in the resolution slightly obscures the concrete mechanics of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("language were a small hammer"), but occasionally veers into overwrought abstraction ("rafters drip a tone of dire enchantment"). Some metaphors feel stacked or slightly forced ("bubbles were brief as the inventions"), which creates drag in an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    While the prose is evocative, the density of metaphor occasionally slows momentum and borders on purple, such as "earth nurse had washed fruit" or "ceiling breathes in mineral syllables." These flourishes, while beautiful, risk drawing attention to the author's hand rather than the scene's reality. However, the line-level rhythm is generally strong, and images like "gulls slept and the harbor lights failed" land with precision. The "alphabet on the stones" is a touch abstract but fits the magical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density. However, the insertion of the prompt phrase "screaming tenderness" feels slightly forced, and the climax leans into purple phrasing ("forgiveness borrow my tongue") that momentarily distracts from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is dense and evocative, but suffers from a high frequency of "X like Y" similes (five distinct instances including "wounded animal," "match lit underwater," "bird relearning sky") which creates a repetitive cadence artifact. While the images are individually strong, the structural repetition draws attention to the writing itself, slightly slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no scaffold loops. Images like "terror like a hive under skin" and "laughter snagged on a throat" are fresh and potent, though the simile "lamps retreated like ideas losing nerve" borders on abstract overwriting in an otherwise grounded scene.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished with high density and strong imagery ("lungs ruined by brine"). The phrase "opal dock" is used as a refrain; while effective as a frame, its third repetition feels slightly static in a short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density. However, some metaphors border on the precious ("punctuation of crumbs," "impossible and exact"), and a few abstract phrasings slightly distance the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the prose is polished and rhythmic, the density of similes ("like wounds," "like an egg," "like a spilled bracelet," "like lost sparks," "like a low drum," "like a wound," "like an eyelid") borders on overwriting. This frequent figurative scaffolding distracts from the narrative momentum in places, despite the high quality of individual images.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting; nearly every noun is paired with a modifier or metaphor ("juniper and doubt," "moths that have learned metallurgy," "natural logarithm grown in salt"). While individual images are striking, the cumulative density creates drag and obscures concrete action, violating the economy bias required for the highest bands. The relentless figurative layering distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the prose is evocative, a heavy reliance on simile constructions ("like trout," "like calendars," "like magnesium," "like ants") creates a repetitive syntactic cadence ("simile fatigue"). This density occasionally clogs the momentum, drawing attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from severe metaphor congestion, with similes appearing in nearly every sentence ("like cautious throats," "like a leaving tide," "like sleeping lungs"). This density suffocates the pacing and obscures the physical action behind a veil of constant figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery ("lungs could be sandglasses," "shame speaks faster than honesty"). Rhythm is well-managed, slowing during the ritual and tightening as the storm approaches. Line-level craft supports the story's meditative yet urgent pacing without sliding into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.5)
    While polished, the prose suffers from a high density of similes and metaphors (e.g., "stopped like a throat in smoke," "letters like shy fish") that creates drag during high-pressure beats. The relentless figurative language occasionally obscures the scene's immediacy, triggering the overwriting deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is dense and often lyrical ("dates frayed into symbols"), but suffers from syntactic monotony with a high frequency of "I [verb]" openers in the second half. This scaffold effect dulls the momentum of the ritual actions.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no wasted scaffolding. Metaphors are fresh and structurally integral, such as "time... like a dog that loves you yet watches the open gate." The line-level craft supports the story's atmospheric weight without descending into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and no obvious loops. However, abstract metaphors ("light as a falling permission") and expository sentence structures ("which meant she saw...") occasionally dilute the immediacy. The reliance on summarizing emotional states ("released a tension she had not known she was carrying") reduces the impact of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high-density overwriting and metaphor congestion ("gutters to sing," "softened to commas," "grief smell green"). Nearly every descriptive sentence employs a figure of speech, which creates a "perfumed" texture that occasionally obscures the immediate action. The literal insertion of complex prompt phrases ("I am the... daughter") disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting, with a high density of similes and metaphors ("salted the dark," "purred like cats," "wiped sleet across its eyes") clogging the narrative flow. This figurative clutter distracts from the action and stalls momentum, especially in the pivotal rescue beat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and dense, but occasionally overwrought; the image of a locket photo that "clicked softly with each tremor of her breath" strains physical credibility for the sake of melodrama. Imagery is generally strong, though "haunted euphoria bright as salt" feels like a mixed metaphor that obscures rather than clarifies emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and dense, though occasionally overwrought ("laughed like a tent being opened"). While rhythm is strong, the high density of similes in the climax slightly obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose density is very high but purposeful, with no template loops or scaffold artifacts. Metaphors are bold ("weaponed with silence") yet strictly governed by the established world logic; the rhythm supports the "musical trail" motif without becoming repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density. A few metaphors border on precious ("clocks forgot which wrist they loved," "clauses to blush"), risking stylistic overwriting, but the overall effect is immersive and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but tends toward "purple" overwriting, with metaphors that occasionally strain clarity ("tide hummed like glass"). While the rhythm is controlled, the density of figurative language sometimes slows momentum without adding necessary narrative information.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.9)
    While there are moments of strong imagery ("soot lifted in a skin"), the prose suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and forced prompt repetitions. Phrases like "heart steaming with volcanic tenderness" lean into melodrama and mixed metaphor, reducing line-level clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and evocative but suffers from high metaphor density in peak beats (e.g., "silence had been folded too often," "light tasting of unread letters"). This aesthetic richness slows narrative propulsion and risks obscuring the action during the climax, trading clarity for poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and dense, but the reliance on similes is excessive ("like a saber," "like a scar," "like a cat," "like a nod," "like a full cup"), creating a repetitive texture. The mechanics are otherwise clean, with strong rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    High metaphor density creates drag; similes like "slick as a whispered oath" and "lights sampled the water like bees" feel decorative rather than clarifying. "Signed with his throat" is opaque, confusing the mechanics of a key interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from simile density ("like needles," "like rain," "like teacups") and abstract phrasing. The reliance on "mist" and "prophecy" creates a soft-focus effect that reduces semantic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from simile overload, with "like" constructions appearing frequently in peak beats ("like barnacles," "like sunlight," "like old grudges"). This repetitive figurative structure slows momentum and feels like a stylistic crutch rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and polished, with high information density and strong rhythm. However, the density of similes ("thin as a foal," "like insect wings," "like medics," "like kneeling," "bright as a wound") occasionally draws attention to the writing itself rather than the moment. Despite this slight over-reliance on figurative language, the line-level craft is masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers significantly from overwriting and figurative density that clogs momentum ("tears commas of brine" is a distracting, mixed metaphor; "scarf the color of pending weather" is abstract). The relentless use of simile in nearly every sentence creates a "purple" effect that distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density, where nearly every noun is accompanied by a figurative modifier or simile, creating a sluggish pace. This overwriting obscures the physical action under layers of poetic interpretation, violating the economy required for immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive looping (four uses of "golden shadows," two verbatim uses of "powerfully gentle" and "questioning assumptions"); some metaphors, like "citrus from someone chewing fear," strain credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful ("light found dust like a river finds silt"), though occasionally dense with abstract metaphors that slow momentum. Line-level control is strong, though the "pocket water" simile is slightly opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is lush and density is generally high, sustaining the magical realist tone. However, the opening sentence contains a jarring repetition ("Rain stitched... rain-beaded") that stumbles immediately, and some phrasings ("spidered shatter points") teeter on overwrought. The rhythm is otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers from metaphor congestion ("atoms of nostalgia were practicing breath"), where density obscures clarity and pacing. The relentless figurative language draws attention to the writing itself rather than the story, resulting in "purple" patches that dilute the emotional impact. The rhythm is controlled, but the constant striving for profundity creates a static, heavy texture.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    While competent, the prose suffers from a high density of "noun + verb like [noun]" similes (fragile birds, petals, scholar, skittish ivy, tide, applause). This repetitive structure creates a template cadence that draws attention to the writing itself rather than the action.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly polished ("Hope is hungry," "Beliefs can blacken"). The deliberate repetition of "quietly vivid" to contrast the medicinal bottles with the broker's lies is a brilliant stylistic choice that reinforces the theme without heavy-handedness.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is lush but marred by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("after the anesthesia wears off," "by examining coffee rings") which appear twice almost verbatim. This creates a "checklist" effect that disrupts the rhythm. The "I am [trait]" sentence constructions in the second paragraph are also structurally repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.6)
    While the imagery is dense and imaginative, the prose suffers from a pervasive template cadence ("She [verb]... She [verb]") that flattens momentum. Additionally, some metaphors, like "doors ajar like vowels," strain for effect and reduce clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from severe overwriting and "metaphor muddle"; nearly every sentence employs personification or abstraction ("instrument hums," "river sighs," "windows throw themselves wide"). This density obscures action and reduces the narrative to a static series of images. The rhythm is declarative and monotonous, lacking the variation needed for genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and imaginative ("folding itself inside the car like rain becoming a cup"), though occasionally the density of metaphor verges on congestion. Phrasing like "stern as verdicts" is evocative but slightly abstract. The rhythm is excellent, propelling the reader through the ritual without stumbling, and the integration of technical terms into the poetic frame is skillful.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies heavily on a repetitive simile scaffold ("like clocks," "like misdelivered mail," "like a hidden belt," "like a bent cog"), which creates a monotonous syntactic rhythm. This over-reliance on "like" constructions dulls the vividness of the imagery and feels like a draft-stage artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.2)
    Simile density is critically high, choking the narrative momentum; nearly every noun is paired with a &quot;like&quot; or &quot;as&quot; comparison (15+ instances in a short space). This overwriting distracts from the action, creating a rhythmic monotony that draws attention to the author's effort rather than the story's reality. The prose lacks the economy and precision required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from extreme simile saturation, with "like a [noun]" constructions appearing in nearly every paragraph ("like a monastery," "like a metronome," "like teeth," "like incense," "like a conch," "like a fever," "like doves"). The repetition of "teeth" for both radiators and piano keys (paras 2 and 5) reads as an unpruned artifact. This density obscures the physical action and violates the economy expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose suffers from severe simile saturation, with over a dozen "like/as" constructions (e.g., "like pressed storms," "like ivy," "like potential thunder") cluttering the short text. This heavy ornamentation creates drag, prioritizing poetic signaling over narrative momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose density is high with evocative phrasing ("patient as kelp," "arithmetic left to us"). However, the repetition of prompt-specific phrases like "periodically eternal" and "drifting moored" creates a slight echo that draws attention to the prompt constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from metaphorical density that occasionally obscures clarity (e.g., "hummed the way grief hums," "breathed like a sleeping leviathan"). While evocative, the reliance on similes in high-pressure beats slows the momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is high-density and evocative ("wet loaf," "braid of futures"). There is a minor repetitive artifact with the adjective "wet" used in two key metaphors ("wet loaf," "wet book") within a short span. Otherwise, the sentence-level craft is polished, with strong verbs and avoiding filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative ("skein of air snarling"), but the literal repetition of prompt phrases ("quietly talented" and "somatic markers" both appear twice) creates noticeable artifacts. These repetitions disrupt the otherwise polished flow and give the text a slight "checklist" quality.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from simile saturation (gulls like commas, lens like a tongue, rust like a clock, foam like stone, cards like windows). This density of figurative language, while often beautiful, creates a "template cadence" artifact that obstructs narrative momentum in favor of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("hiccups where time refuses," "fossils"). Rhythm is controlled. A few metaphors feel slightly stacked ("throne of pauses, a crown of near-misses"), bordering on purple, but the overall line-level craft supports the dream-logic well.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with standout lines like "tenderness and infrastructure." Occasionally, the metaphoric density ("snow cooks silence," "rode the cough") slightly obscures the physical action, trading causal clarity for poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but dense with metaphor ("velvet bucket," "spines like sundials"), which sometimes feels ornamental rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("constellations... swaying like lanternfish"). While the required phrase "transliterates emotions" feels slightly clinical against the poetic diction, it is integrated grammatically. Rhythm and momentum are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose has high rhythm and density, but suffers from a "simile artifact"—the text relies excessively on "like [noun]" comparisons (e.g., "like a gull," "like a passport," "like a cough," "like a gavel"). This formulaic pattern appears in almost every paragraph, cluttering the otherwise clean execution.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density; nearly every noun is paired with a simile ("unspools like tape," "curled like husks," "ink a soft bruise"), creating a stifling texture that slows momentum. This relentless figurative layering draws attention to the writing itself rather than the emotional reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is strong, with fresh imagery ("mist licked," "shoulders fell, a small landslide," "useless antlers") and good rhythm. The prose falters primarily where prompt requirements are pasted in without smoothing, but the surrounding text demonstrates high density and control.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose execution is hampered by a severe overuse of "like a [noun]" similes (11 instances in a short text) and repetitive "I [verb]" sentence openers. This syntactic monotony creates a drag on momentum and gives the narration a template-like cadence that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is musically attuned but suffers from repetitive phrasing (e.g., "paint shivers," "timeline shivers") and occasional overwriting. The phrase "synesthetically blessed senses" is a significant artifact that reads like a prompt insertion rather than organic character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is often beautiful, the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("fractally precise," "willowglass hope," "somatic markers," "After the static shock") constitutes a visible scaffold that disrupts immersion. These repetitions read as checklist compliance rather than organic stylistic choices.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and purposeful, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A slight echo in the similes ("thin as a held breath" / "like a held vowel") is the only minor artifact preventing a higher score, but the extended metaphor of language/grammar is executed with high craft.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no scaffold artifacts; metaphors like "hush leans back" are striking. The imagery is lush, though occasionally the density threatens to slow the pacing of the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.6)
    While the prose is generally polished, it suffers from specific artifacts and overwriting. "Vouchsafe safehouses" creates an awkward sonic echo; "moon fragile" is a poetic inversion that feels artificial; "never theatrical ever" is redundant. These slips disrupt the otherwise silver-toned rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.5)
    Distinct phrases are repeated unnecessarily within a short space ("began to percolate" twice; "spindrift serenity" twice), creating visible text artifacts. Some imagery is overwritten or logically strained ("water slapped the hull like a dog too tired to fetch").

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally overwritten with precious imagery (e.g., "mouths too tired to pray"). The high density of figurative language sometimes draws attention to itself rather than the action, slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished and rhythmic ("hospital counting backward" is a standout phrase). There is a slight tendency toward metaphor density (e.g., "street answers the tide with neon sighs") that threatens to overload the imagery, but the prose generally retains strong momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("hours that move like shorebirds," "floorboards remember my weight"). The imagery is consistent and drives the surreal logic. The "atomically reflective" descriptor creates a slight register clash with the mythic tone, and the motivation sentence mentioned in Q6 is a minor drag on flow.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers significantly from the clumsy, verbatim repetition of multi-word prompt phrases ("public art installation" appears three times; "thrush's nest twig spiral" three times). These cumbersome repetitions disrupt the flow and read like a checklist, breaking the immersive quality of the otherwise competent imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("Static had tempers," "silence had accents"), with high information density. A single tonal slip at the resolution ("pancakes") jars slightly against the established grit, but the overall line-level craft is professional and polished.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("steel thorn bright as frost"), but marred by a distinct repetitive artifact: using "looked like a question" as a simile for both the nexus and the lock within a short span. Occasionally, the metaphors border on overwrought ("thinning velvet," "lace of higher breath"), slightly obscuring immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from redundancy and metaphor overload ("glitter bruised to a dull bruise," "sound went quiet"). The reliance on poetic assertion sometimes obscures physical clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from "simile overload" and occasional mixed metaphors ("carrot shaped like a shuttered door") that obscure meaning. While vivid, the relentless use of "like [noun]" constructions ("like a showman," "like a rickety priest," "like wounded cattle") creates a repetitive cadence that draws attention away from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally lush and evocative, but it suffers from visible scarring where prompt phrases ("dynamically observant," "luminous disbelief") are wedged in as labels or ornamental metaphors. Some metaphors feel slightly mixed or overwrought ("moon shedding languages"), though the density is generally well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally high-quality with strong imagery and rhythm. A few phrases skirt the edge of being overwrought ("careless apprentices of gravity"), and the mandatory inclusion of "perceptively calm" results in a clumsy, explanatory sentence that disrupts the otherwise "shown" texture. Overall, the density and polish are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and evocative with high information density ("ink-stained and awake"). While generally strong, it occasionally leans into overwrought figurative language ("lines trembling like held confessions") that draws attention to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is high-density and polished, with striking metaphors ("turn the sky like a crank"). A few phrases border on overwrought ("suspended between teeth and tide"), but the rhythm and imagery largely support the magical realism tone.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and information-dense; phrases like "wrapped in wax paper and rumor" show mastery of compression. A few moments border on overwrought ("blistered by possibilities"), but the style supports the fabulist tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is technically proficient but suffers from a high density of simile constructions ("breathed like," "curled like," "pooled like," "fit him like") that can feel repetitive. While the imagery is beautiful, the relentless figurative language occasionally creates drag, prioritizing texture over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic ("hissed like cymbals dropped down stairwells"), but the opening paragraph suffers from metaphor congestion ("rusted thought," "echoes... asleep," "evaporated applause" in quick succession). While evocative, the density occasionally threatens to obscure the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmically controlled, using the "touching distance" refrain to great effect. While the metaphor-as-fact structures are frequent, they serve the "analogical thinking" concept rather than reading as affectation.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose craft is high-quality, with excellent rhythm and information density; imagery like "names trailing like gulls" lands effectively. While the text is polished, it leans slightly into decorative overwriting in places, but avoids mechanical loops or clumsy artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.0)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from metaphor density and occasional incoherence (e.g., "scalloped like a throat," "voices braided... as posture"). The reliance on abstract figurative language ("light... inhaled," "door made of faces") occasionally obscures the physical action and slows narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density and strong rhythm characterize the prose; the repetition of "daringly methodical" works as a grounding mantra rather than a loop. A minor weak spot is the phrasing "did allude," which feels like a syntactic contrivance to fit the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and evocative imagery. However, the density of figurative language—stacking metaphors like "dew," "springs," and "galaxies" in close proximity—sometimes obscures physical clarity in favor of poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and evocative ("anesthetic smiles," "velvet eating the sharp edges"), though occasionally strains for effect. The image of gravity brushing strings with "a thousand soft eyebrows" is a jarring, confusing metaphor that momentarily breaks immersion. The density of figurative language slows the pace slightly, but the overall craft is high.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is evocative but suffers from high simile density ("like prayers," "like small moons," "like a conch," "like warm rain"), which creates a predictable descriptive cadence. Additionally, a recurring "I [verb]" sentence structure flattens the rhythm in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.6)
    Significant overwriting via simile density; nearly every description uses "like" or "as" (spilled milk, leaf, moon, throat, chalices, gill, seeds, handwriting), stalling momentum. This figurative clutter distracts from the action and creates a repetitive template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("spills truth like sand," "etude of collisions"), maintaining a strong rhythm. A few metaphors border on the baroque (the world as an eyelid/glass pupil), but the line-level control is generally high and propels the narrative efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    While polished, the prose suffers from metaphor density that occasionally obscures clarity ("patience tasted of lake smoke," "eyes held decades of maps"). The relentless figurative language distances the reader from the physical action, triggering a deduction for overwriting under the density check.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and high-density, with strong rhythm and imagery ("distances fold like paper boats"). However, the metaphor density is occasionally overwhelming, with synesthesia (scent of lichen as time, wings writing) sometimes cluttering the clarity of the beat. The line "sky that forgot how to be blue" leans toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("tongue finding a missing tooth"), though the mid-paragraph tense fracture at the pivotal moment marks a significant technical slip.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from metaphor density; nearly every description relies on a "like" or "as" simile (e.g., "like careful planets," "like wet timbered bells," "like algae," "like a shell," "like moonlight," "like temporary birds"), creating a repetitive template cadence that suffocates the imagery. This overwriting obscures the scene's immediacy and triggers the density penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense and imaginative ("rang like compact planets," "snow speak syllables"), maintaining strong momentum. Occasional metaphorical stacking ("stellar doubt pooled... like black dew") borders on overwriting but largely succeeds in establishing the surreal mood.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose density is exceptional, with striking imagery like "vowels holed by salt" and "gentleness broke him like frost breaks a reed." However, a high frequency of sentences beginning with "He [verb]" creates a repetitive template cadence that, while chant-like, risks mechanical drag.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong rhythmic control and fresh imagery ("nodded like a pew creaking"). Line-level craft is high, with no visible scaffolding or artifacts, though a few metaphors ("compassionate arithmetic") lean slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally strong with high density ("lacquered by time"). There are minor slips into abstraction or cliché ("ache he cannot place," "braid into one careful rope of meaning") that dilute the otherwise sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with a density of figurative language ("thaw were thinking," "seeds spilling," "waterfall step through six moods") that obscures clarity. This metaphorical clutter draws attention to the writing rather than the action, significantly slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from some repetitive phrasing ("remembering through muscle memory" appears twice in full) and occasional overwriting ("pondwater," "soap bubbles") that softens the tension. The rhythm generally supports the action well.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense and polished, with strong imagery ("names loosened like threads in seawater"). However, the integration of required phrases occasionally feels mechanical ("slices through pretense" appears twice), and some metaphors border on overwriting ("blade of attention"). The pacing remains controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is dense and polished but leans on familiar literary tropes ("owls stitched the silence") and occasionally mixes metaphors ("voice an oar steering through resistance"). The high volume of figurative language sometimes draws attention to the writer rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.0)
    While there is strong imagery, the prose suffers from "prompt forcing," with specific phrases like "mournfully eager" and "macerate" repeated verbatim in ways that feel artificial. Minor unintentional repetitions (e.g., "air... heavy air") and some clunky syntactic stacks dampen the polish.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense and polished, with high-impact imagery ("laughter here is a margin note"). There is a slight over-reliance on "X like Y" similes (8+ instances), creating a repetitive syntactic cadence. "Interiorizing exteriors" is a somewhat clunky phrase to carry such structural weight, but the overall craft is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, successfully sustaining the heat/coin/bone motif. However, the density of figurative language ("sparks... like fireflies with broken maps") borders on overwriting, and the "penny drops" idiom is leaned on heavily.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is polished but frequently overwrought, with a density of metaphor that sometimes chokes the momentum ("winds braided old advertisements into prayers"). The prose is beautiful but risks being "purple"; the final sentence is a standard fable cadence that feels formulaic.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from metaphor density; nearly every sentence in the opening beats carries a simile or figurative image, which occasionally slows momentum ("hum like a beehive," "crackled like frying rain"). The "frost in the shape of timetables" borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    Imagery is evocative and precise, creating a strong textural experience ("color of bark after rain," "considerate snow"). A few prompt-mandated phrases (e.g., "realistically imaginary") disrupt the flow slightly, but the overall line-level craft is high.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose density is high with strong rhythmic control; images like "ceilings ripple like slow glass" and "heavy as a small moon" work hard. The metaphorical language aligns with the benthic setting, avoiding mixed metaphors and maintaining a cohesive texture throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is polished, there is a high density of repetitive simile structures ("like wind," "like a swallowed star," "like a pocketed sparrow," "like an exit," "like exhausted mailmen," "like leaves," "like a hummingbird"). This creates a "template cadence" artifact that distracts from the otherwise strong imagery, triggering a penalty for density and repetitive scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and evocative, with high-impact imagery ("seal rebuilding in a patient alphabet") that serves the atmosphere. Sentence variety maintains momentum during the high-pressure exit without sacrificing clarity. Repetitions like "crashing hush" function as purposeful musical refrains rather than artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is rhythmically assured but overly dense with figurative language ("ink trembles as if struck by an unseen bell," "cartography of regret"). This relentless metaphor stacking in high-pressure beats obscures the literal action and slows narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the prose is polished, there is a high density of similes ("like patient rain," "like bark," "like dry ink," "like torn script") that creates a repetitive syntactic rhythm and draws attention to the writing over the scene. The "curse is a contract without punctuation" line feels slightly too aphoristic.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from an excessive density of figurative language, particularly in high-pressure beats where clarity is needed. A repetitive reliance on simile constructions ("like the soil," "like citizens," "like a thaw") creates a rhythmic artifact that slows momentum and clutters the action.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting; nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor ("fog licks," "yawns," "hum," "halos"), creating a density that obscures the action. This metaphorical crowding reduces clarity and impact, prioritizing decoration over narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical density; nearly every sentence employs personification or simile ("shadows stitching," "maps exhaling"), creating a breathless quality. This relentless figurative language occasionally slows momentum and obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the imagery is lush, the prose suffers from metaphor density ("manuscript of patience," "lantern made entirely of listening") that occasionally obscures clarity. Additionally, a repetitive "He [verb]" sentence-starter cadence appears frequently in the middle section (He traced, He understood, He lifted, He placed), creating a mechanical rhythm that drags on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is marred by "simile churn"—an overreliance on "X like Y" constructions (coastlines, candles, compass roses, lighthouses, lullabies, commas, tide charts). This template cadence dulls the impact of individual images and creates a predictable rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose suffers from extreme metaphorical density, with nearly every sentence carrying a figure of speech that slows momentum. The reliance on "as if" and "like" similes (over a dozen instances) creates a filter that distances the reader from the events. While evocative, the writing is overwrought and lacks the rhythmic variety needed for higher impact.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is evocative ("shards bright as wet teeth"), but suffers from a high density of simile scaffolding ("like fog," "as if doors," "like a hinge," "like gauze," "like a moth"). This structural repetition creates a filter that distances the reader from the immediate action in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is high-density and evocative ("cracked into syllables," "silt language"), though the relentless metaphorical layering occasionally threatens to slow momentum. The line "Truth can be a bruise or a bell" leans slightly toward aphorism but fits the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)
    While mechanically polished, the prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and high simile density ("decree like a broom," "day shaped like a decade"). Abstract phrasing often obscures physical reality ("eyes steady in that quiver only resolve can fake").

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is dense with figurative language ("mist breathed a radiant hush," "bread learning to rise") that occasionally obscures physical action in favor of poetic effect. While technically proficient, the high metaphor density slows momentum and creates a layer of abstraction between reader and scene.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm and sonic control are strong, but the text suffers from high metaphor density in peak beats ("scattering prisms," "grip that remembered winter," "bell struck from inside" all in one sequence). This layering of figurative language slows the momentum of the climax and risks overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery ("stubborn as a knuckle," "purl through the gaps") that reinforces the themes of age and texture. The rhythm supports the pacing well, slowing down appropriately during the descent into the vault. No significant artifacts or loops; the craft is polished.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is polished but overwritten in places ("salt had started to learn the alphabet of ruin," "mercy in his syntax"), bordering on purple. The high density of metaphor occasionally obscures the physical reality of the scene, prioritizing sound over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally high-quality but occasionally strained by mixed metaphors ("rang like a bowl of breath"—breath does not ring; a bowl of it is an odd image). The prompt-mandated phrases ("tinkersong wonder," "driftingly alert") feel inserted rather than organic, creating minor artifacts in the line-level flow.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from severe metaphor congestion (nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor), violating the density check. The repetitive structural scaffold ("On the [nth] rise") creates a monotonous template cadence that stalls momentum. The high density of figurative language obscures clarity and creates a "purple" effect.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is evocative but suffers from a high density of "X like Y" similes (lanterns, diary, pendulums, cathedral, veins, librarian, moth, horse, rosary) that creates a repetitive template cadence. Additionally, the specific phrase "quietly explosive" is used twice (lines 3 and 9), creating a distracting echo.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Imagery is evocative ("green by time," "cool rain on stone"), but the "breath" motif is repetitively overused ("held breath," "breath chooses," "room seems to breathe," "world holds its breath"). The line-level rhythm is otherwise strong, supporting the tension of the countdown.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and dense, driving momentum with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, the climax suffers slightly from metaphor stacking ("ribs were lantern slats," "hands rang like bowls"), where the figurative language nearly crowds out the literal action.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished but suffers from abstract phrasing ("driftwood nostalgia") and clunky repetition of the full phrase "clockmaker's gear assortment." The reliance on standard lyrical markers (hush, thaw, constellations) borders on "purple" overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lyrical density borders on purple prose ("gnarl our hope," "threaded... like a humble comet"), creating resistance rather than propulsion. The grammatical error in the final act ("reexamine" vs "reexamined") and repetitive list structures indicate a need for rigorous line-editing.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative with high information density ("lens was cut from a pane of hush"). Rhythm is controlled and supports the lullaby motif. A few moments border on metaphorical overload ("politics learned its favorite thunder"), but the style remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally high-quality and dense ("folded like a fist opening"), but occasionally slips into overwrought personification ("peaches rehearse seduction") that calls attention to itself. The label-telling ("offhandedly exact") weakens the immediate impact of the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Imagery is often striking, particularly the "barbed tatters" and "swallows stitched the air." However, some sentences struggle with rhythm or clarity due to complex clause structures or prompt insertion ("mist the sun kept almost, but not quite, lifting"), creating minor drag in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    A suffocating density of "like/as" similes (appearing nearly every other sentence) creates a filter that distances the reader from the action and stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from high-density simile overload ("like ash," "like a question," "like brine," "like old rope," "like a child," "like dunes"), creating a template cadence artifact. This figurative muddle distracts from the immediate action, especially in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is dense with imagery but suffers from "purple" overwriting, where nearly every noun gets a modifier ("patient revolutions," "gravelled rain," "patient knuckles"). The reliance on telling-labels to explain away plot mechanics ("Because she is empathetically decisive") weakens the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting, with similes or metaphors appearing in nearly every sentence (e.g., "lung," "compass," "phonograph," "jellyfish," "choir"). This violates the density check, as the figurative language clogs the narrative flow and obscures the literal action. The result is a texture that feels suffocating rather than precise.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is ambitious and rhythmic but suffers from metaphorical congestion ("sound narrows to a wick," "bruise smiling") that occasionally obscures meaning. The reliance on dense adjective-noun pairings ("imprecise grief," "gentle verdicts") sometimes reduces clarity in favor of lyricism, dragging on the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose rhythm is disrupted by the mechanical insertion of long prompt phrases (e.g., "taught me by analyzing stress cracks and patience"), which create syntactic stumbles. The repetitive looping of "empathy in motion" creates significant drag.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, with strong imagery ("wind uncaught by turbines," "counting rain by its absences"). A few abstract-concrete pairings (e.g., "half hinges and hope") lean slightly toward sentimentality, but the overall density and propulsion are high quality.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose suffers from metaphor congestion and synesthetic overload ("silence smells like antiseptic oranges," "tastes like rain withheld," "silence is sand," "silence is dough"). While vivid, the density of figurative language occasionally obscures clarity and strains credibility (e.g., "moth lungs," "hail" described as "light").

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is dense and atmospheric but suffers from occasional overwriting and mixed metaphors (&quot;stitched the canopy,&quot; &quot;truths had teeth&quot;). The phrasing &quot;turning of the tide's thought&quot; appears verbatim twice, feeling like a forced insertion rather than a natural temporal anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and lush, with high information density and strong rhythmic control ("whirling silence that folds sound into velvet"). A few metaphors verge on mixed or overly dense ("starlight in honey," "braided like reeds"), but the line-level craft is generally commanding.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong sensory anchoring ("mothball sweetness," "slow animal breathing"). A few metaphors verge on overwrought ("wind learned a new trick"), but the rhythm and line-level propulsion are largely excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is rhythmically strong and dense with imagery ("notes that blinked like tiny trapped suns"), fitting the fable mode. A few metaphors strain slightly ("skin of the air," "whale-road tremor"), but the language generally elevates the material without collapsing into incoherence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the prose is evocative, it suffers from metaphor crowding (e.g., velvet, scar, pupil, house similes in close succession). A significant mechanical error occurs with the forced capitalization of the prompt phrase "Avalanchingly quiet," which breaks the immersion of an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally exquisite, with high information density and evocative imagery ("metal logic becoming breath"). However, a recurring syntactic scaffold—using "because" clauses to explain world-building mechanics in the first half—creates a slight drag on momentum (e.g., "They call me... because...", "My workshop smells... because...", "The fragment fell... because..."). This repetitive explanation structure prevents the prose from reaching the highest tier, though the line-level beauty remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.5)
    Metaphor density severely hampers momentum; nearly every sentence relies on a simile ("like sugar thread," "like a lit pear," "like a leaf"), creating a static, decorative texture. This relentless figurative language obscures the concrete action of the climax and violates the density guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.3)
    High density of imagery, but marred by a persistent "I [verb]" sentence structure that creates a drag on momentum. Some metaphors verge on mixed or overwrought ("grieving the ache of cheerful irresponsibility," "music etched itself across the ice"), though the general polish is high.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from high metaphorical density that occasionally obscures meaning ("sirens bit it away"). A significant flaw is the verbatim repetition of distinctive phrases ("stoically sparkling," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry," "raveling silence"), which read as mechanical insertions rather than intentional refrains.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.5)
    The score is heavily penalized for "scaffold loops"—multiple prompt phrases ("between understanding and confusion," "coax resilience from rubble") are repeated verbatim or near-verbatim across the text. These repetitions act as checklist artifacts that disrupt narrative immersion and create a mechanical rhythm distinct from the story's natural flow.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Imagery is evocative and dense ("planetary aurora poured into cheap tempered glass") with high propulsion. The repetition of the specific phrase "cyclically spontaneous" works as a rhythmic motif but remains slightly visible as a structural artifact; otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from extreme simile saturation, with "like" or "as" constructions appearing nearly every few sentences ("like a tidepool," "like scripture," "like salt," "like a net"). This figurative clutter acts as a scaffold that distances the reader from the immediate action, prioritizing poetic ornament over clarity and momentum. The writing is polished but overwritten, slowing the pace significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and density issues; nearly every sentence carries a heavy metaphorical load ("gulls scatter as if jokes were lightning," "thunder grins"), creating a "purple" texture that obscures physical action. The repetition of key verbs ("steer," "laugh") borders on monotonous loop artifacts rather than purposeful anaphora.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the imagery is evocative, the prose relies heavily on a repetitive simile structure ("like a patient lung," "like a pebble," "like steam," "like ash," "like rain"). This template cadence creates a predictable rhythm that dulls the propulsion and feels like a stylistic crutch in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and high-density ("sharpness of sugar" is a standout), but relies too heavily on "like" similes ("like a sleeping boiler," "like a river," "like silvered vines," "like rinse water"). This repetitive syntactic structure creates a predictable cadence that dampens the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is lush and imaginative, with strong rhythm and imagery ("hush like skirts," "waxy laughter"). However, the density of metaphor occasionally slows momentum, and there is a tendency to summarize the emotional takeaway ("We knit communities together...") rather than strictly showing it. Some phrasing borders on purple, though it remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from extreme metaphor density, where nearly every noun is paired with a figurative image ("syllables were birds," "absence is my coat," "tea... like a hand"). This relentlessly poetic register creates drag and obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is dense but suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and forced prompt insertion; the repeated phrase "heuristically gentle" is a jarring register error in a poetic text. Some metaphors lean toward purple ("leaves open like fists relaxing," "contract written in patient sap"), obscuring clarity for the sake of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the imagery is vivid ("glass screamed," "hues aligned"), the verbatim repetition of "sampling frequencies" (four times) and "gently meticulous" creates a mechanical text artifact. These loops disrupt the prose rhythm and prevent the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled ("brittle inhale like glass deciding to be sand"), creating a strong atmospheric texture. While occasional metaphors feel slightly overwritten ("nerves braided with lantern light"), information density and sensory precision are consistently high.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is inventive and information-dense, though occasionally overwrought ("gravity reciting her biography") in a way that slows momentum. The sensory imagery is precise, but the relentless figurative language sometimes obscures the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.7)
    Simile fatigue is significant; nearly every description uses "like" (veins, streets, tide, dawn, seeds, riddle, stepping stones, jaw, tinnitus, breath). This algorithmic cadence ("Noun verb like Noun") creates a dense, overwrought texture that slows momentum and distracts from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. However, some metaphors border on overwrought or slightly imprecise (e.g., "mice with mapmaker teeth," "tooth finding its jaw"), creating momentary friction in an otherwise polished text.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, relying on a "verb + like/way + noun" simile template in nearly every paragraph ("like a sleeping throat," "like furled clouds," "like a careful hand," "way gardeners tune," "way water tunes"). This repetitive cadence creates a dense, purple texture that distracts from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with striking imagery ("water burns in memory the way coal glows in air"). While moments like "daggering... like desire" verge on overwriting, the overall texture is sophisticated and propulsive without scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from extreme metaphor density, with nearly every sentence carrying a figurative weight that obscures the action (&quot;each rib a rumor,&quot; &quot;accession number made of breaths&quot;). Phrases like &quot;bottled lightning&quot; and &quot;dusted with calm&quot; veer into cliché or strained imagery, creating a texture that feels overwritten and performs emotion rather than evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from extreme metaphor density that stifles momentum and clarity. Nearly every noun is modified by a figurative image ("silver fish stitched... like cursive annotations," "measured... as a spider spins"), creating a "purple" texture that draws attention to the writer rather than the scene. This overwriting obscures the action and mechanics of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with standout lines like "gulls argue over syllables they cannot carry" and "darkness thinks it will keep the sea to itself." The rhythm supports the magical realist tone perfectly. A minor note: the metaphor "bursting the page" risks a meta-fictional break that slightly jars against the established diegetic reality.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.0)
    Imagery is often striking, but the prose suffers from metaphor density ("blaze of listening," "lantern of calm") and syntactic monotony, with most sentences following a rigid Subject-Verb structure. This creates a drumbeat rhythm that drags the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is high-quality and evocative but falls into a repetitive "He [verb]" sentence cadence in the middle paragraphs ("He said," "He kept," "He told"). Additionally, the relentless density of linguistic metaphors ("syntax of weight," "grammar of that admission," "translating water") occasionally feels suffocating.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is competent but marred by the verbatim repetition of distinctive phrases ("tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve," "translate isolation into independence") at the beginning and end. These echoes feel mechanical rather than resonant, exposing the scaffolding of the prompt requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from occasional "purple" over-density ("stalactites tempo my strokes," "a mere ruby answers"). There is a tendency toward repetitive phrasing ("unfinished" appears four times; "quiet" is repeated) and parallel constructions ("bows like a reed... rises like breath") that draw attention to the writing's scaffold rather than the image itself.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose density is high with fresh imagery ("silence full of teeth"); sentence rhythm supports the "singing" motif. The double usage of "progressive disclosure" is slightly jarring against the lyrical register, but the line-level craft is otherwise precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from metaphor congestion ("sky brightens like an eyelid," "prayers drift like plankton"). The line "cut corners so hard the ship blushed" is a tonal break and a mixed metaphor that disrupts the gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically sophisticated, with high information density and evocative imagery ("laundry wounds," "lantern throats"). While the writing occasionally borders on preciousness given the density of adjectives, the line-level craft effectively supports the elevated, fable-like mood without dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with high information density. Metaphors like "shredded in a final snow of denial" and "herd of hammers" are striking and effective. There are no visible loops or artifacts, and the rhythm creates a strong sense of momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    High density and lyrical strength, though metaphor saturation occasionally threatens clarity ("survivor's rope," "tasting winter"). The prose is polished but risks purple patches that distance the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is rhythmically assured and dense with imagery, but leans on adjectival excess ("positively wistful," "lonesome splendor") and sentimental oxymorons ("happy ache"). The density of metaphor sometimes obscures concrete action, prioritizing poetic flourish over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is dense and often evocative ("counting turns the way sailors count scars"), though it occasionally tilts into purple territory ("light bled honey"). The prompt phrase "fleshly ethereal" is inserted verbatim twice, creating a repetitive artifact that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, relying on a "verb like noun" simile structure in nearly every paragraph ("clean as hammered glass," "plumes like banners," "like a struck harp," "like hoofbeats," "like a sleeping animal," "like flint"). This repetitive figurative scaffolding stifles momentum and distracts from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with standout imagery like the "wick drew in vapor like a lung." However, the density of figurative language—metaphors of braiding, resonance, and teaching darkness—clusters thickly in the middle, threatening to slow momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    Technically polished, but suffers from metaphor congestion; nearly every description relies on a simile ("like slow fish," "like a doubt," "like a sliver of midnight"). This density creates a lush texture but slows propulsion and can feel overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from significant simile density ("hissed like a living kettle," "like a saint," "like a gull," "like a dog," "like a conspirator"), creating a repetitive syntactic artifact. The frequent figurative language borders on overwriting, distracting from the physical action and creating a "scaffold" effect.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density. However, there is a tendency toward simile churn ("like a tide," "like a mouth," "like surf," "like justice") which occasionally draws attention away from the action. Phrases like "smelled... of unsung birthdays" strain sensory logic, crossing into sentimental abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from a high density of similes ("like tired wolves," "like trapped birds," "like a quiet choir," "like ropes," "like a page turning"). This repetition creates a formulaic rhythm that drags on the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.3)
    While ambitious, the prose suffers from overwriting and mixed metaphors that obscure clarity. Phrasing like "wind carried a hush that felt like windborne solace brushing ribs from within" creates a redundancy loop (wind/windborne) and anatomical confusion. Phrases like "whistle shaped gullish" and "shuffled like boots that forgot themselves" trip the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is suffocated by metaphorical density, with nearly every sentence carrying a simile ("hushes like," "bow like," "creaks as if," "fragile as"). This "purple" overwriting creates a sluggish rhythm and draws attention to the author's effort rather than the scene's reality, obscuring the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("words settle like birds, talons folding"). The rhythm mimics the "calm" the characters seek to maintain. A few metaphors lean towards abstraction, but the line-level craft effectively supports the atmosphere and pacing without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from figurative overwriting; metaphors like "bees stitched yellow punctuation" and "wind smelled like... moonlight" prioritize aesthetic flourish over clarity. These poeticisms occasionally clutter the line level and distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lush but occasionally overwritten, with a high density of personification ("Dawn leans its neck") that slows momentum. The philosophical translations of the crystal's sounds ("Growth begins in refusal") tell rather than show, acting as scaffolding for the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Syntactic monotony heavily impacts the rhythm; nearly every sentence opens with a "He [verb]" structure ("He said," "He carried," "He chalked"). Additionally, a high density of "like" similes (silt, rain, clock, metronome, tide) creates distance and feels constructed rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lush but suffers from metaphor congestion (light as animal, camera as city, clock as colleague) that occasionally muddies the imagery. A distinct tense error ("had a clock hand that won't stop") and the grammatically awkward insertion of "when foundations shake" disrupt line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.0)
    Rhythm and sentence variety are competent, but the prose relies on worn clichés ("dawn lifts like a curtain," "eyes ocean deep") that flatten the imagery. While the musical descriptions are inventive, these stock phrases lower the overall craft score.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Metaphor density is excessive, with nearly every noun modified by a simile ("patient lung," "asleep like cattle," "pinned like receipts," "ring like a throat"). This relentless figurative language creates a barrier to immersion and slows momentum, obscuring the physical reality of the scene in favor of poetic ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically strong, with high information density. However, the metaphor density is occasionally overwhelming (e.g., "clue humming at a pitch of childhood," "fountain muttered in a dialect of abandoned plans"), bordering on pathetic fallacy that slightly distances the reader from the immediate physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Metaphor coherence fails in the opening ("breathe its petal-cool softness like a compass" is logically opaque; compasses do not breathe or possess softness). Additionally, clichés like "milk into tea" dilute the otherwise specific imagery, triggering coherence and artifact deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose density is high with strong rhythm and vivid imagery ("fossil of sunlight," "pale dots"). While a few similes lean slightly precious ("quiet like tea"), the line-level craft generally supports the elevated tone without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from a heavy "simile scaffold" artifact. The construction "X [verb] like Y" is overused (10+ instances: "lean forward like listeners," "clicked... like a whispered metronome," "thickened like ink," "played like grass"). This syntactic repetition creates a predictable drone that dampens the imagery's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density that obscures physical action ("trusts dew to teach," "air braid meaning," "silence is a tool"). This constant figurative layering halts momentum and creates a "purple" texture where sentimentality replaces concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally high-density with striking imagery ("sap frozen mid-throb," "humming like a moth"). However, the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "demonstrating patience physically" creates a noticeable scaffold artifact that disrupts the otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    While individual images are evocative, the prose suffers from significant "simile churn," utilizing the "X like Y" construction over ten times (e.g., "like cooled iron," "like a memory," "like fruit"). This structural repetition creates a predictable rhythm that dulls the imagery's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density that occasionally obscures meaning (e.g., "saltshaken hand," "coins discussing the afterlife of pockets"). While often beautiful, the constant figurative layering creates a "metaphor muddle" that slows momentum and feels performative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.3)
    The piece suffers from an extreme density of similes (ropes like skins, tigers like uncles, whistle like child, kettle like cat) that clogs the narrative flow. This "figurative muddle" draws attention to the writing itself, rendering the prose decorative and static rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but the density of figurative language in the first half ("thinking water," "bones learning arithmetic," "silence like a map") borders on overwriting. While beautiful, the relentless metaphor stack occasionally threatens to obscure the immediate action. The climax clarifies nicely, relying on strong verbs ("admit, forgive"), which saves the score.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density; nearly every sentence employs personification or simile ("silence took inventory," "sinks coughed"), creating a breathless, overwrought texture. A scaffolded list pattern ("I rerouted...", "I flipped...", "I reversed...") dulls the momentum in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwriting and strained metaphors ("origami thunder," "news carried by ants"). The density of figurative language sometimes obscures the moment rather than illuminating it, slowing narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose has a smooth rhythm but suffers from metaphor density that borders on overwriting (e.g., "parchment ribbon," "ribbed like bracing," "exhaled a breath" all early on). This heavy figurative layering distracts from the action and creates a sense of artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is rhythmic and visually rich, though occasionally overwrought with dense similes (e.g., "hush settled... the way seed husks settle"). While imagery is strong, the text suffers from some aphoristic telling that disrupts the scene's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally vivid and polished ("bruise themselves fragrant"), but slips into accidental jingles ("hauling hope on a rope") and formulaic phrasing ("not a breaking but an irrigating") that disrupt the literary texture.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from severe simile overload ("speckled as," "warm as," "like forgiveness," "like a lantern," "like old judges"). This constant figurative scaffolding suffocates the narrative momentum and often results in mixed or abstract metaphors (e.g., "metronome of quaking reverie").

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.3)
    Metaphor density is excessive ("sea opening lungs," "gulls like runes," "mouth of wood"), obscuring the physical reality of the scene and triggering deduction for overwriting. The prose frequently prioritizes poetic sounding phrases over clarity and momentum, creating a "purple" texture.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from the clumsy, verbatim repetition of the phrase "realistically imaginative" (four times), which creates a jarring rhythmic artifact. While some imagery is vivid ("colors trod the ground like barefoot children"), the density of metaphor sometimes obscures clarity. The prompt phrases feel pasted in rather than woven into the sentence structure, damaging flow.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, but there are noticeable repetition artifacts (the phrase "approximates infinity" appears in paragraphs 2 and 5). The reliance on abstract nouns (hush, tender, infinity, mercy) softens the impact of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, clogged with dense metaphors ("feet were commas trembling with the authority of mercy") that obscure the physical reality of the scene. This "purple" style prioritizes ornament over narrative momentum, resulting in a text that feels curated rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("grief were slop in the bearings"), with strong rhythm and sensory detail. However, the density of metaphors in the middle section ("waits like a wound," "world shivers," "plank of silence") briefly threatens to stall momentum. The recurring full-phrase usage of "tidal obsidian ridge" feels slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is dense with metaphors ("echoes... like migrating birds," "knots sit like punctuation"), bordering on purple. The misuse of the sovereign case (a small object) as a container for large legal documents creates a distracting logical break in the final imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative ("Snow scratched the windows like a quill"), but the repeated four-word noun stack "kingfisher feather quill nib" becomes a rhythmic stumble. The final paragraph's shift into abstract philosophical summary slightly flattens the linguistic energy.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is lush and rhythmically controlled ("moths wrote jittery annotations"), passing the read-aloud test. However, the density of figurative language is high, occasionally slipping into mixed or obscure imagery ("translated by a wary hallway," "choreography for grit") that prioritizes sound over precise meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from high metaphorical density ("house exhales dust," "brittle bones," "porcelain cracks," "river," "storm," "cathedral"), creating a texture that occasionally feels overwritten. The mandatory phrase insertion in the final sentence results in a tautology ("chair slows itself, as the old rocking chair finally slows"), damaging the rhythm of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with no wasted motion or scaffold artifacts. Repetitive phrasing ("sedimentary layers") functions as a rhythmic refrain rather than a loop, enhancing the mythic quality of the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished but suffers from high metaphor density ("varnished air," "soft arithmetic," "hope tapping in threes") that occasionally drifts into abstraction. This poetic overwriting softens the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose suffers from excessive figurative density (Simile Storm), with constructions like "sighed like a patient beast" and "smooth as a polished thought" appearing too frequently. This constant comparison draws attention to the writing rather than the action, obscuring the scene's reality under layers of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    Imagery is generally lush and effective, but the climax is marred by a distracting grammatical slip ("lightning breath thread down" instead of "threaded"). The metaphor density occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and simile fatigue (over 15 "like" constructions in a short text). While individual images are evocative, the density of figurative language chokes the narrative momentum and creates a rhythmic drone.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is marred by severe, scaffold-like repetition of specific phrases ("cascading revelations," "incisively kind," "structural weakness" each appear three times). This creates a mechanical, template-like cadence that disrupts the lyrical tone and feels like forced prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, imagistic, and propulsive ("grain sings like paper under charcoal"). The required phrasing "balancedly daring" is inherently awkward and trips the rhythm slightly, but the author integrates it as smoothly as possible. The surreal logic is conveyed with high-definition clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but leans into repetitive motifs ("saffron quiet" appears twice; "moon-tipped" three times). Some imagery borders on the abstract or mixed ("brush drank moonlight as if it remembered the mouth of a river"). The density of adjectives slows momentum slightly without always adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high-impact imagery ("courage felt edible and breakable," "stage curtains bled honey"). The sentences have strong rhythm and propulsion. While the metaphorical density is high, it suits the fabulist tone and rarely obscures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("practiced sin," "slow exhale"), maintaining high momentum. While the density of similes is high ("like old lovers," "like a throat," "like fever"), they are specific and pattern-taught, creating a cohesive texture rather than feeling like scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no scaffolding artifacts. Images like "film quivered like meat" and "sutures it shut" are visceral and original, propelling the narrative without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("clouds dragged their hems low and hoarse"), maintaining high momentum. A few metaphors risk mixing (orchard as chorus line vs. driftwood vs. instrument), and "fractal generating memories of coral" is syntactically clunky, but the overall rhythm is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmically strong, but the density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("sunflowers," "light through deep water," "pressure that bruises" in quick succession) slightly blunts the immediacy of the climax. The craft is otherwise impeccable with zero scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dense, high-quality prose with strong rhythm and information density. The "throat of shadow, the platforms throatless" imagery acts as a minor metaphor collision that feels repetitive, but the "careful silence" and "trembles like ivy" lines compensate with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is overly dense with figurative language, triggering the density penalty; nearly every noun is modified by a metaphor or personification ("tripod coughs," "wind... reluctant broom," "lighthouse shutting its eye"). While some images land, the relentless density clutters the reading experience and draws attention to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically assured, with high information density and evocative imagery ("stone lung," "soft bruise"). A few metaphors verge on opacity ("scavengers speaking into cans of tin"), but the overall control is masterful. The line-level craft supports the "stillness" of the piece, avoiding clutter while delivering rich texture.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose suffers from "simileitis," with a high density of "like" and "as" constructions (e.g., "like a spoon," "like a confession," "faithful as thunder") that clutter the imagery. While individual images are beautiful, their frequency acts as a scaffold that distances the reader from the action. "Faithful as thunder" is a mixed metaphor that momentarily confuses the physical logic of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is high, but the density of "X like Y" similes (nine instances) risks stalling momentum and creating a template cadence. The lyrical density occasionally borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the imagery is inventive ("tremor into script"), the prose suffers from figurative density ("drink photons and doubt," "storing thunder") that obscures physical action. The relentless metaphorical layering slows momentum and draws attention to the writing itself rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, but the integration of the required phrase "sieved hush" results in a clunky, repetitive sentence ("sieved hush sifted... like wind searching a sieve"). Some metaphors feel strained ("tide published ledger praying"), drawing attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    A specific, unique phrase ("furrowed hush") is repeated verbatim in the first and final third, constituting a text loop. The density of figurative language (similes in nearly every sentence) slows momentum and feels ornamental rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from a severe overuse of a specific simile template ("clung... like a worry," "hammering... like a judge," "collapse... like planks," "stepped... like careful giants"). This repetitive rhythmic loop distracts from the narrative and dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high and momentum is strong, but the prose suffers from metaphor crowding. Phrasing like "filigree etched into muscle memory" mixes metaphors (wirework vs. etching vs. biology), and "draped everything like fog over neon" is slightly heavy-handed. The line-level craft is competent but occasionally overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    While the imagery is lush, minor technical slips mar the polish (missing article in "from cookie we cracked"; grammatical ambiguity in "cardamom loop to wrist"). Some metaphors lean toward abstraction ("rustle that means change"), creating occasional opacity in the otherwise dense prose.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and imaginative ("tick-motes," "slurry of minutes"), driving the surreal atmosphere. However, the density of figurative language is high (e.g., "glade exhaled," "clouds closed like curtains"), occasionally bordering on overwriting in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is dense with figurative language ("unborn futures shivered like moths," "mass is a conversation," "hinges screamed"), which often borders on purple. While rhythmically sound, the relentless metaphor stacking occasionally obscures the physical reality of the scene and slows the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("extraction of panic from the marrow"), though occasionally borders on mixed metaphor ("unscrolled its careful ballet," "tongue of a life"). Information density is high, with no wasted scaffolding or repetitive loops.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is severely overwritten, with nearly every sentence burdened by personification or metaphor ("medals dreaming," "wires... snakes"), which violates the clarity and momentum standards. This density obscures the action in high-pressure beats, prioritizing ornamental language over narrative precision.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally lush and evocative ("sea sang like wire"), but the density of metaphor occasionally slows momentum ("sibilant grammar"). A few phrases ("swallowing fear like a thin blade," "tasted like salt and iron") lean on familiar clichés that dilute the otherwise fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, with a density of simile and metaphor that stifles momentum. A severe repetitive artifact occurs with the phrase "furiously tranquil," which appears four times in a short space, reading as a forced motif rather than a natural description. This repetition, combined with the relentless figurative language ("storm-kissed," "arterial lines," "skin milky"), creates a cloying texture that needs aggressive pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the prose is polished, the high density of similes ("like a thesis," "like a locksmith," "like a bread roll") creates a "metaphor fatigue" that drags on the pacing during high-pressure beats. A few images are brilliant, but the sheer volume dilutes their individual impact and distances the action.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and image-dense, often achieving beauty. However, it occasionally tips into purple overwriting ("luminous fracture," "soft economy spending itself"), and there is a reliance on list-like sentence structures to generate rhythm. The density sometimes slows momentum without adding narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.8)
    A severe template-cadence issue undermines the otherwise beautiful imagery; over 15 sentences begin with "He [verb]" ("He watched," "He pried," "He threaded," "He took," etc.). This repetitive syntax creates a droning rhythm that drags on momentum and distracts from the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is polished, the density of figurative language is relentless ("jurors," "rumor," "archivists," "bruise," "fist," "commas" all appear as metaphors/similes). This constant stylization creates a "purple" texture that distances the reader from the physical action. The metaphor saturation borders on overwriting, obscuring the scene's mechanics in favor of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.8)
    The phrase "rhythmically placid" appears five times, including at the closure, creating a severe repetitive artifact/text loop that flattens the prose rhythm. This redundancy significantly undermines the otherwise high-quality lyrical density.

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences open with concrete nouns, shift to participle phrases only when mirroring slow accretion. No scaffold loops; each line adds either sensory grain or causal push. Figurative language is controlled—one metaphor per beat, none stacked. Information density is high: “tomatoes gone to filaments” does world, loss, and biologic decay in five words.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Metaphor density is high but patterned (heat/kiln/frost) and pays off in closure; no mixed vehicles. One scaffold loop: “pauses were doors, and doors could be shut” could compress, but does not obscure因果. Strong verb choice—“flaking its own moons,” “braided with the hush.” Read-aloud rhythm legible. No artifact touches the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rare loop-free density: every sentence layers body, tool, or atmosphere while advancing the score-of-heat. Metaphors are precise and non-contradictory—“breath makes small clouds, sensors draw those clouds into a choir of light.” Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif without scaffolding. Read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally, mirroring the silent crescendo of light.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud ear: varied sentence openings, paragraph breaths match night-run stealth vs. patrol glare. High density—single sentences carry image, backstory, and emotional tilt: “Mara paired teens with grandparents so the walkers would carry not only bread, but stories, instructions, and jokes.” Metaphors stay coherent (bell as bridge rung into air) and physically plausible. One mixed metaphor blip—“sanctions period that blistered everything”—but it does not touch closure. Zero loops, no scaffold, no template cadence; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose density high: single sentences carry metaphor, motion, and causality—“I exhale and the arches thicken.” Rhythm modulates responsively; no algorithmic patterns. Mixed metaphors avoided; cloud-lantern, bloom-comet, river-mouth cohere under soft-physics lyric rule. Minor loop: “breath” repeated ten+ times functions as intentional drum rather than churn, but edges toward monotony; prevents full 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“I kiss the wordless covers and feel their pages begin to disintegrate into birds”). Metaphors stay physically coherent—hyperbolic curves behave like coral, not random magic. Minor template cadence in “and the…” anaphora early on, but pattern is taught and pays off in litany of rooms. No loops or synonym churn in closure beats; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry triple duty—information, atmosphere, emotional charge—without purple drift: “the aurora bled downward and the metal cooled into a listening bowl” marries causality, color, and metaphor in one breath. One template cadence (“while cells divide”) is patterned and purposeful, not artifactual. Minor paraphrase loop mid-paragraph (“absences grow edges, and edges sing…”) but it tightens the conceptual screw rather than stalls. Closure line is clean, no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric metaphor density is high but purposeful—the pattern teaches the reader to read light as ethic. Mixed metaphor check: “cold with oil and stars” is physically coherent. No synonym loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Minor scaffold: two “pressed” in successive clauses at climax; doesn’t touch closure image. Final two sentences achieve crystalline cadence, fulfilling read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: each sentence layers image, metaphor, and motion. Occasional stacked metaphors (“kiln brightened to gout orange… molten mouth”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; information multi-tasks. Minor register elevation (“conceptual repricing”) nudges against POV lexicon but stays within reflective distance. Closure beat is crystalline: “the purpose is to notice what hurts and make space”—concise, propulsive, earned.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyric density high yet purposeful; metaphor chain (library as ship, constellations as lock) remains coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances cipher or emotion. Occasional elevated diction (“testify,” “reknit”) acceptable within stunt-double eloquence register. Final third clean, allowing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: “gold leaf bruising under rain like ripened fruit” does three jobs (tactile, visual, mortality metaphor). No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. One mixed metaphor—“star steadies like a nail”—but fort-as-patient-pupil justifies it. Final paragraph’s cadence slows to mirror sea’s “single muscle,” propelling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty—image plus concept—without scaffold: “the broom does not complain” reveals both tool loyalty and emotional stance. Figurative logic stays coherent: frost as recording medium never contradicts itself. One paraphrase loop (“second chance… chances are more like broom bristles”) is earned by thematic necessity. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often paints scene + emotion + stakes (“I patrol beneath the awnings where the last show shuttered, fingers worrying a lens…”). Figurative language spare, no stacked metaphors dulling closure. Filter verbs minimal; when used (“I see,” “I feel”) they serve registrar’s cataloguing nature. Occasional template cadence (“I tell them… I held the lens…”) but appears in reflective beat, not peak action, so clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, motion, metaphor—without overcrowding: “I trimmed the oldest vine tenderly, accepting the leaves that chose ground.” No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; each figure extends the garden’s logic. Rhythm modulates like breathing; no template cadence. Proof-level clean: pronouns, tense, punctuation immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyric density justifies itself: every figuration advances atmosphere or causality—no purple loops. Mixed metaphors avoided; water-as-mirror, light-as-score stay coherent. One paraphrase loop (“the code says…”) could compress. Final third clean; no artifact touches closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm pulses like submerged waltz.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    High-density lines (“galvanized rooms stitched to stone”) advance both image and affect; varied sentence openers, no filters at climax. One mixed-metaphor risk (“towers with tired knees”) but physical logic holds; no loops, artifacts absent from closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Almost every sentence carries double duty: “Beads of condensation ringed it like a rosary, and grease made the beads shine” fuses image, metaphor, and plot cue in one breath. Metaphors stay coherent—tunnel as cup, valve as lung—without conflicting vehicles. Zero template cadence or synonym loops; openings vary from participial to noun-fronted. Momentum breathes: dense metaphoric blocks alternate with stripped hearing-beats that let pressure settle.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyric density is high but patterned; metaphor strings (“roots write footnotes,” “pollen on forgotten names”) teach their own grammar and avoid clutter at climax. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence layer-adds (sound, smell, tactility). Occasional abstraction (“time forgets its edges”) is earned by surrounding concreteness. Minor register drift into “regenerative silence” as technical coinage is justified by conceptual payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops, high density: one sentence often does three jobs (sets atmosphere, advances beat, reveals interior). Figurative language internally consistent—moon “patient moth,” shadows “paper cuts”—all propelling rather than decorating. Final line cadence mirrors lullaby descent; no artifact near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry high density—each image simultaneouly advances atmosphere, stakes, and tactile detail: e.g., “dust flurries like moths, each wing a different year.” No synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent within their domains (time ↔ wings, axis ↔ fevered child). Register remains elevated-lyric but is motivated by the historian’s archivist-romantic sensibility. Minor overwriting in “bronze quiet that even dust learns to honor” is the only purple moment, but it is pattern-establishing and thus exempt under the overwrite check; it does not obscure causality or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm is oceanic: long swells, then short breakers—“We boiled sugar, inked rice.” No scaffold loops; each line advances image or action. Metaphors stay inside physical logic—light squares on kitchen walls—avoiding purple drift. Only minor register lift: “Conceptual Repricing” is evaluator language, not prose flaw. Final line “see what you have done” is syntactic cliff that lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence music is deliberate but never algorithmic; varied openings, natural breath. Figurative language is sparse, precise: palette “listens,” silence “folded up obedient as clergy robes.” Zero paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Information density high—every line advances ritual, character, or metaphor. One mixed-metaphor risk—“palette like a mouth waiting / like a lake with no exit”—reads intentional, paid off by closure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence advances image, sound, or emotional stake. No loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse under peak pressure, accelerating into the final seam-smile. Occasional elevated diction (“baton of unheard symphonies”) is voice-motivated and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—“velvet hush,” “fossil teeth”—and avoid muddle. High density: “She slipped the repaired needle into her pocket, its new thread humming like a small animal sleeping” performs action, object state, and resonance in one stroke. Opening and closing lines read aloud with natural cadence; no algorithmic patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density—most sentences couple sensory report with causal cue; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: fountain-metronome clicks mirror stealth pacing. Figurative layering is disciplined; vehicles stay meteorological and cohere. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) appears only in narrator’s professional idiom, not intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density—“vial hangs like an unplayed bell” compresses object, sound, absence. No scaffolding loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Mixed metaphors avoided; “feathered vapor” stays consistent with bud / light weave. Minor: “tonight my wares lead me” opener is slightly ornamental before pressure arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “meaning pooled… with passionate subtlety” performs its own claim. Metaphors stay coherent (rope as grammar, mirror as non-glass) and rarely clash. Two adjacent near-repeats (“patterned… pattern”) are the only micro-loop; otherwise rhythm varies. No artifact touches the closure beat; final sentence lands clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm: varied sentence ingress, no template cadence, paragraphs visually breathe. Information density high—each image carries twin duty (e.g., “rusted flanks like hedges” fuses shipwreck with garden). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Figurative language retreats in the climax, letting the tide-click of shell-coin-seed carry the beat—disciplined restraint that magnifies final image.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences perform double duty—each sensory detail simultaneously advances atmosphere and stakes. Rhythm modulates: long inhalations of clauses build, then break into shorter exhalations (“We stood until the light thinned into tea”). No paraphrase loops; every image is fresh. Minor overwrought moments (“honeyed hush pressed between stones”) are justified by the narrator’s vocation as romantic alchemist and do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences deliver broker trait, setting, atmosphere (“salt breezes and the hush of pages”). Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay nautical/musical. No scaffold or synonym loops; occasional adjectival pairs (“cautious exuberance,” “whimsically attentive”) are prompt-mandated and brief. Ear-test shows varied sentence openings and paragraph rhythm; final rope-bookmark image is lean and propulsive. Minor abundance of participial phrases in celebratory rooftop beat, not at closure, so 9+ still within reach.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops; every sentence either advances the search or thickens the crystalline grammar. Metaphors are consistent—orchard as glass organ, crater as singing bowl—and never mixed. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one stroke; final line resolves by re-charging "lean together." Sparse use of "like" keeps similes sharp; no scaffolding or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet buoyant: every clause advances image or consequence—“water shouldered past buttresses” does three jobs. No paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors; stainless-steel vocabulary stays within illustrator’s lexicon. Sentence variety is orchestral, from fragment pulses to sinuous participial chains that mimic canal flow. Final line cadence (“to guide returners”) delivers understated propulsion that reopens rather than closes—perfectly calibrated.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is propulsive yet lyric: each sentence carries dual duty—information and atmosphere—without scaffold. Figurative logic is internally coherent (moon-thread rope, festival-clothes equations) and peaks in the final pendulum image without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; every clause adds new angle or texture. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates with breath-counting drips, then slows on the final carried theorem, mirroring his exit crawl.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Propulsion is high: every sentence advances mapping, memory, or micro-action. Figurative density is deliberate but patterned (tape=nerve, library=body), avoiding random pretty. One scaffold detected—“he had found it months ago” repeated in adjacent sentences—triggers −0.2. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay coherent within building-as-organism logic. Final line crystallizes without overwriting: “etched a small arrow...closed the panel.”

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, metaphoric, and causal work—“the surf whispered names along the shingle, and the brooch glowed among them.” Metaphors are coherent—tides as knives, fog as harbor—no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated register (“unearthed convergence”) is justified by lyric mode and taught early. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new angle or object state.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence length varies from crystalline fragments to winding clauses that echo drip-time. Metaphors stay internally coherent—“choir of rock inhales”—and serve dual duty (sound + body). One paraphrase loop costs −0.2. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long sentences during mist-thinning, staccato ledger notes under pressure. Information density is high—“gulls punctuate them” does three jobs: sensory, musical, spatial. Figurative language is selective; when “balconies were hung with damp laundry” edges toward postcard, it is immediately undercut by the anti-fanfare. No loops or scaffold; the only near-repeat (“staggered intervals”) is purposeful motif-reinforcement, not synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances. Figurative language is restrained until payoff, where metaphor crystallizes closure: “stars bent lower, sealing the place like a sheltering lid.” Information density is extreme—each verb (“unbutton,” “braided,” “yawned”) performs world-building and emotional pivot simultaneously. No artifact touches the final third; the last line is monosyllabic, releasing breath. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates through enjambed clauses, then halts on “I began anew”—a cadence shift that reweights everything prior.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.3)
    High-density lines (“whales rose, leaving spirals of air that matched old ink drawings”) perform triple duty: motion, metaphor, linkage. No synonym loops; each sensory stroke is new. Metaphors are physically coherent—stone ribcage, whale breath as metronome—never mixed. Final paragraph cadence slows to match dawn pallor, creating a paragraph cut that changes emotional charge. Zero scaffolding; no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with storm—long sentences swell, then fracture into fragments as space mutinies. Metaphors are high-wire but coherent: “charged wings” and “spectrum like polished knives” share a physics of light and danger. No loops or scaffold; information density is near-optimal—each sentence layers image and stakes. One mixed vehicle: “spectrum like carefully polished knives” conflates light and blade, but the clash is brief and sharpens rather than dulls.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors are precise—“breathing in the thin pencil-lines between my movements”—and never mixed. High-density doubling: the ink pot is simultaneously heirloom, forgery tool, and legal stamp. Rhythm breathes with escape tempo; no scaffolding even in transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image, action, and metaphor without scaffold. Mixed metaphors are controlled—light as ribbon, halo as windows—sustaining coherent physics of refraction. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses climb, short beats cut like scissors. No loops, no filter stacks; occasional elevated diction (“incandescent restraint”) is voice-motivated and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Density is high: every sentence layers image + motive + world rule (“paperwork moves faster than tides”). Metaphors stay coherent—oily water constellations mirror container walls—no mixed vehicles. Varied sentence openings, paragraph lengths breathe. One minor scaffold: “across the rhythm of tides” repeats four times as litany; while purposeful, the final iteration borders loop artifact, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Information-dense lines carry triple duty: “the sound gathers…turns, and sits down beside him” advances story, character, atmosphere. Figurative logic stays coherent—no mixed metaphors; “tired but merry widow” extends the cello-as-boat image. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new pressure or sensory layer. Final line lands with cadence shift that reprises opening gloomy cheerfulness without recycling phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence propulsion high: "We sent instructions through messages encoded…" packs method, motive, and world-specific noun in one breath. Mixed-metaphor risk ("tide that buys new paint") is justified by sustained monetary-aqueous motif. Minor scaffold: "consultants nodded… said the market was speaking" re-states same beat; −0.2. No loops in closure paragraph; final image crystallises without verbal clutter. Rhythm is read-aloud musical without algorithmic patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tension: longer reflective lines alternate with clipped procedural beats. Figurative density is high but disciplined—metaphors serve perception, not ornament. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold hint—“the space age gives and takes”—is earned meta-comment, not drift.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm mimics rail coupling: long freight-train sentences alternate with single-note fragments (“Metal kisses metal without scream”). Metaphors are coherent—mist as “gauze,” anchor chain as “beads slid along a string”—and never mixed. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory angle or causal data. Only hairline slip: “timbers groaning like a great throat clearing” is mildly stock, but it occurs early and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric density high yet propulsive; each metaphor advances geography or stakes—“mouth that swallowed maps” compresses threat and lure. No synonym loops; sentences vary in length and opening. One mixed metaphor (“veins met veins…applause”) minor amid overall control. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences do double duty (sound, motion, memory) and vary in length; only one soft loop (“each measure…each turn”) but it serves incantatory beat. Metaphors stay coherent—fork as blackbird, town as echo—without purple drift; high density sustains momentum to the quiet final line.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Figurative density is high but patterned: hush as animal, vial as moon, temple as mouth—each returns in closure refrain, avoiding random ornament. No loops or paraphrase; information multi-tasked (“belt spooled transmitter,” “chipped stopper” embeds tool + history). Rhythm breathes with action—caesuras before panic, propulsion in “I pop the vial’s stopper.” Minor register lift “conceptual mathematics” accepted as narrator’s salvage-tech idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lines carry triple duty: “salt turned the locks green and the guards slower” advances plot, paints world, echoes moral corrosion. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphor logic stays consistent (“lighthouse sustains impossibilities the way a jar keeps a firefly”). One mixed metaphor—“lighthouse prison off a jagged reef behind me like a rumor pinned to the horizon”—is earned by lyric mode. Closure image is clean, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.3)
    High information density: one sentence often performs three jobs—atmosphere, backstory, and causality (“That was the first of the resonant awakenings, not bell but reply to being called”). Figurative language is controlled: no mixed metaphors, no stacked modifiers in peak beats. Rhythm accelerates at pruning lesson, then breathes at bead-hanging. Zero loops, zero scaffold, zero filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm varies from long anaphoric breaths to clipped ink-dot beats; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective: “anemones tuck in like closed eyes” sharpens the moment without clutter. No mixed metaphors; salt, rope, and bird motifs stay coherent. Information density high—every sentence advances character, setting, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.0)
    Every sentence carries dual duty (image + causality): ‘digital highways…glare erases chalk’ distills the central paradox in nine words; zero loops, zero mixed metaphor, rhythm modulates from staccato chalk list to the long release of the final flock image.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Every sentence threads multiple jobs—world, metaphor, pressure: "I pricked my finger, dabbed the thread with red, and the candle flame contracted." No scaffold loops; metaphor chains are coherent (needle → star → route → lie). Rhythm modulates from long breathless accumulations to the staccato "doors clicked like teeth." Micro-slip: "starwash" is a nonce coinage that momentarily jars the otherwise antique diction, but its alienness also fits the speculative frame, so deduction is hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from tidal clauses to fragment-lighthouses; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layering is disciplined—rain as type, kestrels as commas—each image advances atmosphere without muddling causality. High-pressure decrypting beat keeps clarity while coral turns in hand, propelling silence into speech.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    High figurative density is pattern-taught and earned; no mixed metaphors blur logic. Sentence variety is musical, paragraph cuts tight. Minor scaffold: “like” similes occasionally cluster (“like fruit baskets,” “like old theater curtains”) but serve POV’s visual mind. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with image-propulsion; zero loops, zero register drift. Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence modulates from hush of dawn to metallic cricket to dusk hush. Sentence openings vary; no template churn. Figurative language is dense but pattern-taught (echo = bird = map) and coherent under acoustic logic; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds sonic or tactile newness. High information density: “pigments trembled into awareness” simultaneously advances solvent action and metaphor. Minor filter verbs (“felt”) are voice-motivated, not clustered in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety propels; high-density lines (“temperature rose until sweat became a second language”) do triple work. No loops or scaffold; metaphor chain (bees/antennae, moths/microphones) stays coherent. One mixed metaphor blip: “thinking storm” is passable. Final line “garden keeps the spark” lands crisp with cadence shift. No artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythmic control matches tidal surge: sentence length swells and ebbs. Information density high—one line often layers sensory, metaphorical, and emotional work. Metaphors stay coherent within brine/reef ecosystem; few mixed-vehicle hazards. Minor scaffold: “via half-sung lullabies…” repeated as refrain; reads as intentional pattern, not loop, because it accumulates choir-like payoff. No artifacts touch closure beat, so 8.3 holds.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and job—"I sweep the aisles with my feather broom, coaxing dust into jars labeled with seasons" advances caretaker ritual, world rule, and sensory texture. Metaphors stay internally coherent (sound = glass, memory = dust) and never collide. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; elevated diction is caretaker-native. Closure line—"whose coins of light pay our debt to the sky"—is crystalline, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences do triple duty (“ink breathing into letters shaped like opened doors”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (glass = held breath = warning). One mixed metaphor only (“braids make strength visible”) but it clears within two lines. Closure line (“dawn uncoupled from the night”) is clean, propulsive, resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level propulsion is high; every line either advances plot or deepens image. Figurative language is patterned and paid off (pollen-dust verdicts, sugar signatures). No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. A single mixed metaphor—“lullaby of patient power”—is mild enough not to dull closure. Read-aloud cadence breathes with the mountain; paragraph cuts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences carry two jobs (image + motion). Metaphors stay coherent—dust as clock, pigeons as hearths—no mixed vehicles. One minor loop: “paper trails braid our days, ledger to margin, feather to fingertip” restates the same braid twice; −0.2. No artifacts touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is highly figured; metaphors are coherent within the fantasy lyric mode, yet density approaches overwriting—four similes within two sentences recur, dulling peak moments. No synonym loops or scaffold sentences, but the clause-stacked lyricism slows propulsion. Final image lands cleanly, so artifact touches atmosphere more than causality.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentence-level propulsion is virtuosic: every line layers image + motion + concept (“moon yards itself through gaps”). No scaffold, no paraphrase loops. Metaphors are risk-dense yet internally coherent (bishop’s diagonal = oblique grief vector). High information density without overwriting; even abstract “serendipity” is grounded in tactile coin circles. Rhythm accelerates into the quiet climax, then exhales—perfect cadence match.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentence carries image, motion, theme (“I am spontaneously anchored… between crest and crash”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors internally consistent (tide/music/ink). Rhythm accelerates at verse-penning then slackens into earned hush. One near-purple line muted by context: “lunar habits honed by centuries of polishing cold light” reads as character-true excess.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Almost every sentence carries double duty: “I polish the harbor windows until they recall the sea that once invented them” fuses action, metaphor, and backstory in one stroke. Minor scaffold: “the day to hold” and “already luminous” echo closely in the penultimate paragraph. Metaphors stay coherent—glass as fish scales, mist as choir—anchored in the glazier’s professional lexicon. The read-aloud rhythm is tidal, with paragraph lengths visually imitating wave sets; only the investor/boat-shed sentence sags slightly under polite abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—porcelain as “small immaculate coffin,” town lights as eyes—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: “paper children breathed their thin, ash-scented breath” carries tactile, olfactory, emotional payload. Read-aloud rhythm varies; final line slows to match star-step calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is oceanic; sentence variety is deliberate, never gimmicky. Information density high—each line does two jobs (e.g., “gut-sealed pig bladders dyed with seaweed ink” = world fact + tactile sight + stakes, since failure wastes foodstuff). No mixed metaphors; “cathedral calm” is earned by prior stone/ecclesiastic imagery. Minor scaffold: “I breathed / I recognized / I stepped” triplet in closing paragraph creates template cadence; not severe enough to dock closure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; almost every sentence layers sensory, metaphoric, and emotional work. Metaphors stay internally coherent—house as shell, negative as eel, silence as pantry—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold loop: “I thought of the mentors again and their diagrams…” is near-paraphrase of earlier beat, costs −0.2. Otherwise zero filter-verb stacks, zero synonym churn. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with discovery beats.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence length and paragraphing echo inhale/exhale cycles. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—every metaphor extends mirrors, water, or heartbeat without mixed collisions. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor scaffold: “they said” attribution x2 could trim, but artifacts never touch the final beat. High information density; each line advances atmosphere or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, creating natural ebb and flow; high information density—each image does double duty (clipboard as archive and wing). Figurative language is selective: “bowl of casings, a bitter bouquet” lands without crowding. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; “ritual significance” recurs with accreting rather than repetitive force. Minor scaffold appears in the anaphoric “we will…” close, but it serves ceremonial cadence rather than padding.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “map drawn by cracks in dried riverbeds” fuses image and function in one stroke. Mixed metaphors are minimal; “corridors need music to stay” is purposeful lyric logic. No scaffold or synonym loops; each sentence adds pattern or pressure. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long desert sweeps to staccato release, supporting momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    Figurative density is high but patterned: “lanterns bled tiny suns,” “breath rose like pale birds” taught in paragraph 1 and echoed in prism’s “hushed rainbows,” so it reads as accumulative texture, not purple. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causation. One mixed-metor risk—“snow sifted like slow fire”—but physical logic holds (cold vs burn of friction). No filter-verb clusters; verbs are strong (“coaxed,” “clicked,” “rang”). Line propulsion carries through final clause “learning slowly how to refuse and still sing,” which acts as both cadence and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is dense yet breathable: metaphor clusters (meteor hush, chalk footprints, moon puddle) recur with accrued meaning rather than decorative overload. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to staccato stage directions, mirroring the shift from reflection to action. One paraphrase loop (“we had to reverse the gravity… we would carry this ethic back”) is forgivable because it functions as deliberate incantation. No mixed metaphors; each image is concrete and trackable.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is dense and musical; figurative layering rarely repeats vehicles. One scaffold loop: “rehearsed loss while rehearsing respiration” is elegant but momentarily stalls momentum. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph’s syntactic hush perfectly mirrors content. Within 9 contention but for that single self-paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is purposeful; sentence length varies with furnace cycle. Figurative language is dense but patterned—vehicles of casting, aurora, breath—never mixed contradictorily. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and technical data. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “the sanctum had its own weave / the furnace bellows...” could compress, but does not obscure causality or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lines are scaffold-free; each sentence advances either schematic process or atmospheric charge. Metaphors are sparse and mechanical—“plaster buckled like a dried river”—never layered into purple. No synonym loops; “wires,” “sums,” “dusk” recur with accretive meaning. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, not expositional, satisfying read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: information density is high—each sentence advances atmosphere or metaphor without scaffold. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; even abstract nouns like “shifting grace” are tethered to sensory ripple. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long liquid clauses to hammer-beat fragments (“She did not”). The only hairline slip is occasional modifier stacking—“machine rows inside him have slowed”—but the image is still legible and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early (“branches arched like ribs”) and paid off at climax, so no penalty. Strong verbs dominate: “sap slurred,” “fruit lifted,” “bell took the ribbon’s color.” Occasional stacked epithets (“lush orchard spanning the rafters”) verge on purple yet serve atmospheric pressure. Zero paraphrase loops, clean grammar, precise spatial tracking.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often layers fruit, memory, and rule. Metaphor vehicles stay consistent—orchard as book, cameo as clock—no mixed logic. Minor scaffold: “brightened disquiet” recurs but is pattern-taught and payoff-charged. Read-aloud rhythm varied; no template cadence in peak beats. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, sentence lengths varied; only minor scaffold (“I walked… I reached… I set…”) in ascent paragraph. Metaphors are interlaced but coherent—botanical, musical, geological—never muddled. Information density high: one clause often layers sensory, emotional, and world data. No loop or register drift touches the closure beat; occasional adjective richness is pattern-motivated, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates with breath-control; sentences carry dual duty (image + motion). Occasional stacked metaphors ("bruise-colored circle of hush") flirt with overwriting but serve atmospheric pressure. No loops/scaffold; pronouns clean. Final line lands with imagistic snap. One hairline slip: "the bay opened into a bruise-colored circle" momentarily confuses scale.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor; figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught—“ braids dark with campus centuries” pays off when knots literally open staircase. Sentence rhythm accelerates with rope-count cadence, then softens. High information density: wax, rope, ledger each perform double duty. Line clarity pristine; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds density—“bloom of hush lifted without rising.” Metaphors stay coherent within sonic physics. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“grazed,” “fizzing”) drive propulsion. One hairline slip: “weather finally named” edges toward abstraction, but immediacy restored next line.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Information-dense lines—“stories snipped by winds that sounded like scissors being cleaned”—do triple duty: atmosphere, sonic specificity, and metaphoric foreshadowing. Rhythm accelerates naturally during prism-trimming beat, then exhales with the beam’s release. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor elevated diction (“near-stone,” “retrocognitively”) is voice-motivated and consistent, never jarring.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty (e.g., “I carried a feather that remembered summers” fuses object, memory, vocation). A few metaphor stacks approach overwriting (“blue blades across the hardened fog”) but pattern is taught early and never obscures causality; no loops or paraphrase clutter the closure beat, and the final line’s monosyllabic click (“I heard my name once”) provides cadence relief.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm mimics fuse burn: longer vegetative clauses then crackling fragments. Metaphors disciplined—moonflowers as “listening mouths” stays vegetal, not mixed. No scaffold/loop; each sentence advances color, route, or character stake. Minor density overload in “salt and powdered petals, ground with mortar and joy” but resolved within two beats and pattern-taught. Proofing clean, tense stable, pronoun track perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is organic; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Figurative density is high but patterned early—coastline topography, star-fed hinges—so it earns its lyric stretch. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. One paraphrase loop: “tide ebbing, tide turning” adjacent to “tidepool…reflective” costs −0.2, but closure image remains lucid.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence, propelling the gravity inversion sequence. Figurative layering is dense but patterned, never muddled at the closure beat. Occasional noun-phrase stacks (“gilded hush blown through its beams like pollen”) risk purple, yet serve the textured aesthetic. No loops, paraphrase churn, or scaffold; pronouns track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between long, gliding cadences (matching gondola drift) and short, crystalline fragments at echo-points—read-aloud ear test passes. Information density high: single sentences layer meteorology, emotion, and metaphor (“storm glass vials freckles with slow, pearly crystals”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors are internally coherent. Opening and final lines act as sonic brackets, recharging “quiet that follows a train whistle’s echo.”

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: “I breathed in the dust of the bridges I had ended, then breathed out names” does triple duty—memory, cost, action. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for star-contemplation, fragments for breath-count drill. One mixed metaphor only—“lighthouse with its lamp hooded”—but it resolves on second read. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase; each sentence advances image or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric density is high yet propulsive; metaphoric layering (“mushrooms pulse like patient lanterns”) never stalls motion. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; each figurative image advances atmosphere or stakes. Sentence variety is wide, breath-mimicking. Minor scaffold: repeated “I [verb]” openings in the climactic sequence could trim for even tighter music.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image, sound, or choice. Metaphors are coherent—tea-like shadows, breathing horn—and never contradict prior physics. Information density is high: “knurling warm from my palm” compresses tactile memory, maternal bequest, and impending use into one clause. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image (“the house exhaled its long-planned mercy”) without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: caesura-rich sentences for orchard hush, staccato clause-chain for climb. Metaphors are internally coherent—stars graft, equations splice, nectar hisses; no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence can splice memory, object, and world-rule. Loops absent; no scaffold phrases. Artifacts zero; even neologisms (“apple stars, quince comets”) obey taught pattern. Closure line “possibility settle into him like a homecoming” lands clean, no overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is rhythmic and compressed: “quiet swollen,” “talc-gray air,” “bridge-like notes stacked.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors are precise and mutually coherent—button sunburst matches bicycle chain scars, dust crescents match fingers. Information density is high; paragraph cut test passed—removing any paragraph would lose either breadcrumb clue or emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but propulsive: “a drift of moths swirled around a maintenance box half swallowed by reeds” does three jobs in twelve words. Figurative layering is controlled; only one mixed metaphor (“stitch poised to draw two torn edges”) grazes overreach. No scaffold loops, no filler stacks. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to staccato closure, supporting momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is dense and musical—sentences do two jobs of atmosphere and causality without scaffold. Occasional stacked modifiers (“softly disciplined corridors of color”) flirt with excess but serve the prism’s physics. No loops, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks. Final third remains clean, allowing the lullaby to land with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, action, and world-rule. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; metaphor stacks (ash like sugar, petals from silence) are patterned early and justified. Information density high: one line can sort seeds, date centuries, and anchor folklore. Register stays inside sorter’s mystic vocation; no academic drift. Minor overgrowth in peak beat (−0.1) but clarity at closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm accelerates into cataract scene, then breathes with water-clock assembly; sentence variance supports urgency. No scaffold loops; each line advances image or causality. Figurative density is high but patterned early ("clock bones," "constellation eyelids") and pays off. Tiny register peek—"conceptual repricing" notionally meta—keeps it from 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors metallurgic process: long furnace exhalations yield to hammer-short clauses at the pour. Figurative language is controlled—one metaphor per beat, each paid off (“golden soot” returns as fused seam). Minor paraphrase loop in “name by name I tested / again and again I tested” costs −0.2, but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Figurative density occasionally flirts with excess (“sun scattered coins of heat that pretended they were just another cloud”), but no mixed metaphors obscure causality; sentence rhythm modulates, information is layered, and zero loops or scaffold appear in the closure third.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety and information density are high; figurative language is patterned (UV confession, cobalt fire) and never clutters peak beats. One scaffold loop: “I brace again” repeats within three lines but serves as proprioceptive echo rather than filler. No mixed metaphors; closure image remains crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is lush yet information-dense: “pigments mixed with river ash and berry salts” does world, scent, and theme in five words. Occasional metaphor stackedness (“waves lift toward absence, as if absence were a harbor”) flirts with purple but stays purposeful under lyric license. No loops, no scaffold; pronouns are clean. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9-band approach; withheld 0.2 for minor cadence echo (“breathe / breath” cluster).

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is taut, high-density; each sentence advances image or stakes; no synonym loops or template cadence; metaphors are cleanly stacked (“dust lift…settle in a new arrangement”); opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motif; minor scaffold in “coins, mouse nests, and roses” list is purposeful and brief.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or atmosphere. Metaphors are precise—cloud sea folds like a book, frost braids day into script—without stacked purple. High information density: “I rolled the platen, and the library creaked as if swallowing a storm” compresses mechanical, emotional, and world response into one line. Final line “all awakenings must rustle, or else drown” is clean propulsion that recharges prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level density is extreme yet legible: “veils of years draped over battered cornices” does triple scene work—visual, temporal, thematic. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Figurative layering peaks at closure but remains coherent: cracked tender shard = broken hope, yet still reflective. Micro-adjustment for one register lift—“Conceptual Repricing” as evaluator paraphrase—does not appear in the prose itself, hence no deduction. Read-aloud ear test passes: varied sentence openings, paragraph breaths align with emotional swells.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (anchors time, advances plot, carries metaphor). Minor paraphrase loop on “mending what isn’t torn” costs −0.3; otherwise no synonym churn or mixed metaphors. Strong verbs (“rivering chord,” “threaded the rafters”) replace modifiers. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are clean. Closure image (“light returned as a pale choir”) is precise and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet lucid: “black with inquiry” twins color and concept in four syllables. One metaphor muddle: “lamp coughing itself out” momentarily anthropomorphizes hardware, but the coughing pays off in the later human cough-memory, so forgiven. Zero loops; no scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with cave hush. Final line is carved clean.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence pegs driftwood, storm, and kinship without scaffolding. Rhythm modulates from long wave-sentences to staccato tool strikes. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. Only micro-loop: “patience” is over-leant on in closing paragraph, a –0.2 touch that keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: cascading anaphora (“The second panel… The third…”) accelerates like brush-dabs, then slows into copper-leaf cadence for autumn reveal. Metaphors are selective, never stacked—max one per high-pressure sentence—avoiding purple overload. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or emotional information. Occasional elevated diction (“nocturne,” “umbral”) is voice-motivated, justified by artist’s trained eye. Closure image is syntactically tidy, ensuring metaphor doesn’t cloud the reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level propulsion is high: “I arrange a new pattern with shells, repeating their absences” does triple work—action, emotion, concept—in twelve words. Occasional stacked metaphors (“eye sunk in cooled lava,” “gavel lifted above sea”) risk purple but are saved by their functional role in escalating the lagoon’s agency. Zero paraphrase loops; each image of black glass recurs with altered stakes. Final line “each breath a restored margin” is a concise, rhythmic closure that reweights earlier margins erased from council minutes.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose density is high: single sentences deliver setting, metaphor, and emotional state—“bobbed like faded thoughts” compresses object, memory, and tone. No scaffold loops; each line advances either plan or image. Metaphors stay physically coherent—lanterns as thoughts, bell as call to accountability—so figurative language sharpens rather than muddles. Rhythm accelerates naturally from solitary ink-grinding to communal sweeping, mirroring the town’s pulse returning.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level propulsion high; nearly every line doubles duty (image + causality: “I shave the wax thread thinner… let it sink… hum the harbor note”). Metaphors stay coherent within lyric physics (“ribbon of dust… arranging themselves like punctuation”). One paraphrase loop detected (“the orchard drops its fruit” repeated with identical syntax) triggers −0.2; not in closure beat, so 9+ allowed elsewhere. Otherwise zero scaffold, strong verbs, audible rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    High-density figurative language is disciplined—each metaphor serves either pressure or transition (e.g., “starlight feeds the leaves” mirrors the vortex feeding the keeper). Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Minor cohesion stretch in “breath hangs like frost-laced bells” but image is legible and propulsive. Closure line is clean, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence performs at least two jobs (“the rope traveled softer than sirens yet farther”). Metaphor density is high but patterned—“braided harps,” “empty lung,” “woven vein”—and culminates in the closure image without muddle. Register stays within the narrator’s lexicon; “isobars,” “dewpoint,” and “ductwork” are accurate. Only a single near-simultaneity (“I hovered…then pulled”) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density lines do triple duty: “the station wake like a patient animal unbending its ribs” advances atmosphere, character, and stakes; no paraphrase loops or template cadence; occasional stacked metaphors (“fossil pollen,” “shore loves storms”) stay coherent because the narrator’s spiritual curiosity justifies the reach; closure image is clean, no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is near immaculate: no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors, high density—each sentence advances atmosphere or archive logic. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one stroke; final line resolves by image that recharges the motif of pollen. Minor register elevation (“mosaicking silence”) is earned by prior pattern. Rhythm breathes with scene needs, accelerating during the queen’s arrival and settling into the seated vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory metaphor, world-rule, and micro-action—“Lio placed the cremation urn fragment on the seam as if patching a nest, and the metal sighed awake.” No scaffold loops; each metaphor extends prior vehicle (ribbon, river, boot) rather than restarting. Occasional elevated diction (“anticipated mysteries”) is licensed by the lyrical register and pays off in final boot post. Read-aloud ear test passes: varied sentence openings, paragraph breathing spaces align with breath-ribbon motif.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density—almost every line couples image with emotional valence; no loops or scaffold. Occasional stacked metaphors (“wicker lid from a sleeping basket of song”) flirt with overwriting but serve voice; no figurative muddle touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “The copper sang faintly, an insect choir corrected by the living stone until pitch met pulse” advances tool, atmosphere, and metaphor in one breath. No synonym loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are clean. Minor overworlding in “brazen calm etched into errands” but cadence justifies the flourish. Closure beat free of figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loop artifacts; high density—one sentence salts rain, rotunda, and ritual critique. Metaphors stay coherent: “bronze quiet” marries metal’s stillness with alloyed resonance; no mixed vehicles. Sentence variety accelerates up spiral, breathes at window. Final line erases footprints, a crisp image that recharges prior dust motif.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm modulates from long clause heaps (seed recipe list) to clipped seed-cracking beats, mirroring task tempo. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or action. Metaphors are coherent within marine lexicon (shell-music, salt gossip). Information density high: “He pulls them out like rotten roots, stacks them into a lattice, and trains morning glory to climb” does three jobs in one line. Zero scaffolding or filter-verb stacks; clarity intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long luminous sentences for wax projections, staccato “we stood inside that glow” for climax beat. Metaphors stay physically coherent—wax river, copper crow—no mixed vehicles. High density: one sentence often couples action + image + emotional valence (“Harbor lay down and let the sand cool her chest, and her ears shaped the air…”). Tiny nudge: rare “the hush here was wild, quick as grassfires” stacks two similes in one clause, but the cadence survives. No scaffold loops, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: every sentence layers image and thought—“echoed silence nested in the seams of the glass” does triple sensory and metaphoric work. Metaphors are coherent within the temporal logic; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates from long hymnal clauses to the staccato of “I turned the page and dated it.” Zero paraphrase loops or filler; even abstractions like “measured mercy” are anchored to the slowed clock. Closure line is crisp and image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “lamps burned with blue patience, each flame leaning toward a board carved into the floor” performs scene-setting, foreshadows lamps’ final bow, and maintains rhythmic propulsion. Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence; metaphor strings serve pattern (weather-chess) rather than overwriting. Zero paraphrase loops; no simultaneity errors. Closing line “carrying play like prayer” offers crisp, earned cadence that recharges prior “sacredly playful” motif without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: spondaic stresses (“crack in the lacquer became a comet”) counterpoint the whispered sibilants of hush. Information density high; single sentences fold metaphor, tool, and memory (“taped shoes skidding in rhythm” implies injury, scarcity, synchronization). One mixed metaphor—“border of notice swelling and thinning”—slightly blurs, but recovers under accumulative lens. No loops or scaffold; final image is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Varied sentence lengths create breath-mimicking cadence; no template runs. Metaphors interlock (ivy-pages, mercury-eyes, storm-breath) without mixed logic. High information density: one sentence often carries sensory, symbolic, and causal payload. Minor scaffold: “seed the mountain with a map” could compress, but does not dull closure beat, keeping below 9.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers image, metaphor, and causal cue (“dust rose as if listening”). Figurative language is patterned early (loom, maze, game) and pays off without muddle. No loops or scaffold; near-zero paraphrase. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” territory in “kernel of time from chaff of regret”—is justified by tutor’s analytical mind and doesn’t obscure closure. Strong sentence variety; paragraph cuts land on image-turns that advance rather than restate.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layering is dense yet each image advances stakes—“echoes made his math true” concretizes the debt dispersion. No mixed metaphors in peak beat. One minor scaffold: “the canyon listened like a judge who had set down the gavel” could trim to “the canyon listened, judge without gavel,” but the image is earned and does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Information density is extreme: one sentence often performs atmosphere, metaphor, and causality (“I solder two final seams… small exclamations the sea cannot dissolve”). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is precise and mutually reinforcing. Read-aloud ear is varied—sentence lengths swell and contract with breath-hold timing. Artifacts are absent; even the alliteration (“promise was light once, now it is lead”) services the lead/light conceptual flip.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dense lines perform triple duty: “the ceiling breathes in mineral syllables” advances atmosphere, stakes, and metaphor simultaneously. No synonym loops or scaffold; each image adds new angle. Mixed metaphor risk avoided—tidal/limestone vocabularies stay coherent. Final third free of overwriting; single breath-curve keeps closure crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences in calm, fragments under pressure (“I hum. The hum is not loud…”). Information dense—single sentence often does scent, metaphor, and因果. Zero loops; no synonym churn. One mixed metaphor patch: “dull knife” freighter vs. “soft compass” petals—quickly re-anchored in scent mechanics, so −0.1. Line-level artifacts never touch closure; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—short pulses during climb onto censer foot, longer clauses crossing flats; no synonym loops; one near-mixed metaphor (“surf rises through stones”) but clarity holds; final line cadence reprises early steam-exhale image with earned restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; figurative language is selective, never clustering in high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs (“storms had planed,” “laughter snagged”) and concrete nouns propel momentum. Minor elevated phrase—“fractured grace is the only style we have left”—reads earned, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: “colors hushed themselves to gray vows” performs double duty—atmosphere + personification of sea. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new physical intel (notch brightness, salt packet fold). Figurative vehicles stay coherent—dock as ledger, flower as key, light as reply. Opening and closing lines mirror without repetition, creating circular cadence. Micro-moves (“I swept the dock”) prevent shrine sentimentality, keeping momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; high density—“petals glimmer where quartz veins surfaced” does three jobs: sight, geology, threshold metaphor. Rhythm breathes: long sentence for creek rise, fragment for click. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay physical. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via tactile compass-weight. No artifact in closure beat; clarity pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Metaphor density is high but patterned early (“palace rafters,” “stars bled like wounds”) so accretive design justifies it. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected; sentence openings vary. A few phrases flirt with overwriting (“lacy menace of power and mercy”) yet remain legible. Closure line is crisp, propulsive, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence openings vary, no template cadence drumming. Mixed metaphors are intentional and coherent—“trout dodging a hook, like calendars in a landslide”—both evoke slipperiness of time. No paraphrase loops; each image adds new pressure or sensory layer. Minor scaffold: “narrative heat” and “distill chaos” appear twice but reframe at closure, so deduction capped at −0.3. Information density high; one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, interiority).

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; metaphors stay internally coherent (water, breath, birth). Information density is high—each sentence handles atmosphere, emotion, and motion simultaneously. Minor tic: two adjacent “like” similes in the opening paragraph slightly bruise originality, but they are pattern-teaching, not filler. Closure line (“We are three”) is spare, perfect, unburdened by adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold or synonym loops; each line either advances the séance or recharges the metaphorical battery. Figurative density is patterned and paid off: the “coastal town” metaphor returns in the final image of extending piers, now charged with the cost of forgiveness. Sentence rhythm accelerates with the metronome, then fractures into white space as the stylus writes—form enacts content. No mixed metaphors; even “dust sang under my shoes” obeys the story’s radio-magic physics.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences do multiple jobs—“I reset the basins and wrote a note” advances plot, signals cost, and prepares closure. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image. Micro-typo-free, strong verbs, no thesaurus-itis. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence can advance atmosphere, tool use, and interior shift (“She clicked it once and the nearest shelf awakened; spores waved, sensors pricked…”). Metaphors are controlled—no mixed vehicles—and rhythm breathes with scene pace. No synonym churn or template cadence. Minor paraphrase loop near “greet movement without mistaking it for invasion” costs −0.3, keeping it from 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often sets scene, advances stakes, and textures atmosphere (“Calls came down the old copper like rain through a colander”). Rhythm breathes with pressure—short pulses during rail arc, longer clauses in calmer beats. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is patterned early (sound = weather) and paid off. Strong verbs dominate, nouns specific (colander, junction, disc). Clause order keeps causality clear; zero grammar slips.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often = sensory anchor + metaphor + causal nudge (“barnacles wrote their blunt alphabets”). Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Two adjacent “where” clauses in final paragraph create mild template cadence—−0.3. Otherwise scaffold-free, no synonym churn. Read-aloud ear test passes; clauses breathe like wave periods. Closure line unsullied by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level density is high: single sentences often couple sensory snap with social calculus—“laughter from the station to the street” compresses redistribution into image. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “a tent being opened” stays within the logistician’s jocular register. One scaffold loop—“return later, return different, return real”—is purposeful pattern, not artifact. Only a trace of template cadence in the triple-rule chalkboard keeps this shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: each sentence layers sensory job plus metaphoric charge without scaffold. Occasional stacked figuratives (“vault of glass strings”) risk purple but payoff in sonic payoff at climax. No synonym loops; pronouns clean; temporal sequence precise. Final line gives resonant image, not explanation. Minor hairline: “weaponed with silence” is arresting yet borderline mannered, not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “constellations as verbs and fields as nouns” does two jobs—world rule and metaphor—in six words. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each figurative burst is anchored to POV lexicon. Tiny register drift into bureaucratic (“addendum,” “manifest”) is justified by station setting. One paraphrase loop (“we are not fate, only neighbors…”) is rhythmically purposeful, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, with anaphora and fragment beats that mimic sign-language pulses; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent within the glass-and-moon schema. One minor scaffold: “joyful sorrow” is abstract shorthand, but it is isolated and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence variety and muscular verbs—“sunlight knifed,” “seeds opened like small eyes”—propel without purple overload. One template cadence risk: three consecutive “I [verb]” opens mid-text, but pattern is broken before closure. No mixed metaphors; vehicles (kiln, river, seed-eyes) cohere. Information density high; every paragraph advances image or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“steel canyons swallowed his voice”—and never stacked. Information density high: one sentence folds maps, crane positions, and memory. Minor scaffold: “corrugations” repeated twice within 3 lines (−0.2); does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, metaphoric, and kinetic data (“He angled it with a patience that felt like silent empathy turned into motion”). Mixed metaphors are controlled—rain “slick as a whispered oath” merges texture and secrecy without contradiction. Rhythm modulates: longer hypotactic lines for stillness, abrupt fragments for shutter clicks. No synonym churn or template cadence; repeated “spiralingly calm” is purposeful motif, not artifact. A single paraphrase loop (“the night bruises easily” echoed as “the night newly complicated by stars”) is minor and functional, not penalized.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentences for mist, clipped fragments for lantern packing. Figurative language is selective—mixed metaphor risk avoided; "needles hold still against all rules" is precise. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym loops. Final line is lean, recharges "cradle" and "listening." One hairline slip: "paper drinks light" is vivid but approached twice; still, density advances atmosphere without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric accumulations crash against single-sentence beats. Information is dense—“ropes unknotted themselves like old grudges being kissed goodbye” does three jobs in eleven words. No synonym churn or template cadence; each metaphor extends prior physical logic. One mixed metaphor hairline: “fog into a staircase” is abstract, but closure re-grounds it via the skiff’s literal ascent. Minor scaffold: “they say” twice about pirate lore could be cut, yet doesn’t dull final image. Closure beat is crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors deliberate and paid off: turbines as clock hands/bones/medic arms create coherent mechanical anatomy. High density: “wet crescent of responsibility, slipping toward redemption” packs dish, guilt, and salvation into one image. Rhythm accelerates during inspector scene, breathes during hush beats. Peach-wood pith “bright as a wound” is precise, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, metaphoric, and causal work. Figurative language is deliberate—humming quartz as throat, lake as stanza—without purple overload. Minor template cadence in “they say the law once read…” is voice-motivated, paid off at closure. Zero paraphrase loops; pronoun and tense control exact.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between furnace-heat spillage and clipped herbals, creating a listenable musicality. A few decorative pairs—“quiet like glass cooling under a patient cloth” followed immediately by “wavering forms”—slightly over-lush the same beat. Information density is high: one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, temperature). No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the triple incantation of “after the phoenix rises” leans toward ritual filler rather than necessary pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    High-density lines—“golden shadows pool along the benches, catching in jars”—do triple sensory work. Zero paraphrase loops; each bell image adds new shoreline memory. Metaphors stay physically coherent: moonlight is “patient,” not emotional. Minor scaffold: “powerfully gentle” repeated twice; doesn’t dull closure but keeps score from 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: one sentence often sets grief craft, location, and emotional state. Metaphors stay coherent—lily petals mapped to unreachable places, no mixed vehicles. Minor loop: “curtains of intention” repeated four times; pattern justified by accumulative design but still draws attention. No typos, tense slips, or scaffold; read-aloud rhythm breathes with projector’s mechanical whirr.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences fuse weather, tool, and philosophy (“We were reverse engineering the city from the wreckage of its bets”). Figurative layering serves accumulative pattern without muddling causality; only minor scaffold is iterative “she taught me” which functions as chorus. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops; final tape-hiss sentence propels closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “Light rained from the rafters, not burning but washing” performs image, cadence, and causality in one stroke. No filter-verb clusters; simultaneous actions are cleanly sequenced. A hairline slip: “tested distance” leans abstract where a kinetic verb could body the shadow, but it does not touch closure. Overall rhythm and specificity satisfy the 9+ quick test threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template drumbeat. High density: one line can anchor atmosphere, advance plot, reveal interior (“I named my motivation aloud…” simultaneously confesses and performs restraint). Metaphors are coherent (mist as counsel, tail as question). One paraphrase loop on “quietly vivid” brochure/tail tip costs −0.1; otherwise zero loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: single sentences layer metaphor, action, and back-cue (“I crack the frosted hourglass against a stone, pour its cold sand into the ring, and plant the ivy cutting in the center”). Rhythm modulates—long breathy clauses for hush, then staccato verbs for ritual. Minor loop: “tremor” appears twice within three lines; not at closure. Metaphors stay coherent (glass as throat, sand as rain) and do not obscure causality. No scaffold or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are dense yet internally coherent (warehouse, costumes, wings) and do not blur causality. A few adjacent abstract nouns (“promises postponed, apologies rehearsed”) flirt with scaffold but compress stakes efficiently. No loops or paraphrase beats obscure the final image; last line lands with musical cadence that recharges thunder motif.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and mythic labour (“the instrument hums in my hands like a hive discovering spring”). Figurative layering is purposeful, not ornamental—each metaphor re-weights the tool’s life. Minor scaffold: “I know then” x2 could be trimmed, but the second instance tightens to irrevocable realisation, so loop does not dull closure. Read-aloud rhythm reliably varies; no template cadence near end.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long breathy units to hammered fragments (“I set the first freight brake”) that mimic brake-release hiss. Information density is high: one sentence often fuses sensory data, metaphor, and causal nudge (“the spores on the rails wink, then travel, because motion is also soil”). One mixed-metaphor risk—“ripples fold where nothing seems to move”—is rescued by the wave-function rule set already established. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; every paragraph advances knowledge, stakes, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence layers metaphor and action—“skiff kisses the mud with the sound of a yawn” does setting, tactile sense, and mood in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with scene tempo. Figurative language is selective, never overwrought; mixed-metaphor risk avoided by staying within maritime textile lexicon (linen, stitch, seam). One clause-borderline: “eddy of silence that follow my ankles” could read as personification overstock, but it immediately earns tactile payoff when the narrator reaches and finds warmth, so artifact does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from sinuous contemplation to clipped shocks, propelling the accumulative design. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—frost, teeth, bolts, breath—teaching the reader early and paying off in the final warmer exhale. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each image adds new pressure. Minor risk: occasional stacked metaphors (“oceanic ghosts”) but none obscure causality or dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary from short percussive beats to long fluid coils, propelling the tide-like cadence. Figurative language is selective: one sustained metaphor of the corridor as spine/river/breath, avoiding mixed-vehicle clutter. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each line adds new sensory or causal information. The final clause “nothing assembled stays assembled if it cannot move” crystallizes the arc without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between tidal long sentences and deliberate fragments; no template cadence survives past line 2. Metaphors (ring as sky, hum as grief) are singular and internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. Information density peaks when one sentence fuses tool, body, and circuit: “She set the glasses… closed the circuit with skin.” Micro-scaffold appears only once—“barefoot and sure” echoes the opening—but occurs after climax, so closure remains untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence variety and sensory economy are strong;只有少数 scaffold phrases (“and the… and the…”) mid-paragraph. Mixed metaphors are controlled—steam/nectar/wet book work. No looped paraphrase or filter-verb stacks. Final third stays clean, allowing high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence music is varied and propulsive—“the ocean lifted its shoulders and settled like a giant animal” delivers image and rhythm without overwriting. Only one paraphrase loop: “quietly talented” appears twice in close proximity; the second could compress. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay consistent to wind, tide, and plant life. Filter verbs are deliberate—“he felt inside his sternum a pearl” keeps the sensation embodied rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work without scaffold. Metaphors stay physically coherent (rust ticking like broken clock). Minor overwriting in “luminescent ache” and “salt-threaded beard,” but cadence supports lyric mode. No loops, no synonym churn; final column-of-light image propels outward.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.0)
    Every sentence performs at least two jobs: “Pipes hissed beneath the aisles where frost furred the brass like patient moss” advances atmosphere, stakes, and tactile logic simultaneously. Figurative language is sparse enough to avoid purple drift, yet each metaphor is non-interchangeable (footage “refused to be clipped” personifies the system’s newfound agency). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. The final line—“The echoing library under snow held its breath with me”—earns its quiet cadence by releasing all prior sonic imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stake. Figurative language is disciplined—“thorns like tiny sundials set to mercy” is precise, never mixed. Information density high: one line can carry site (“glass-domed enclosure”), ethic (“inculcating plants with values”), and plot cue (“people come with knives”). Only hairline slip: occasional stacked adjectives (“honeyed tea,” “velvet bucket”) flirt with purple, but the cadence justifies the risk and never muddies causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    High figurative density is justified because metaphor is the world’s physics; occasional stacked metaphors (“antlers…petals…brow of the harbor”) verge on excess but never break causality or clarity. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or action. Punctuation and tense remain clean; pronoun reference clear despite abstract subject matter. One register wobble: “conceptual repricing” feels academic, but the piece never internalizes that diction.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    High density: “newsprint heiress carrying my father’s old rosewood pen nib” does three jobs—lineage, object, odor. Rhythm varies: spiral cadence mirrors climb; monosyllabic “hush” lands like shutdown. Metaphor coherence intact—lens as held breath, headlines as tides. Zero loops; no synonym churn. Closing line “a small spike” props final image without over-writing.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Density is high—every sentence twins job: “dust paused midair like a constellation choosing where to fall” advances image and stakes. No synonym loops; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (sound, stars, resin). One micro-drift: “soft bruise against the years” edges purple but is saved by tactile specificity. Closure line “the sound thins” is crisp, inverse-crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense but controlled; mixed metaphors (“echoing bowl glazed with breath”) are coherent within the acoustic grotto logic. Occasional overgrowth—“lilac unease, delicate but sure, like dusk deciding”—threatens purple yet stays purposeful to tone. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or social pressure. Filter-verb clusters absent; strong verbs (“licked,” “smudged,” “curled”) keep immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, moral calculus, or ritual step. Figurative language is patterned—ash, steel, bridge, pause—so the lyric surplus feels earned rather than overwritten. Only a single mixed metaphor (“warm coat of frost”) momentarily jars, but it does not touch the closure beat. Rhythm modulates from long incantatory lines to the staccato of naming, mirroring the plaza’s held breath.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or motion. Only minor scaffold: two adjacent “we always” lines could compress. Metaphors stay coherent within synesthetic logic, no mixed vehicles. No loops or filter-verb stacks; nouns and verbs carry weight. Closure line “my heart the sound of home” risks triteness but earns poise via accumulated sensory debt.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level density is high: one sentence often layers sensorium, tool-action, and emotional valence. No synonym churn or template cadence; each metaphor extends the prior (minnows → glass → river). Read-aloud rhythm modulates with heartbeat and breath. Artifacts are absent; the final “brittle brightness” line is clean, uncluttered, and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—pre-surge lull vs. post-surge propulsion. Metaphors (cave as slow animal, throat tunnel) stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. High density: one sentence often layers sensory data, tool action, emotional translation. Minor loop: “remember” stem appears six times—pattern feels intentional but edges close to over-chant.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—one sustained loom metaphor—never obscures causality. High information density: “page becomes a small bridge” does image + plot work. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closure image remains crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density lines carry triple duty: “Snow accepted the work with an artisan’s patience” advances action (code written), atmosphere (still night), metaphor (white as paper). No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new angle—pressure, memory, object shift. Figurative vehicles consistent: fire-map skin, silver hush, steady burn—metaphors extend rather than contradict. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long breath of opening clause vs staccato code instructions; paragraph cuts land on image-turns, never redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: each sentence advances atmosphere or choice; no scaffold. Figurative layering is patterned and paid off—fog as muslin, map as horse—never muddled. Rhythm accelerates with oar-ticks, breathes at seam-tie. Zero loops; noun/verb choices precise (“spindrift,”“palimpsest”) without purple inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density: one sentence does scene-work and metaphor (“the smoke lay down again, taught by the day to flatten”). One scaffold tic: repeated “she… she…” anaphora in exit paragraph; not at closure, so −0.2. No mixed metaphors, strong verbs anchor each paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is supple; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe with scene tempo. Metaphors are sparse, precise: moon “shoals,” lantern “breathes like someone waking.” No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information density is high—one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and causal work. Minor register lift in “congregation of eyes learning to forgive” stays justified by the heightened final beam sweep.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm: long tidal sentences alternate with short stabilizing beats (“I wait”; “I wipe”). Figurative density is high but patterned—mixed metaphors are avoided; vapor, tide, and sound waves share fluid physics. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new tactile data (polished metal, dripping constellations). Information density: a single line (“Their drops sing coordinates; my tongue answers”) simultaneously advances plot, reveals tool use, and embodies cost. Opening line anchors voice and concept; final line resolves by image that recharges “table made from waiting.” One near-scaffold: repeated “the stone circle” three times in 50 words—minor, outside closure, −0.2 accounted for in grade.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence threads action, image, and theme (“I laid thin threads…gentle enough for wary feet”). Metaphors are clean and mutually reinforcing (rain beads as “tiny windows,” bell sound as “thin fish”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; minor over-modification in “dripping and shimmering like a patient lantern” stays within lyric contract.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive—each sentence advances image or stakes (“duct tape spelled warnings” does double world-building work). No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is disciplined to radio or astral lexicon. Opening line anchors voice and premise; closing line recharges the motif charts. One micro cliché (“like sugar into water”) barely nicks perfection. Paragraph cut test passes: every paragraph shifts knowledge or emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere or tactic. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Metaphors (stone lungs, lace of breath) remain coherent and mutually reinforcing. Minor overworld risk in stacked figurative lines, but pattern is taught early and justified by lyric mode; closure image unaffected.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence can body, object, and metaphysics (“I threaded it…wanted to twist back into a bow”). No synonym loops; each metaphor is single-use and physically loyal (ribbon ≠ bridge until final canvas). Two mixed-metaphor risks—“spear of rebar,” “ghost of perfume”—read as character’s synesthetic coping, not overwriting. Final third clean of artifacts; closure image crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    High-density lyric prose; every sentence layers image + motive + world rule. No loops or scaffold; mixed metaphor count is low and patterned (“humidity…kelp…mold”) so forgiven. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with tension. Closure beat “machine wetly shiver” is precise, not purple. Minor filter-verb cluster mid-story keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or paraphrase churn; each sentence advances image, sound, or stakes. Metaphors are precise and non-contradictory: “emulsion peeling like a moon shedding languages” sustains photographic/celestial logic. Sentence variety accelerates with pressure—fragments (“You found the ledger”) under bridge—then exhales into longer harmonics. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by action (“now ours”) that recharges bridge-song motif.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: one sentence often layers map, commerce, and memory. Figurative control is mostly tight; only “ledger of exits, census of places” edges toward stacked metaphors yet remains legible. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary, read-aloud rhythm breathes. Proofing is clean; however, two near-synonyms (“polished calm…perceptively calm”) create micro-redundancy that blunts peak beat, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyric density is high yet purposeful; metaphors (“lines trembling like held confessions”) stay consistent to astronomical/verbal frame. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Rhythm breathes with scene pace—caesuras during star waits, accelerando during read-aloud. Tense, punctuation clean; no simultaneity errors. Final sentence earns cadence without drumbeat. Minor scaffold: occasional stacked adjectives (“midnight hush pooled…”) but never near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: single sentences twin job—map current and reveal character (“circles widen from my raft and touch each spinning tree”). Metaphor layer is high but patterned, coherent (lake as pupil, hooks as crystallized speech), never muddled; no mixed vehicles. Zero loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; noun/verb muscle strong. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via image that recharges “circles widen and stay calm after battle.” Minor compression in “radio hush of words” approaches edge but remains legible under lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose shows high information density: metaphor stacks advance atmosphere while doubling as world-rule exposition. Rhythm modulates from breath-held openings to urgent sentence fragments at maze entrance. Two mixed-metaphor patches (“blue hour would not be unmade”; “sundial agreed to tell time again, sometimes”) mildly blur physical logic. No loops, scaffold, or filler; each sentence adds texture or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene pressure—long sinuous clauses in discovery, staccato fragments at the trade beat. Figurative language is dense but coherent, rooted in market/orchard imagery; no contradictory metaphors. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory cue, world-rule, and emotional tilt. Minor template echo: three consecutive “I…then I” constructions mid-story, but they coincide with causal sequence and do not obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; metaphor density is high but patterned—“rusted thought,” “evaporated applause”—and justified by narrator’s lyric past. No synonym loops or scaffold. Information density strong: one sentence can do description, backstory, and emotional state. Minor mixed metaphor “applause sloshed off the shale like water” barely grazes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors are deliberate and coherent—“arbor is a sentence with quiet conjugation of force”—and never violate internal physics. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges prior motifs. High density: “knowledge fruits are born from resonance, and seeds are the lost chords” does three jobs in nine words.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric density is high yet purposeful; each metaphor extends the tidal clockwork conceit without mixed logic; no synonym loops or filter-verb stacks; final “keep, keep, keep” repetition is earned cadence, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates from longer, image-stacked openings to clipped hinge-click final sentences; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent (cave as listening ear, pearl as seed) and do not collide. Information density is high: “sensors ticked…clicked rude” carries setting, character, and theme in one line. Closure image is uncluttered, free of scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each line advances map, memory, or breath. No loops or synonym churn; “river does what it was asked to do” recurs only to reprice meaning, not to pad. Figurative language is disciplined—ivy “shimmered like soundproofing” stays within physics of light and dampens the accordion’s shy notes. The closing ledger image is crystalline, free of scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty: “Numbers budded from the etched teeth, then letters, then little arrows” seeds both cipher and future action. Figurative layering is dense yet patterned—fog as listening breath, corridor as unwound spring—so the lyric excess feels earned rather than purple. No loops, no scaffold; pronoun and temporal tracking remain clean across shifting scales. Only a single paraphrase flutter (“promise I dared to believe” echoed four lines later) stops this short of the topmost band.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density—most sentences do two jobs (image + causality). A few metaphor stacks (“breath became knives,” “jam-sweet”) flirt with excess but are pattern-taught early and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; closure line is clean. Minor over-writing in “thousand soft eyebrows” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet limpid: one sentence often does three jobs (anchors body, advances ritual, textures world). No loops or synonym churn; “aurora” never repeated carelessly. Mixed metaphors avoided—aurora as cloth, circuit as bruise, silence as tuning—each kept coherent. Minor overwrought line “world shiver near that threshold” but it lands at climax and is earned by prior “threshold” seeding; does not muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally; sentence openings vary. Metaphors are coherent—grotto as throat, clouds as white sea—without mixed clash. No loops or synonym churn. One hedge: “kindly decisive” leans label-adjacent, but immediately embodied via pruning cut. Information density high; every line advances atmosphere or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with ascent: longer wind-filled clauses up the dune, staccato beats at the rail. Metaphors stay mutually coherent (wind-chimes as choir, shard as eyelid) and physically rooted. No paraphrase loops; information dense (“decisions here already carry the sound of aftermath” does two jobs). One mixed-image risk—”cloak of doubt” could tilt symbolism into slogan—but reclaimed by tactile billow at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long sentences for drift, staccato fragments for the stone drop. Figurative language is dense but patterned (“pond…still word of water”) and never muddies causality. One scaffold pair: “we do not starve knowledge…withhold its feast” could compress, yet it occurs early and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long breath-invocations to staccato clicks; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—"time is a spiral winding around bone"—and never muddles causality. One near-purple phrase ("black mirror that knows more of sky") survives because it recharges the final scent-of-lichen echo.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence length flexes with platform sail. High density (“light spills out as if it had been waiting behind me the whole climb”) advances both image and causality. Only minor paraphrase loop in “mist walking…worked badly…mist walking not to skip steps but to feel them” costs −0.3; still sharp enough for closure. Zero filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Information density is high; single sentences perform triple duty: “I carried a hotel skeleton key tag on a cord around my throat, a brass oval stamped with the number that visited my dreams” anchors object, backstory, and motive in 22 words. Metaphors are precise and internally coherent—“meteor hush,” “moonlight nicked by old knives”—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “the corridor that had become stacks” could compress, but it occurs early and doesn’t dull closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts land on image-shifts that recharge momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and varied; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are consistent (amber, fossilized sap, rainbows from dead worlds) and physically coherent. High information density: one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and causality. Minor purple flourish (“black dew of stellar doubt”) but it lands within voice limits and never muddles closure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “Words spilled against the glass and began to crystallize into fine cuts on the darkness” advances action while texturing light. Figurative density is high but patterned—each monster, tide, and star reconfigures the same grief—so no artifact penalty. One scaffold moment—“He remembered how she had walked without turning back, and how silence eroded his marrow”—restates prior knowledge yet supplies the micro-cause for the next naming, hence allowed. Read-aloud rhythm varies from long tidal clauses to the clipped “He named it Shoreless,” propelling the close.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near flawless: each image performs double duty (breathing-through-damp-cloth sea = both sound and impatience). No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops; even lyrical repetitions (counted, then counted again) serve metronomic function. Density is high yet translucent—“threads of seaweed guiding drops in measured ways” compresses tool, ritual, and causality into one clause. Minor rhythmic echo of “he counted, then counted again” is intentional pattern, not artifact, and closure beat is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tension: elongated cadence for drought exposure, staccato for pocketing photos. Figurative language is spare—“patient bones,” “paper ghosts”—and always purposeful. No synonym churn or template cadence; each sentence advances image or stakes. Scaffolding absent; even reflective lines anchor in concrete cues like condensation rings.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud cadence shifts from waterfall rush to ember hush, mirroring scene pulse. Metaphors are stacked but patterned (waterfall moods, starling calligraphy) so density reads as design, not clutter. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new sensory angle or causal cue. Minor tic: “braided” appears three times in first third—accepted under pattern-teach rule; payoff visible when orchard braids frost and blossom at close.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with the arbor: long vowel sentences under calm, clipped fragments under buckle-test. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances tactic or atmosphere. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“breathing cathedral”) and paid off in the final sigh. Zero filter-verb stacks; props track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to short declaratives at climax; figurative language is dense yet purposeful, no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “history rewrites itself” is repeated four times—once too often—slightly dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lines carry triple duty: sensory, metaphoric, causal (“she cupped the seed and felt her own nerves sink beside it”). No loops; each sentence advances image or tactic. Rhythm modulates from elongated brook lines to staccato timer beat. Figurative language stays coherent—no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Only micro-slip: “orthogonal approaches” is slightly jargony but justified by her profession.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level ear is strong—varied sentence lengths, no template cadence—but figurative language is freighted in nearly every sentence (“lanterns in fog,” “mulch against the tunnel ribs”), creating a surplus that occasionally buries propulsion. Mixed metaphors appear: grief “shows up as a man with a wet hat” then “sits and listens,” a personification that collides with the earlier image of grief as atmosphere. The final third keeps its clarity, so 9+ is not disallowed, but the earlier density flirts with overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; high density—“little climates clinking like secret glasses” does three jobs in six words. A few abstract clusters (“address edited out,” “conceptual repricing”) are tolerated because they serve the concept-driven lens. Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Density high: “ashes sighed… exhaling a vow” carries three jobs—sound, motion, intention. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends the alchemical lexicon. One mixed image—“fireflies with broken maps”—momentarily muddles physics but pays off in emotional disorientation. Final third clean; no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propulsion never stalls, and every figurative reach is anchored in ferry life: “constellations scraped our masts” is physically exact. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; each image extends the pattern without blur. The single potential overwrite—“radio crackled like frying rain”—is voice-motivated and brief enough to escape penalty. Line-level control remains flawless through the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, conceptual data without scaffold. Metaphors stay precise (“thread gathered light the way ivy finds corners”). Minor template cadence in “He… then he…” sequences during circling motion, but variance returns before closure. No mixed metaphors or overwriting in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence can map, characterize, and foreshadow (“I feel the cold ring of cause and the chain that holds us here”). Metaphors stay coherent within liquid physics. One mixed image—“petals on a cold machine”—but pays off when aliens unfold exactly that geometry. Minor synonym swirl around “edges” but never clogs closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level density is high—“pinging in the archive like a swallowed star” does image + foreshadowing + emotional charge in one sweep. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary from participial to noun-clause to fragment without drumbeat. Mixed metaphor risk is contained: “aid needles a darker room” keeps physical logic consistent. Final paragraph slows syntax to match the hush, propelling without drag.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances pressure or image. Figurative layering is dense yet precise: “fluorescents slept overhead like seals” compresses atmosphere and stakes. No mixed metaphors; register stays within the narrator’s sensory lexicon. Closure beat is uncluttered, sealing the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variety is symphonic: participial openers, em-dashed appositives, and fragment pulses keep the ear alert. Figurative density is high but patterned—“snow like fine ash,” “ink crawls,” “fake moon”—each vehicle pays off by re-illuminating the shard. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor adds new physical logic. Minor register elevation (“conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated, spoken by the disembodied mentor and justified.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-zero scaffolding; each sentence carries dual duty (action + metaphor, sound + texture). Figurative density is high but patterned—feathered fracture, grammar between wings—teaching the reader how to listen. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay within canyon/bird/weather logic. Final third avoids artifacts; rain’s staccato translates into shelter without overwriting. Minor template cadence in “I translated…into…” repetitions, but it serves accumulative design and does not blur closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm modulates with breath-based cadence that mimics the garden’s inhale/exhale; sentence length varies to avoid drumbeat. Some metaphor density in peak beat—"seedlings stood up like citizens"—but pattern is taught and purposeful. Occasional filter stacks ("I told the tooth… I promised to witness") yet immediacy returns via tactile verbs. No loops or paraphrase artifacts; information is multiplexed without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors musical phrasing—crescendo of stacked images, then release into short declaratives. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends prior vehicle (copper leaves → halos → coins → birds) without contradiction. Information density high: one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and causal load. Minor over-colonization in two lines (“like...like...”) keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths ebb with twilight hush, tighten during jar opening. Information density high—one line often does three jobs: “children skim the casings like shells, and the water tastes faintly of pennies” (world-rule, sensory, moral economy). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing” diction not quite inside courier voice—stops this short of 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm is deliberate music: three-beat anaphora (“where the rot… where the lines…”) mirrors carousel cadence. No loops or synonym churn; “misting hush” and “whispering gleam” reappear only to accrue new weight. Metaphors are coherent—serpent train, lantern of listening—none contradict internal physics. High density: one sentence fuses sanding, singer, bloom. Minor overworld at “constellations stripped of motion” but image justifies itself. Final clause “wore the day” risks poetic overload yet lands because the entire piece has earned the right to couture its machine. No artifacts touch closure; gate to 9+ open but stops just shy of immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; sentence lengths contract during aisle-bend passages, lengthen in reflective lulls. Metaphors (Mandelbrot on napkin, gravity as candle) are precise, not stacked; no mixed-vehicle failures. Information density high—each sentence layers image and concept. Minor scaffold: “I shelve by… I walk to… I write…” template appears thrice; not intrusive enough to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm varies from long wave-sentences to shutter-click fragments; no template cadence. Metaphors (atlases with salt margins, dawn as childhood letter) extend rather than contradict physics. Information density high—“palette bled a dawn of diluted oranges” does triple scene work. No scaffolding loops or synonym churn; even “whispering archipelago” recurs with accrued charge.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent—“mirrors bright as wet teeth” aligns with physical action. High information density: one line often advances atmosphere + motive + stakes. Zero scaffolding or paraphrase loops; final image is crisp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent within brine/orchard lexicon. Minor register lift in “Conceptual Repricing” is earned by prior salt-cider contrast. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long inhalations (“I keep the city from forgetting itself…”) to clipped micro-beats (“I pour, I wait”). No paraphrase loops; each image advances. One mixed metaphor—“corridor like a bruise remembering light”—is forgiveable because it charges the closure image. Density is high: every sentence performs three jobs (image, emotion, concept) without purple swell.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances at least two jobs (scent-release + testimony-feed, jar-reflection + sunrise-return). Metaphors stay internally coherent—“scent like bread learning to rise” marries orchard and kitchen without mixed vehicle collision. Information density peaks in the seed-handling beats, yet clarity survives: “glow shivered… searching for lost stories” compresses animate hunger into one motion. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy is kept through tactile verbs—“tapped,” “tilted,” “clipped”—anchoring abstraction in bone-and-bark action.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near flawless: each metaphor is singular, no mixed vehicles; “patient rainbows,” “sleeping lung” extend imagery without contradiction. Density is high—sentence openings vary, no template cadence; information is braided (knot = breath = memory) so lines perform double duty. Micro-loop only: “hush” is repeated but accrues semantic weight, hence permitted pattern. The closing sentence folds the ladders back into night, a crystalline echo of the opening cathedral, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences fuse job craft, sensory data, and metaphor (“rain eats old limestone like a slow animal with a patient tongue”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors are coherent under the lens of patience and erosion; no mixed vehicles. Minor register lift—“purl,” “bevel”—fits the antiquarian speaker. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One paraphrase ripple: “the parish heard its own forebears purl through the gaps” could compress, but it advances the sonic motif.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is near flawless: each metaphor is also instrument—“capillary in glass” simultaneously describes fracture and vascular leak of memory. No scaffold loops; every sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythmic variation mirrors nitrogen narcosis—dreamy elongation below, staccato tugs on ascent. Only one faint echo of “physics of letting go” edges toward thesis, but it is absorbed into the lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence carries sensory + metaphor + causal nudge (“I bolted the flower press bolt plate onto an old antenna post, a simple act of listening”). Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence. Figurative layering is taught early and paid off, so even density at closure reads as culmination, not clutter. One near-mixed metaphor (“bowl of breath”) but clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid monotony. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent within lyric mode; no mixed metaphors. Information density high: one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and symbolic load. Minor scaffold: “on the X rise” template is deliberate pattern, taught early, so waived. Zero paraphrase loops; pronouns clean. Closure image unmarred by clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence carries double duty—e.g., "the knot failed with a quietly explosive sigh" fuses tactile sound, foreshadowing, and thematic refrain. Metaphors stay coherent within atmospheric physics; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: "like a bead on a rosary" edges toward familiar simile, but it is earned by prior religious hush. No loops or register drift touch the closure beat, satisfying the 9− gate.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Figurative density is high but patterned—fractal arcs, vine/forest echo—taught early and reprised at closure, earning its keep. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Strong verbs (“shivers loose,” “fractures into chalk”) replace modifiers. One register spike—“Conceptual Repricing” lens—but the phrase is the evaluator’s, not the text’s; the line itself uses concrete pulse/promise pairing.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensorium + navigation fact + emotional tint. Metaphors disciplined—no mixed vehicles; “gauze soaked in mint” stays within tactile/light field. Rhythm varies: longer anacrusis for dusk, staccato for chalk numbers. Minor scaffold: two “note” verbs adjacent in log-writing beat (−0.2). No loops or synonym churn; opening and final lines anchor voice and reweight motif. Clean grammar, pronouns, tense.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is high-density yet breathable: “the air rang thin” fuses sensory and spatial data in four words. Mixed metaphors avoided; clock, tide, and mirror vocabularies interlock cleanly. One minor scaffold—“mirrors turned from ice to water to window”—lists states without new pressure, a −0.2 loop. Otherwise rhythm varies, paragraph cuts are surgical, and final line lands with image-propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud ear is musical: alliteration (“bell…braided alarm that braided us”) without purple overload. Information density high—one sentence can deliver setting, emotion, and myth (“orchard planet riddled with floating rock arches”). No paraphrase loops; each chalk instruction adds new tactical detail. Metaphors are internally coherent: bell thread as comet, nebula as lantern in fog. Final line “rain inside our ribs” is precise, not sentimental, and recharges earlier thirst motif.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Figurative density is high but purposeful; every metaphor services the clock/ocean lexicon. No mixed metaphors or contradictory physics. One template cadence risk: repeated “I wound…then…” triple that could read as scaffold, yet it mirrors gear nesting and is justified by voice. Information density strong: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Final line rests hand on machine—quiet, concrete, perfect cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless density: every sentence either advances escape, deepens orchard menace, or recharges the blueprint motif. A single mixed metaphor—“trenches where the ground tried to imitate a river and failed”—barely grazes clarity. No scaffold loops, no filter-verb stacks; final line lands clean and breath-held.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: “barbed tatters, snagging birds and throats of reeds” does three jobs (visual, moral, ecological) in one image. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or charge. Metaphors stay coherent (foam = musical score) and physically viable. Minor elevated diction (“symphonically minded”) is seeded early and earns its keep in closure cadence, so register drift waived. Final third clean of artifacts, closure image pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is rhythmically deliberate; sentence variety sustains trance. Figurative density is high but patterned—moonlight, glass, hush—taught early and reprised at closure, so coherence holds. Minor scaffold: “to incise is to cut light from shadow” defines a term the reader already intuits. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops; information density stays high.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but never purple: one sentence often carries scent, metaphor, and causal cue (“puddles stitched the courtyard like mirrors without frames”). Mixed-metaphor risk (“coral… singing winter”) is justified by surreal premise taught in same sentence. Zero template cadence; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Only minor scaffold: “I tasted, and the first spoon…” could trim the echoic “I tasted,” but the beat is pivotal and rhythmically intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “She ties it to a length of silken rope used for staging banners” simultaneously moves plot, reveals resourcefulness, and foreshadows communal staging. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors, no filler filters. Occasional alliterative clusters (“gravelled rain,” “patient knuckles”) serve sonic choreography rather than ornament. Zero loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances bridge-building or voice-rehabilitation. The final exhale “that tastes like rye” is a sensory payoff planted by earlier grain references—tight, inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative layering is high but purposeful—mirror as “wounded compass,” canyon as “lung relearning breath”—and never muddies causality. Rhythm accelerates with the quake, then exhales into the final line. No filter-verb stacks; verbs stay muscular (“tilted,” “etched,” “braided,” “tucked”).

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between elongated pollen-sentences and clipped imperatives (“So I slow…”) that mirror the tilted gravity. Only minor loop: two adjacent “refuse” anaphora, but it serves the beat’s ritual cadence. Figurative density stays coherent—no mixed vehicles—propelling rather than stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lines are dense, rhythmic, mostly propulsive; occasional metaphor stacking (“orange hush,” “magnetic nexus heartbeat”) flirts with overwrite but stays within pattern. No loops, clean grammar; final image lands clear.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is dense yet airy: “a sky of rubbed graphite” does triple duty—color, texture, sonic possibility. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative layering is high but patterned early (“sound is touch”) so closure remains clear. The single micro-flaw: “theatrical sincerity” is told; a 0.2 nudge keeps the score below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is almost loop-free; only tiny scaffold (“I journalize...I journalize...”) recycles stem but serves as mantra and is paid off. Metaphors stay coherent (rot=road, bridges=breath) and never crowd a single sentence. Information density high: one sentence often handles scent, ritual action, and social reaction. A single mixed vehicle—“village inhaled wrong”—is permitted because it is later literalized by the stink ritual. Final paragraph cadence slows into long sentence that mimics exhalation—line-level craft actively collaborates in the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: high information density, zero paraphrase loops, metaphors cohere (waterways, resin spindle, resin threads). One micro-slip: “rain promised but not yet paid” edges toward personification convenience, but the mercantile frame fits the planet’s barter logic. Rhythm accelerates into the spindle release, then exhales with the landing—no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, metaphoric charge, causal push—“colors folded inward as if the sky were a lung exhaling.” Zero paraphrase loops; each image compounds prior pressure. Minor register lift (“mineral grace”) stays within POV’s numinous lexicon. One mixed metaphor skim: “architecture rearranged like a flock” −0.1, but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies from compressed fragments to rolling anaphora, mirroring loom-shuttle motion. Figurative language is dense yet coherent: no mixed metaphors, vehicles obey stone-and-wind physics. High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and causal work. Minor scaffold: “like” similes occasionally cluster; none obscure closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive: every image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors. Sentence variety toggles between long breath units and staccato observations that mimic tuning-fork vibration. Occasional elevated diction (“corridor,” “timbre”) is earned by the courier’s mentor-trained perception; register remains internally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies from crystalline fragments to longer, breath-aligned cadences that mimic mist drift. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, atmosphere, or micro-choice. Figurative layers are disciplined—mixed metaphors are avoided even when stacking "veined minerals," "shy fish" colors, and "trembling music." The single lapse is "truthful lies" echoed twice in close proximity, a minor register repetition that does not obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm is loom-like: long warp sentences interrupted by weft-beat fragments; no two openings repeat. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor (raveling silence, attic thunder) advances atmosphere or stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. One tiny scaffold: “the way light leaps but words cannot” is almost aphoristic, but it is earned by prior textile physics. Closure line breathes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long cadences for exposition, staccato prepositional chains during wind. Information density high—“hammering more hope than iron” does two jobs in five words. One template cadence run (“the arches… the orchards… the stone…”) is pattern-taught early and serves chant-like cohesion, forgiven. No mixed metaphors; azure defiance stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, incantatory; sentence length modulates to mirror tidal rhythm of parallel shifts. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends the sensory map (“smell of metal and rain” becomes unit of weight). High information density: one sentence often layers scent, memory, and world-rule. Micro-slip: “redirect” used 10×; intentional refrain but borders template cadence—doesn’t dull closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Metaphor density is high yet patterned early (“room remembered every shipwreck”) so it reads as taught lyric, not clutter. Only two paraphrase loops (“weather and balm, and sometimes both”; “safety is not the absence of loss…”)—minor, not closure-touching. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm serve emotional cadence; no scaffolding or synonym churn. Prop tracking (glass, stones, letters) stays exact.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm built on anaphora (“I tell,” “we burn,” “the storm laughs”) that accelerates like light down the spine. Metaphors stay physical—light as bell, laughter as ballast—no mixed vehicle collisions. Occasional stacked modifiers (“shadowed elation,” “weathered joy”) verge on ornament but pattern-teach the tone. No loops or scaffold in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Information density is high: one sentence often layers dye chemistry, heart memory, and social physics. Metaphors stay mutually reinforcing—light as river, cloth as century-old rain—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “quietly explosive beacon” risks oxymoron, but the internal contradiction mirrors the protagonist’s restraint/force duality and is earned. No loops or synonym churn; each recurrence (wing, sun-river, indigo steam) accrues new functional weight rather than repeating decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence muscle is exceptional: high density, triple-duty lines (“seeds winked approval, ferrying me toward the nursery”). Metaphors are internally coherent (alchemy ≡ memory distillation) and never mixed. One scaffold flicker: “bound release” is repeated concept-label; still, it accrues new tonal layers each time. No loops or synonym churn; no figurative muddle in climax. Minor participle opener cluster mid-story keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Rhythm modulates with pressure: accumulative sibilance in corridor description yields to clipped “We did not apologize first.” No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay physical (map lied, spine uncreased). Information density high—single sentence often carries setting, metaphor, and emotional turn. Zero loops or scaffold; opening “crumpled invitation” re-circulates as passport and mirror of uncreased spine.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphor vehicles (bread remembering heat, room unbending) remain internally consistent. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor—“line thrown from shore” beside “guerrilla gardening”—is minor enough not to dull closure. Strong verb choice—“uncloak,” “garden,” “sweep”—propels without adverb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    High figurative density risks purple fatigue, but metaphor chains obey consistent physics (light, frost, breath) and never stall causality. Occasional noun-phrase stacks (“filaments of vows,” “irridial sheen”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the spectral texture. Zero loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; sentence rhythm modulates with lantern pulses. Closure image remains clear despite lyrical compression.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences layer scent, sound, and motion in one stroke: “salt and rot and lullaby” under bare feet. Metaphors are precise—lantern nerves, listening shawl, moons of limes—and never mixed. Information density is high; every clause advances stakes or texture. No scaffold loops, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks. The final third keeps propulsion: “gray seam opened above the river” recharges earlier planks. A single near-repeat of “comforting unease” is the only micro-loop, too minor to touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the pier, accelerating through thwart and spill, then resting into the hush’s quiet return.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pulse—short bursts under static pops, longer lyric coils during ballot-count. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“taste of…”) is motif-driven, not artifact. Final third is clean; no scaffold dulls the closing cadence. High density: single lines couple meteorology, politics, and emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence often sketches setting, backstory, and emotional temperature (“We meant to rectify the wrong the world did to strange makers…”). Metaphors are coherent—lock as clenched jaw, crystals as frozen dawn—and never mixed. Minor template cadence in the triple use of “after the last echo of laughter fades” costs −0.2. No loops or scaffold in peak beats; closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often embeds metaphor, world-rule, and emotional tilt—“leaves drink the candid and curl from the false.” No synonym churn or template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent (lung/breath, punctuation/condensate). Final line “we measured survival together in truths” is crisp, propulsive, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from short percussive strikes to long resonant clauses; no scaffold or synonym loops. Metaphors are integrated—“bluff whispered like a sleeping throat”—without purple swell. Information density high: one line can anchor time, body, and tool. Closing line recharges “tuned day” without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory, metaphoric, and causal (“The lock sighed open, not broken but convinced”). Figurative language is selective, never clustered in high-pressure beats. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances the communal metronome. Opening and closing lines book-end with the locket, creating purposeful ring structure without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, emotion, world-rule—without scaffold: “the sand here has hardened into plates, buckled by those same invisible tides” conveys setting, cause, and stakes in one breath. Metaphors stay internally coherent (lantern flame inside lungs, gravity as barefoot intruder) and never stack into purple density. One paraphrase loop—“lanterns along the dock shiver / the nearby pocket of gravity opens like an unscheduled mouth”—is forgivable at climax. No filter-verb stacks, no register drift; copy-clean except for intentional lyric fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Almost every sentence layers image, action, and concept (“foam rose and bowed, carrying away a letter here, a digit there”). One near-loop—“smoothed hush deepened like velvet riverbed, an understory where even rumors slept”—is forgiven because the cadence teaches the hush-texture required at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose density is high—most lines fuse image, motion, and concept without scaffolding. Metaphors stay internally consistent (sea-to-archive pipeline) and avoid muddled vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm breaths with scene tempo: languid loops for dusk, crisp stop at “I stood, dizzy.” No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new pressure or sensory angle. Minor overwriting: “tragically radiant sky” and “ghostly resolve” edge purple, but the pattern teaches the heightened register early, so the effect reads intentional rather than accidental. Closure line is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyric density is high yet each metaphor does double duty: “silver rope” is simultaneously sound-cord and debt-line. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops; clauses stay sequential and tactile. Minor near-repeat—“knot” over-loved—but not in closure beat, so caps at 8.3 not 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose density is high—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or causation without scaffold. Figurative language is selective and coherent: “cabins gape like pulled teeth” fits the narrator’s dental awareness of metal and bone. Rhythm modulates from the metronomic taps to the final stuck crank, mirroring the story’s cadence shift. Zero loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift; the closing “then rest” lands with surgical economy.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with task beats: long sentence for net-mending, staccato for firefly flicker. Figurative language is patterned (water threads, lantern throats) and paid off in bowl galaxy—no mixed-metaphor clutter. One paraphrase loop (“swells, collapses, and swells again”) is purposefully tidal, not artifact. High information density: single sentence often layers tool, body, and philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is dense yet propulsive: “logs were gone, but absence is a kind of presence” compresses mystery and method in one stroke. Figurative layer is controlled—never more than one image per high-pressure sentence—so metaphors sharpen rather than clutter. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new information or tactile detail. Micro-slips: “like stubborn lanterns refusing to extinguish” edges toward stacked comparison, but the physicality of sagging fruit keeps it grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; paragraph lengths breathe with scene tide. Information density high—single sentences do triple duty (e.g., “I corked it by reflex and held the glass to the light, and the light trembled as if reading a diary”). No mixed metaphors; salt/tea/iron cohere within coastal logic. Minor scaffold: “I remembered” opens reflective block yet anchors in present stimulus (broken drawer). No synonym churn; “jar” and “note” accrue rather than repeat. Closure image unobscured.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise—sound-catcher trading bottled echoes for meals—feels fresh, not derivative. Transformation test fails if poet swapped to generic bard; jar-museum and widow-box duet are particular. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off: final open-window silence reverses hoarding pattern. Synthesis of grief, circuitry, and communal listening is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. No close echo of famous scene; specificity anchors universals.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “key’s cold teeth taste his palm” does sensory plus metaphor plus plot in one stroke. No loops or paraphrase; each sentence advances. Figurative control maintained even at closure—beam as reset rib—without mixed metaphor. Minor scaffold: “like shy animals” and “like a curious dog” both animalize ice; does not dull image but keeps cap at 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “Pebbles stuck to its rails as if they remembered the mountain” layers sensory fact with geologic memory. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends prior physics (“ironstone spine crossing the valley and humming like a struck harp”). Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. One mixed metaphor—“patience from impatience, chipping at the block”—is minor against the density gain. Closure line “our patient revolution stood” is crisp, uncluttered, and propulsive, sealing the read-aloud cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density—single sentences do setting, metaphor, and interiority (“Salt had crusted… afterimage of the long summer”). No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Minor scaffold: “drought’s habits linger in machinery, like a body forgetting how to drink” could compress, but does not obscure causality or dull closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure; final line offers cadence release.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent—“gears set like teeth in an uncertain smile”—and do not collide. Information density high: “velvet lining cradling a clockwork heart that would not wind” does three jobs in eleven words. Zero artifacts in final third; closure image pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Almost every line performs double duty: “cart skimmed the steam like a gull mocking gravity” advances action, reveals character, and textures world. Metaphors interlock without muddle: fumes/acid/steam/kettle form coherent thermal field. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Minor scaffold: “Click by click, the images said move, then wait, then ache” repeats cadence for ritual effect but risks template; still advances code logic so artifact stays sub-critical. Closing grease-pencil scrawl gives tactile exit.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    High density—each sentence advances plot or metaphor; minimal scaffolding. Occasional poetic overlap (“sensed absence threaded through everything” appears twice in variant) and one mixed metaphor (“silence shaped like a missing person”) slightly bruise clarity, but none touch closure. Strong verb choices, no filter clumps.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—short clauses during nod, expansive during mirror assembly. Information density high: “shard catching lost angles from glass that had watched a hundred unspoken bargains” does three jobs. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; only one paraphrase loop (“not together and not apart”) that serves cadence. Closure image pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.8)
    High-density agrarian diction with rhythmic variety; occasional elevated latinate pairs (“intersubjective understanding”) flirt with register drift but stay within the sentinel’s self-aware lexicon. No loops or metaphor muddle near closure; prop tracking is immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lyrically dense yet propulsive; figurative layering (wind wants to steal syllables) is patterned early and paid off. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One minor scaffold: “the sand’s underbody lies the kinetic parapet beneath the dunes” could trim to “beneath the dunes lies the kinetic parapet,” but the inversion is voice-motivated. Closure image is uncluttered, ensuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates from long breath-piece sentences to clipped imperative beats (“We test the route…”) without mechanical pattern; figurative layering is dense but purposeful, each metaphor (bees as punctuation, vines as climbing ideas) services the accumulative design—no mixed vehicles, no loops, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density—every sentence layers sensory, conceptual, and emotional work; no paraphrase loops. Figurative risk is high but justified: “language climbed into the rafters” pays off at closure. One mixed metaphor (“river reversing under ice”) is momentarily strained yet forgivable under lyric license. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence. Proof clean.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each image carries unique cargo—“filament humming between ribs,” “laughter wearing a limp.” High density achieved via hyphenated compounds that compress two jobs into one modifier. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay within the marine/auditory register. The closure beat—“salt-thread pulling from him like a tide”—is clean, literal enough to maintain clarity while remaining sensuously metaphoric, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “I loosened the mounting collar, a quarter turn, and the image… clicked into a sharpness that hurt” does triple duty—action, result, sensation. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances bearing or bearing-feeling. One hairline slip—“pale claws across the sea” edges toward ornament—does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: every sentence advances image, character, or beat; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is spare—three extended metaphors total—and each pays off (clouds as slow animals → final river finding sea). Rhythm accelerates during the phone call, then lengthens into the dying cadence, supporting breath logic. One mixed vehicle: “weather still clinging to his jacket” is cliché-adjacent amid otherwise fresh phrasing, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near flawless: information-dense, zero paraphrase loops, metaphors stay physically coherent. Only hairline slip is occasional stacked modifiers (“narrow corridor for a disciplined question”) that momentarily stall airflow, but they occur in low-pressure transition, not peak beats. Sentence music is deliberate, each noun chosen to taste or sound (“fork-born thunder”). Closure line breathes cleanly, no artifact touches the final ribbon image.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breatheable; each sentence layers image + emotion + forward motion (“I set more wrists than clocks”). Figurative language is selective, no mixed metaphors in peak beat. Only minor loop: “mistakes into constellations” phrase repeated twice without fresh inflection second time. Otherwise zero scaffold, clean grammar, sharp paragraph cuts.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors stay physically coherent—glass “listens,” mist “folds like milk into tea”—without mixed vehicle crashes. High information density: one sentence can layer tactile motion, memory shard, and ethical stake. Rhythm breathes with physical effort; no filter-verb stacks dull the rasp.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long, honeyed clauses to cracked-joint brevity at burial. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent within moss-tech fusion. Single near-miss: “quiet like tea” is almost cliché but saved by its function as lidocaine for the next line’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty—description plus stakes: “the chill articulate around my knees” advances both body and decision. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends the water/ink nexus. One near-purple phrase—“bee bright” note—survives because the pattern teaches synesthetic color earlier. Closure line “I wrote them as they wanted to live” is lean, propulsive, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Metaphors are selective, never piled in high-pressure beats—only two per sentence max during starlight leak, which is pattern-taught and paid off. Information density high: one sentence can locate the crater, establish compass failure, and braid memory into present tactility. Minor scaffold: “heartbeat a coordinate” echoes twice in adjacent lines; not enough to dull closure but keeps this just under 9+ perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear is musical yet propulsive; metaphor density serves pattern, never stalls. No synonym loops or template cadence. Clause architecture varies: “He machined replacements...feeding filings to a jar like powder from moons” packs triple duty—action, simile, foreshadow. Zero artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Figurative density is high yet purposeful; each metaphor extends the whalebone/scale/coin motif, avoiding purple overload. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentences vary in length and opening. Information density excellent—one line often does image, emotion, and concept. Minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction nudges academic, but occurs in narrator’s reflective beat, not peak action, so clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud cadence is deliberate, but metaphor density nears the ceiling; “rain freckles…silver music” and “little lenses” within four lines flirt with overwriting. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed vehicles; compression stays information-rich. The final third is clean, allowing the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    High-density lines multitask: “turbine becomes a kettle; hinge becomes a book's quiet vertebra” propels both image and theme. Figurative layering is deliberate, patterned, never purple; mixed metaphor vigil passed. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; sentence openings vary. Micro-typo: “seamed with green” should probably be “seamed in green,” a hairline slip that does not occlude closure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.1)
    Compression high—“rainwater pooled in a ballroom where passengers once queued” does triple sensory + history + problem. No scaffold; each sentence adds system detail or micro-choice. Metaphor disciplined: “threadbare lines like lifelines” keeps textile scope. Terminal breathes / I breathed back—mirrored close that re-uses respiration motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Metaphors are coherent—crystal veins carrying “news by ants” maintains scale logic. No scaffolding; “excruciatingly gentle” appears once and is enacted barefoot. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long breath of opening to clipped “He did not wind anything,” mirroring internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Metaphors are dense but patterned (“parchment ribbon,” “lantern glass polished by rain”) and repay in closure when the same water polishes the city’s reflection. No synonym loops; each sensory stroke advances hook, box, or complicity. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“grating complaint”) momentarily lifts above the vernacular, yet the cadence justifies the ceremonial reveal. Final third stays artifact-free, protecting 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, knowledge, or pressure. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—lightning-made root, dock ticking—never crowding high-pressure beats. Strong verbs (“coax,” “yield,” “breathe”) carry weight; no weak modifiers stuffed in. Sensory nouns are specific (kelp, husk, lantern-cupped) not catalogued. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “golden” and “keeping.” Proofreading clean: no typos, pronoun drift, or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Almost every sentence performs triple duty (image, emotion, concept) without scaffold; only a faint perfume of metaphor density in the fountain paragraph nudges toward purple, but the logic of “bruise themselves fragrant” holds botanically and emotionally, so clarity at closure remains unbreached and the ear stays pleased.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses world-fact + metaphor + emotional valence (“palace rattled with hunger, as if craving the wingbeat it once overlooked”). Rhythm modulates—long breathless accumulations crash into short staccato at hatch moment. Metaphors stay coherent within airborne/avian register; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: two adjective pairs “triumphant and wrong,” “bitterly sweet” feel template-adjacent but occur early, don’t obscure closure. Final line “gears learned to hesitate” lands clean cadence that recharges motif.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density—each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, causal work without scaffold. Figurative language is disciplined: volcanic glass = pupil, gulls = runes, yet metaphors stay physically coherent. No loops or synonym churn; varied sentence openings create tidal rhythm. Minor elevated diction (“pale runes”) is POV-consistent and does not blur peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are coherent—“colors trod the ground like barefoot children”—and physically tracked. No filter-verb stacks; agency stays in strong verbs (“angled the box,” “spoke the woman’s name”). Rhythm modulates from breathless list to final declarative cadence, mirroring the breadcrumbed light-steps.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to clipped “Count the sounds.” Figurative density is high but serves the accumulative design; no mixed metaphors obstruct causality. Occasional near-repetition (“troubling serenity” twice) is intentional motif reinforcement. Zero scaffold or filter-verb stacks; closure image remains clear.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cosmic horticulture is familiar sf territory, yet the inversion—cool light as anti-flame—feels freshly synthesized through tactile garden labor. Risk-taking in lyric ellipsis pays off because pattern is taught early and closure legible. Specificity of brass gear and sonar botany prevents generic overlay. Not quite a 9 because premise remains recognizable beneath the ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence advances image or choice; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (glass = tide, butterflies = commas) without contradiction. Minor scaffold: “I am a thoughtful gravestone carver” could be shown faster, but interiority deepens immediately. No artifacts in closure beat; final kite-curve line is clean, rhythmic, legible under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor; figurative density is disciplined—each image carries causal weight (“plank of silence laid across the century”); information-dense lines advance both atmosphere and stakes, climax line “the bells ring not triumph but invitation” propels closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet limpid: each sentence advances image or stakes (“coins worn smooth, a glass needle, and scraps of thread that drink the lamplight”). Figurative layering is purposeful—echoes as birds, knots as punctuation—never crowding causality. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; opening and closing lines book-end with velvet/cobalt motifs. A single mixed metaphor (“velvet unwinding from a well-kept secret”) is allowable at this register and does not dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: single sentences fuse world, body, and concept—“tiles, threads, and glass beads of probability.” Metaphors are selective, not stacked; each returns transformed (beads → constellations). No loops or scaffold; paragraph cut test passed. Only micro-slip: “rehearsing thaw” is slightly strained verb choice, but clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence layers metaphor atop function—ash both medium and motif, radio both heater and stage. Figurative language is disciplined; no mixed metaphors or overwritten stacks impair closure. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—hissing radio, snowfall pauses. Minor template cadence in “They wrote…” anaphora is purposeful, replicating score repetition. No scaffolding, synonym loops, or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “I grind the envelopes, and memory sighs up as paper dust” does three jobs—action, sensory, metaphor—in twelve words. Rhythm modulates from long breathy lines that mimic rocking motion to staccato scatter-commands (“finger, and brush”) under peak pressure. No loops or scaffold; every paragraph either advances the installation or deepens the emotional ledger. One near-muddle: “the verse broke” is abstract, but it is immediately anchored by the literal creak of the chair, so clarity recovers inside the same sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; most sentences twin job: “Yesterday the dredgers found a seafarer’s chronometer cog lodged in a mussel shelf like a gold tooth in a cracked jaw” delivers world-fact, sensory snap, and metaphoric reverb in one strike. Rhythm varies; paragraph breaks land on hinge images. One microscopic stumble: “the reflex to agonize over the least harmful lie to tell” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, but the next clause snaps back to physical imperative. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops; closure line is clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to the staccato of “Rafi caught it, then offered…” mirroring musical phrasing. Figurative density is high but patterned—rosette as sun, compass, coin, bird—each reprise reweights meaning without mixed-metaphor collision. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or beat. A single over-ripe phrase (“injuries too old for their years”) barely grazes the closure beat and does not obscure it.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety is musical—participle openers, em-dashed interruptions, single-word beats—yet causality stays lucid. Figurative density is high but purposeful; every metaphor (planets falling into geometry, seed smooth as polished thought) reappears reweighted at closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed vehicle: “boot prints blooming with rust” stretches bloom semantics, but the image is brief and doesn’t tangle the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence lengths swell and contract with lightning’s intake. Metaphors are coherent—honey, bees, thunder form one ecosystem—and never contradict physics. Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. “Lacquer whispering” is the sole risked personification, but it earns its place by priming the box’s later song.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density lines (“bay pulled light from the sky as if drawing a thread through a needle’s amber eye”) do double duty. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphors stay internally consistent. One mixed metaphor (“quiet lightning” for crack) is hairline. Closure image is crisp. No line artifacts obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; every sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors are coherent water-stone-glass system, no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short beats when threading, expansive when time pours wide. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks; high information density throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high—almost every sentence carries metaphor—but pattern is consistent with obsessive narrator, so tolerated. Mixed metaphors rare; one slip: “light pours sideways, pouring not illumination but contour” edges on excess. Rhythm modulates with breath units; paragraphing tracks beats. Minor scaffold: repeated “I climb… I proof…” stems, but not intrusive at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose carries high sensory density without clogging momentum—“glass panes filmed with the slow exhale of the smog-choked city” performs setting, tone, and stakes in one sweep. Sentence rhythm varies: cumulative clauses build breath-length, then cut to fragment at climax. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each image extends the saffron/moon/seed motif without repetition. Dialogue-free design avoids tag clutter, letting imagery propel the accumulative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: “We stacked loaves shaped like A for Arkady… eaten, crumbs sprinkled into wax molds” compresses ritual, name, and material transfer in one breath. Mixed metaphors (“nectar armor,” “historical seams”) stay coherent within bee/honey rule-set. Zero loops; no scaffold. One hairline slip—“history tug like a hive-slick rope” edges purple but earns its visceral snap at peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; metaphor density is high but patterned (clock/sea) and never muddies causality. No loops or scaffold. Information dual-loads: “stones…sweated salt and secrets” advances both setting and theme. The final clause “unbroken tide” lands clean without figurative overload.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    Metaphor density is high but patterned early (“lingering luminance,” “dead whale nursing a glow”), justifying lyrical excess. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds sensory or causal information. Mixed metaphors risk occlusion—“voice like carnival bark peeled wrong” is borderline—but clarity survives. Information density strong; opening line anchors stakes (“smelled like rain rolled in mothballs and gasoline”).

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm modulates naturally from long breathes of description to staccato strike sequences, matching the storm’s surge. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful: each metaphor extends the acoustic premise; no mixed vehicles break physical logic. Occasional scaffold—“I dubbed… I dubbed…”—is minimal and pattern-taught, so momentum never stalls. A single paraphrase loop (“the music gathered ruin and returned it as push”) slightly dulls the climax, holding the score just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: every sentence advances map, body, or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, never stacked; “sound like sand poured over bone” anchors tone then exits. No loops, no scaffold, no synonym churn. Minor alliteration drift in “sunwashed dread” line but it’s earned by prior sensory setup and doesn’t blur causality.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—every sentence layers archive detail with moral tilt. Figurative language is selective: "ivy whispering memory," "station a long throat," each image fresh and non-contradictory. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; sentence openings vary. One near-scaffold: "I answer myself with steadiness" abstracts a beat that could have been dramatized, but the line is brief and offset by surrounding concretion. Grammar clean; final image ("clock stops blinking") lands with rhythmic snap.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—image + concept—without scaffold. One mixed metaphor cluster (“towers rolled on hidden bearings”) momentarily jars but does not taint closure. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; paragraph cuts are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud ear rewards variable cadence; no template churn or paraphrase loops detected. Metaphors are dense yet internally coherent—vehicles stay within light/cellar/sip domains. Only micro-slip: “meadow of rainbows” momentarily mixes agricultural vehicle with glass architecture, but the clause is too brief to dilute closure. Opening and final lines anchor and re-charge the motif of ribbons/cranes with precise image economy.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Metaphor density nears overload in places (“purple cathedral under skin,” “cold machine choir”), risking coherence, but each image advances atmosphere or stakes; no mixed metaphors break physics. A few template cadences (“I came… I am… I hunt…”) dull momentum, yet propulsion survives to the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm flexes from long tidal sentences to the staccato of planks being named. Information density is high: each driftwood line carries birth, debt, or surname. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay maritime and archival. Minor template cadence in “the terrace wore its evening blues / the city unrolled its lamps” but it echoes the panoramic sweep and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers weather, body, and politics without scaffold. Metaphors (wind as cold fingers, moon as clipped coin) recur with purpose, never congesting beats. One paraphrase loop—“furrowed hush” appears twice within six lines—drops the score a hair. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene tension.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Varied sentence openings, muscular verbs (“hammering,” “shoving,” “eased free”), no filler stacks. Metaphors stay nautical and mechanical without mixed collisions—gavel, stitches, circuits all belong to a navigator’s toolkit. No paraphrase loops; each image advances either water-state or emotional valence. Final line “open and used” is irreplaceable compression of chart = heart—zero scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: each sentence advances image or stakes; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for descent, staccato for heat spike. Metaphors stay internally consistent (lake as bruise, ball as moon). One near-loop “delicately robust” repeated, but the echo is thematic, not scaffolding. Closing line crystallizes without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is incantatory yet varied; sentences shift from short beats (‘I choose the first’) to spiralling anaphora (‘Cumin for laughter…’) without template drift; every line advances spell or atmosphere; no mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops—closure image is pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence advances image or stakes (“lock listened to weight like a judge”). No loops or synonym churn; metaphors are coherent (quilt of hulls, minnow-seeds). Rhythm breathes with zero-G drift; paragraph breaks mirror breath units. Clean grammar, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene—short beats for bottle drops, lengthened sentences for celestial crawl. Metaphors stay coherent (tidal fingers / raft) and pay off. No scaffold loops; information dense (“gave away coincidence”). Proofing clean, pronoun track perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    High metaphor density but patterned and justified—every lantern, hinge, wink re-illuminates blackout premise. No mixed metaphors; “bronze quill holder thrumming like a quiet heart” stays inside physical logic. Minor scaffold in “time is different when lamps go missing” restates known; clipped for momentum elsewhere. Final third clean, no artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Density high—single sentences braid sensory, math, and metaphor: “polyrhythms of primes” simultaneously cue sound and pattern. No paraphrase loops; each rock placed advances either tactic or cost. Mixed-metaphor risk (“velvet gravity”) is accepted because physics is already dream-logic. Occasional modifier stack (“slick corridor between two moments”) momentarily thickens flow.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is supple: paragraph lengths swell and contract like storm gusts. Metaphors are selective—lightning as marginalia, timer as metronome—and never stack beyond one per beat. One near-loop: “furiously tranquil” repeats three times; the echo is purposeful but still noticeable, clipping the 9+ rung. Otherwise, information density is high—each sentence advances atlas, body, or stakes—and no scaffolding obscures the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm varies: long lyrical sentences early, short declaratives under blade clash. Information density high—each sentence layers light, code, body. One coherence slip: “apple cores left near school steps” momentarily jars register, but recovers in final line. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay consistent—fencing as argument, travel as philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and musical—lines twin image with action: “spill pennies inked with phrases we can spend on hesitating strangers.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent (fence-harp, skyline-teeth) and do not crowd high-pressure beats. Minor register lift in “luminous fracture of a pattern healing by surprise” is justified by poet’s own lexicon. Clean grammar, vivid verbs (“ghosting,” “exhales”), correct quote mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear is strong: cadence rises and falls like a performance, with deliberate breath-spacing. Metaphors are selective and coherent—film “whispering like shells,” tide “drawing strands of light”—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold slip: “he felt the pull of the station schedule, strict as winter” is abstract tell amid show; minor. No loops or synonym churn; information density is high. Peak beat clarity is preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: every line layers scent, sound, or light while advancing seed or storm. Metaphors stay coherent under water-sky logic; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold in “the island no longer needed me to waken it” (conceptual summary) but occurs post-closure and does not dull final image. Read-aloud cadence shifts from tidal surge to punctuated drip, mirroring weather; no loops or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long tidal sentences to staccato release: “I spoke… set them to drift.” Figurative layering (compass as throbbing tooth, sea as larger lung) stays coherent within maritime corpus. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal data. Minor dock: “diffuse the sky into kinder shavings” risks mixed metaphor, but casuarina needles literally shave light, so physics holds.

Sentence openings vary (“After the mysterious package…”, “I hold the glass…”, “So I go…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. One minor artifact: “inadvertently stubborn” appears twice, but the repetition serves thematic reinforcement rather than scaffold, and closure clarity remains unharmed.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “air brittle with frost and held breath,” “scarcity, when braided with care, could become a braid strong enough to lift a season.” Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

Final line (“viaduct breathe easier”) lands with earned simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict (“bridges grow where footprints wish to be”). Figurative language is coherent: coral-like curves, harp-like ash tree, submerged sentences. Minor overwriting in “hyperbolic geometry” passages slightly blurs causality, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“garden blooms into quaking reverie that holds still”) resolves with rhythmic precision, echoing the opening’s trembling notes without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with near-zero loops or scaffold. Each sentence multitasks: “drowned apple trees hold their leaves like green coins” establishes setting, metaphor, and economic motif. Figurative language is coherent—aurora as “bruised flags,” betrayal as “glass harmonica”—never muddled. Minor deduction for slight over-density in mid-text (“anneal voids and shape the outlines that conversations avoid”), but peak beats remain clear.

    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“water forgets our shapes while remembering our salt”). Figurative language is coherent—doubt glows, pollen coats like testimony, rain spells names—and avoids muddle even in peak beats. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“reef of stories that must not bleach”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s “commas sewing breath into the ridge” perfectly encapsulates the story’s ethos without redundancy.

    Prose achieves high information density: “cerulean regret walled every horizon” merges color, emotion, and spatial constraint; “sea tongued the shore with rhythmically placid hunger” fuses action, sound, and paradox. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“rhythmically placid” recurs with evolving valence) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “rhythmically placid” (three times)—a hairline loop—but it serves thematic accumulation, not redundancy. Final line (“remember us kindly, blue”) resonates without scaffold.
