  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "scorched testament" recurs five times without functional variation; "drifting resonance" appears thrice as decorative refrain. Template cadence dominates the final third: "She would not destroy... She would transform... She would encase... She would build... She would dedicate." Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "canyon's deep silence," "vessel of transformed truth," "gentle beacon." Stock metaphors ("stars that held their breath," "spirit annealed") dull closure. Artifacts touch the ending, triggering the disallow-9+ cap globally and −1.2 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and propulsion is adequate, but several lines loop or paraphrase adjacent content: "They understood they had not restored noise, nor sought to. / They had discovered a deeper resonance" restates the same idea. Template cadence appears in the opening sequence ("The violent memory...had fused," "Her sanctuary was," "Hardy snowdrops...thrived"). Figurative language is dense ("deep indigo swirls," "liquid gold," "silvery thread") but mostly coherent. Minor scaffold remains ("a monument to unspoken guilt" is stock). The ending's clarity is strong, keeping line debt from touching closure. Information density is good in the central beats; opening exposition could compress further.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance image, action, or interiority. However, several scaffold patterns recur: "His [noun] was [abstract concept]" appears three times in the opening, and synonym loops ("rest a permanent address" / "rest its permanent address") create mild redundancy. The phrase "occupy impossible spaces" and "revitalize" feel like undigested prompt tokens. Figurative language is dense but coherent (fractures as captured stars, sediment metaphor). Clarity remains intact, but the cumulative line-level artifacts and template cadence in the opening lower the score and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    Overwriting clusters in the closure beat: "infinite tenderness," "crystalline note," "fragile resonance," "profound affirmation" stack figurative language without functional pressure. Template cadence appears: "cumulative X" markers are scaffold artifacts left visible. Paraphrase loops: "amplified quiet" recurs five times, and "gently persistent" is restated as "quiet reciprocity" and "intentional silence" without adding new detail. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") dull immediacy in peak moments. Paragraph structure varies, and spatial choreography is clear, preventing deeper collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high across most beats: "pilgrim of sparks," "liquid gold," "seeds on a breeze," "altar of healed hearts." Many adjacent sentences restate the same content with decorative variation (e.g., "recognition; this love was not wasted, but preserved" followed immediately by theme statement). Template cadence appears in the breathing sequence: "She closed her eyes... As she exhaled... Another breath... Her breathing shifted..." The loop triggers −0.6, and the unmodulated metaphor strings in peak beats (golden light, dandelion seeds, blossoms radiant) add −0.4 for density without escalation. Final-third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence structure supports scene needs. Information density is high with integrated world-building. Several paraphrase loops appear: "texture of time" recurs five times; "trembling/quaking" and "reverie" cluster without added pressure. Template stems appear ("She'd spend," "She felt," "She was"). The disintegration sequence stacks metaphors ("gracefully unspool," "spiraling upward," "dissolving into morning air") with minor vehicle drift. Figurative density in peak beats approaches overwriting without full pattern-teaching. Clarity remains intact but propulsion dulls.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (each line advances multiple layers). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("iron anchor," "quiet ember," "seeds of resilience," "sacred tether," "sundial's hand," "arrow as vessel of promise") without pattern-teaching or functional payoff, triggering overwriting density penalty (−0.5). "Staggering grace" recurs three times (150, 205, 279) as motif, but the phrase itself is abstract and the repetition borders on stock metaphor. The final third maintains clarity, but the lyric overlay obscures urgency at the bulldozer's approach (lines 196–231 slow momentum with reflection when the clock should accelerate).

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense throughout, with mixed-vehicle metaphors ("colors…heard as…choir," "silence woven from…salt") and elevated diction that clashes with scene immediacy. Template cadence: "She heard…She focused…She saw…She would…" across multiple beats. Paraphrase loops: lines 213/219, 257/266, 290/300 restate without added pressure. The phrase "while cells divide" recurs as ornamental refrain without causal linkage (lines 116, 192, 355). Artifacts touch the closure third; apply −1.2 baseline and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "bled across the sky," "liquid jade," "cherished ember," "compass forged from moonlight." Mixed metaphors appear ("pressed her ear against destiny's door" shifts to "the door had swung open" without bridging the auditory/entry fusion). Template cadence in the final third: multiple sentences open with "She had" or "The" in succession. Paraphrase loop: "reinterpreted not just a floral code, but her entire life's narrative" and "shifting from observer to author" restate the same content. Minor scaffolding like "With careful hands" and "Her breath caught" are functional but generic. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering cumulative penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level craft shows strong sensory specificity ("frost-rimed floor," "liquid metronome," "captured dawn") and varied sentence rhythm in early beats. However, the piece suffers from pervasive overwriting: nearly every sentence in the second half carries figurative language or abstract phrasing ("vessels of glass where fragile questions could breathe," "the gravity of memory held gently by hope," "a symphony of release") that accumulates density without advancing pressure. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "The thawing heart was real" immediately follows "her chest felt open, her breath deep and easy"—both asserting the same state. Template cadence runs through the narration beats ("She began her ritual," "She dipped the blowpipe," "She shaped the molten core"). The final third is laden with abstraction ("weighty lightness filled the room," "her own thaw was complete") that dulls the closure image's concreteness. Apply −0.9 in Q7 for overwriting density and paraphrase loops in peak beats; also note the artifacts touch the closure section, which disallows 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences cluster in high-pressure beats: "transformative betrayal" appears three times; "trembling certainty" twice; "firmly adaptive" twice as label without embodiment. The phrase "The transformative betrayal deepened—he had weaponized his late wife's cherished object to control his daughter—but vulnerability became their compass" is exposition summary at the climax, not scene pressure. Filter verbs ("her eyes traced," "watched Silas storm") dull immediacy. Overwriting appears in "feverish betrayal still scorching her veins beneath the indifferent stars" where elevated diction clashes with urgency. Paragraph-cut test: multiple beats restate "vulnerability" and "betrayal" without adding pressure, totaling ~−1.0 cumulative in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence openings and vivid concrete detail. However, figurative density is high throughout ("bruised and weeping sky," "granite ramparts clawed," "salt-bleached," "diamond pinned to fading velvet," "fossilized within the calm," "dense tapestry," "silver-threaded hush") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff tied to a causal beat. Paraphrase loops appear: "ambered hush" is defined, then re-explained as "silence so absolute it felt encased in golden resin," then restated as "dense tapestry woven from absent wind." The final third repeats "marbled hush" and "ambered hush" without new pressure. Overwriting in peak beats triggers −0.5; paraphrase loops add −0.4; combined artifacts total approximately −0.9 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is largely clear and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory details ("frost feathers," "glittering motes"). However, multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "The origin of thought is the journey of integration, not a hidden location" restates the prior sentence's content. Runs of "It [verb]" constructions across paragraphs create rhythmic monotony. Stock metaphors—"temporal prison to sanctuary," "sacred participation," "grand synthesis"—appear in the final third without fresh embodiment. Filter verbs ("felt," "perceived") stack in the climax paragraphs, dulling immediacy. These artifacts reduce information density and slow momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high and often stacked: "quiet fire," "brittle trust," "fortress of isolation," "seeds of reconciliation," "transparency waters the soil" appear within short spans, blurring concrete action. Several lines paraphrase prior content without added pressure: "Transparency had not erased mystery; it had made space for it to breathe" restates the reconciliation arc already shown. Template stems recur ("Her motivation was...," "She understood then...," "The crystals hum their agreement") signaling scaffold. Register drifts into abstraction ("radical transparency," "ambiguously clear") that sits uneasily with the POV's lyric texture. The closure paragraph ("freedom blooms where honesty waters the soil") leans on metaphor rather than concrete image, dulling propulsion. Artifacts touch the final third, triggering cumulative penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the ritual beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "cracks as failure—a deception of worthlessness. But her polish did not hide flaws; it illuminated them, filling fissures with light, mending the lie by revealing beauty" restates the same idea across three clauses. The phrase "blooming potential and withering history in honest balance" recurs conceptually in multiple forms, and the final paragraph ("every crack in glass or vine was not hidden but healed, not broken but beautifully, completely mended") loops the central metaphor without propulsion. Filter verbs ("she felt the maze exhale," "Elara felt it") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Template cadence in the opening lines (mapped/tangled, blooming/withering) reads as patterned setup but remains legible. Clarity is strong, but momentum drags in the closing third due to repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and many lines carry strong imagery ("thermal suit crackling," "silent, swirling tapestry of crystalline strands"). Clarity and causality are intact. However, several phrases exhibit template cadence and ornamental stacking: "mechanically warm" recurs three times in similar constructions, "icy warmth" appears twice as a neat paradox without evolving meaning, and "hush of beating wings at rest" is used as both timeframe and thematic echo without fresh pressure. Figurative density is high in atmospheric passages without pattern-teaching, and some lines paraphrase prior content (e.g., the final paragraph restates the shift from proving to listening). Apply −0.6 for patterned artifacts (recurring label phrases, moderate stacking) and −0.2 for paraphrase loop in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong images (droplets mirroring Orion, fermata glowing). However, multiple paraphrase loops and synonym clusters appear: "lately inspired" recurs without added pressure, "hush"/"silence" are restated across adjacent lines, and "in between" is recycled as both spatial and thematic shorthand. Template cadence is present in the opening paragraph's stacked clauses and in the closing sequence's parallel constructions ("not merely…but"; "not a void…but a bridge"). Stock metaphors—"spark now a steady flame," "bridge of understanding"—appear in the final third without fresh embodiment. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") cluster in peak beats, dulling immediacy. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate thematic claims rather than advancing image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives during memory flash, longer accumulative sentences during aurora witness). However, several lines border on overwriting: "the swaying certainties of the world were not a flaw to correct, but the very texture of a living truth" and "a river of sorrowful emerald and violet light bleeding across the star-dusted sky" stack metaphor without adding plot pressure. Minor paraphrase loop: "swaying certainties" appears three times with slight variation. The smudge mechanics are legible, and peak beats (tear falling, aurora rising) remain clear. No scaffolding or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several artifacts appear: "swallowed truth" is recycled four times without reweighting; "profound" modifies both "hush" and "silence"; template stems ("He was," "He replayed," "He reached," "He understood") cluster in the middle third. The backstory paragraph at the wheel, while causal, paraphrases its own points (grandfather tried to prevent / ordered sealed shut / never got the chance). Deduct −0.8 for loops and template cadence touching a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory specificity ("moss to stitch broken flagstones with emerald thread," "blind silver fish darting"). However, multiple beats exhibit paraphrase loops and template cadence: "She observed without sorrow or praise" followed immediately by a colon that restates observation. Figurative density is high throughout without pressure variance—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction, flattening momentum. Lines like "transformation's gentle, inevitable flow" and "regenerative silence" recur as abstract placeholders. No scaffold or syntax errors, but information density is low; many sentences restate theme rather than advance knowledge or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    Imagery is vivid and purposeful: "sun-dappled root," "honey-blond curl," "coppery twilight." Sentences vary in rhythm and no major loops appear. However, prompt-language recurs heavily: "softly adaptive" (×3), "ordinary magic" (×4), "dreaming roots" (×3), "cautious exuberance" (×2), "link" (×5). These phrases function as thematic anchors but create a template cadence in peak beats. The final paragraph summarizes the arc ("The ordinary magic was complete") rather than trusting the image to close. Density is high, but scaffold phrases dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clarity is high; information density is good (most lines advance story or atmosphere). However, several paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs appear: "He felt…," "He understood…," "He was…," "He listened…," "He smiled…" cluster in the final third, creating a monotonous syntactic pattern. "The displaced axis was dual" is followed immediately by restating the same idea. "Bronze quiet" recurs without evolving pressure (lines 2, 27, and implicitly at the end). One stock phrase: "a gentle disturbance in the profound stillness." These artifacts dull momentum in the closure beats, triggering baseline Q7 penalties and disqualifying 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in most beats (e.g., the microdot paragraph economically layers object, history, and plan). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Two issues lower the score: elevated diction ("transpose…into a new key," "the cessation of its sweep") occasionally clashes with urgency, and abstract phrasing in the middle third ("orchestrate by directing flow," "the method") echoes prompt language rather than concrete action. The final paragraph's repetition of "transposed" feels slightly forced. No clarity breaks; grammar and spatial choreography are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short beats during climax, longer reflective loops), and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. However, template cadence appears in runs: "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems repeat across adjacent sentences in the opening third, and synonym churn surfaces in "dimensional static," "oppressive chill," "frayed edges knitting." Paraphrase loops are minimal but present ("not void—it was decorated" echoes "not emptiness"). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "cold vine coiling" and "loops weaving a net" are clear. The closure beat is clean, so accumulated line-level slips warrant modest deduction under the non-closure cap.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is mostly concrete. Information density is high in the mapping sequence (four memories placed with distinct sensory and spatial logic). However, mild overwriting appears in figurative clusters: "chronological homesickness," "upturned hush," "silent music woven from forgotten seconds," and "ether" accumulate in the opening third without clear pattern-teaching, causing brief register drift. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the final two paragraphs recycle the transformation thesis ("chronological homesickness transformed," "silent symphonies," "unheard note longing to be heard") with synonym churn. The closure image itself is clean, but the exit material dilutes propulsion. No major grammar or sequence errors.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.9)
    Heavy overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("bruised twilight," "distorted smear," "swirling chaos," "precipice of forgotten birthdays") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density that obscures propulsion. Paraphrase loops accumulate: "fractured timelines" appears six times, "procedural generation" eight times, often restating function without advancing pressure. Template cadence dominates peaks: "She traced... and the fractured timelines began to weave," "The procedural generation reshaped...," "The glowing viaduct reformed..." Artifacts touch the closure beat ("The periodically eternal cycle was transcended"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and global 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied, with strong imagery (amber leaves, copper wires, ghostly cascade). However, the piece carries noticeable text artifacts: "emotional numbness" appears as a label in multiple beats without fresh embodiment; the final third stacks near-synonyms ("vibrant, humming aliveness," "tactile symphony," "fertile ground") and template-style reflection ("Memories flooded her—not as sounds, but as textures"). Paraphrase loops appear: "The numbness dissolved" is restated as "no longer defined by absence" within two paragraphs. These lower density and dull the closure image slightly. Apply baseline −0.6 for patterned artifacts; an additional −0.2 for paraphrase loop touching the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm is generally clear, but overwriting clusters appear: "meticulous storm recorder," "layered tranquility," "credible curiosity," "nurture integrity in solitude" all deploy elevated register that slows propulsion. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but template cadence emerges in the mid-section ("Her motivation crystallized," "Her resolve firm," "Her solitude was fertile ground"). The final paragraph's stacked abstractions ("purposeful stillness," "fertile ground," "quiet, persistent force") dull immediacy. Information density is high, but figurative layering in non-crisis beats (wisteria, jasmine, violet-hued twilight) exceeds necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in sensory beats (clay, grooves, vibration). However, paraphrase loops appear: "uncovering layers" is stated twice in adjacent paragraphs (beat 11, 12), and "impossible choice" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence in middle beats: "He traced… He felt… He felt… He brushed…" Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "time's fabric" and "tapestry" cohere. The final paragraph over-explains rather than trusting the image: "He had learned that discovering time's texture required not force, but reverence for the tension between paths" summarizes the climax instead of letting it breathe. Apply −0.6 for loops and scaffold in non-closure beats, −0.3 for over-explanation in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence appear throughout: "chronic hush" is restated four times with near-synonyms (absence, void, suffocating silence, companion); "unbind" and its variants recur in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Figurative density is high in every paragraph (velvety blanket, golden thread, fertile silence, receptive canvas), blurring specificity. The closure beat—"chronic hush was no longer an enemy, but a companion"—is clear but the path there is padded with redundant restatements. Information density is low; many lines do one job.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity and rhythm are generally strong, with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph cuts. However, persistent paraphrase loops and template cadence reduce density: "Tonight, the static buzzed…"; "Shadows pooled…"; "Static surged…"; "Static on his skin became…"; "And the static hummed…" recycles the same stem across multiple beats without added pressure. The final paragraph ("He was no longer merely a dealer; he was a bridge. And the static hummed its quiet approval. Always.") stacks three summary declarations in place of a concrete final image. These artifacts dull the closure beat, triggering the −0.6 to −1.4 range for patterned loops plus the disallow-9+ penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (each beat advances). However, several lines exhibit decorative stacking: "salt-kissed breeze whispered through forgotten poetry volumes on wrought-iron stands" layers modifiers without adding pressure; "star-dusted canopy" and "logistics of the soul" are elevated but not egregious. One paraphrase loop: paragraphs on Elara's invisibility echo across Elias's and Liam's beats without new detail. The bracketed word counts ([10, cumulative…]) are scaffold artifacts; treated as non-textual per rubric, they do not trigger deduction but signal generation seams. Propulsion is steady, though peak beats favor metaphor over immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often beautiful ("forged of solidified light," "liquid starlight"), but clusters heavily in descriptive passages without always advancing pressure. Minor paraphrase loops: "luminescent ache" recurs three times; "web" and "kinship" are restated across adjacent lines without added detail. Template cadence in the final section: "She placed… 'I dedicate…' The words wove… Kael covered… 'The graft has taken root…' As they rose…" reads as a sequence of declarative fulfillment beats with identical stems. These artifacts dull momentum at the closure and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is mostly smooth, but template cadence appears in clusters: "She believed... She possessed... She poured... She would..." across key beats (lines 54, 109, 200, 262). Paraphrase loops: lines 159 and 118 restate "borrowed time" and "borrowed seconds" without added pressure. Figurative density is high throughout—"clay in her illustrator's hands," "thread from a spindle," "shape of memory, color of a voice"—and while voice-motivated, the accumulation in nearly every sentence during the Pause and unlocking beats (lines 132–208) crosses into overwriting without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty (~−0.5). Minor: "absolute silence" and "motionless canals" repeat the stasis concept adjacently. Information density is moderate; many lines do two jobs (world-building + mood) but few advance choice.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and figurative language is purposeful in most beats. Paraphrase loop detected: "The silence was not absence; it was a different mode of presence, a deep and abiding fullness" restates the prior vision's conclusion without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence: "she had always carried but never named," "it was speaking in a language of water and memory," "not a problem to solve, but a mystery to live" repeat the X-not-Y-but-Z frame across closure beats without variation (−0.4). No filter-verb stacks or major clarity breaks. Closure remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is generally high, with most sentences advancing atmosphere or action. However, loops and near-paraphrases appear: "the crawl space dweller" echoes "Deep within the crawl space" within two paragraphs; "profound sapphire hush" recurs without functional reweighting; "sense memory" appears three times in similar phrasing. The figurative language is dense in the opening and closing thirds ("surrendering the shadowed library," "minutes stretched like taffy"), occasionally slowing momentum. Template cadence is mild but present in the middle section's "She [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors ("dust motes...swirling gold," "tears streamed freely") dilute specificity at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clear and sentence openings vary, with strong information density in places (linden leaf imagery, oak memory). However, pervasive scaffold appears: "metamorphosis" / "transformation" / "reconstruct" recur as synonym churn across adjacent lines and paragraphs (lines 44, 57, 119, 126, 137, 187, 245, 274), and template cadence runs through multiple "she [verb]" openers in the middle third. The final paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("reluctant metamorphosis," "graceful, enduring flow") where a concrete image would sharpen closure. Aggregate artifact penalty applies; these loops dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short beats at exchange, longer reflective turns while painting). Information density is high: most lines advance image, memory, or choice. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and recharge motifs cleanly. Figurative language is controlled ("rain trails...like veins," "memory is a current") without muddle. Two craft slips lower the score from high-8s: "wryly earnest" recurs four times across the piece, becoming a tic rather than a charged leitmotif; and the phrase "the weight of" appears twice in close proximity ("weight of a child," "weight of the object"), creating minor template echo. Propulsion remains strong; no loops or scaffold otherwise.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold phrasing. "Bright darkness" recurs formulaically; "unseen forces" and "overlapping shadows" are restated without new pressure. The final third contains multiple summary sentences ("In the cave's enduring symphony, Elara understood her blindness") that externalize the epiphany rather than anchoring it in concrete action. Template cadence appears in repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" openings. Figurative language is dense but occasionally mixed ("breathing in hues," "shadows woven from absence").

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid (verdigris, linseed oil, cobblestones), but the prose carries template-cadence artifacts: "Her entire purpose was crystallized," "This was her gift and burden," "Her deeper purpose crystallized" echo across paragraphs. Stock metaphors—"torn tapestry," "silent beacon," "fulfilled promise"—appear in high-pressure beats without fresh specificity. Paraphrase loop: "to compile these scattered fragments into coherent meaning" (paragraph 6) restates "compile fragments into meaning" without added pressure. Deduct −0.6 in Q7 for template stems and stock strings; cumulative artifact spread touching multiple beats warrants the penalty and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is ornate and rhythmically controlled in places ("sacred, breath-held threshold of midnight"), but overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: almost every sentence in the climax carries figurative or elevated diction without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence appears in the resolution ("The weight anchoring…dissolved, replaced by…"; "felt not a mapper…but a traveler…"). Paraphrase loops cluster: "unraveling mysteries achieved its ultimate resolution—not as external discovery, but as internal unspooling" restates the same idea across two clauses. Mixed metaphors: "dawn's faint, rose-gold promise" follows "mist glowed," conflating timeframes. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the lower range of the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but scaffold phrasing ("with tender care," "finally, peacefully") pads without advancing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective, but the piece carries pervasive pattern artifacts: "courageously kind" appears three times, "sculpt/sculpted space" recurs mechanically, and several beats open with similar participial structures ("Unrolling the brittle journal," "Reading of stargazers," "With reverent hands"). The vision sequence stacks metaphor without grounding ("symphony of pure resonance," "tapestry of resilience," "silent chord") and the final two paragraphs loop thematic claims. Template cadence across multiple lines and label-reliance in peak beats (tears, warmth, "palpable") trigger cumulative artifact penalties and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.2)
    Overwriting pervades: "profound silence," "impossible scale," "perpetual, silent aurora," "flawless, suffocating sheen." Mixed metaphors cluster ("visual monotony" paired with "shifting rainbows"; "fragile ember" that "burns"). Paraphrase loops: "spatial mutiny had commenced" / "reality peeled back" / "space rebelling" restate the same event. Template cadence: "He rose... He perceived... He floated... He emerged" across consecutive paragraphs. Key closure beat is summary ("Kaelen stood again... transformed") rather than propulsion. Artifacts touch the ending, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping this category.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines often doing double duty (e.g., the ink pot description anchors both setting and metaphor). However, the piece exhibits template cadence in several beats ("She would offer… She would redact…") and paraphrase loops in adjacent lines (e.g., "fair trade" restated across three sentences near closure). Stock metaphors ("lightning strike," "sacred threshold," "dawn bled") appear in high-pressure moments without transformation. These artifacts measurably dull the closure image's specificity, warranting deduction in Q7 only per the routing rule.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence openings and paragraph lengths vary purposefully, and information density is high. However, repeated stems ("She [verb]" openers in paragraphs 10–14, 22–23) and template cadence ("Each dawn," "No customer," "The mountain held") accumulate to −0.6. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 15–18 restate "invented histories honor silence" without added pressure, triggering −0.2. Figurative density ("blooming labyrinth," "incandescent restraint," "rose-gold," "frozen laughter") pervades without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure, applying −0.5. Total −1.3 in Q7. Clarity remains high, but the artifact load and loop presence disallow 9+ globally and prevent high-band entry here.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high: "death certificate error survivor whose legal erasure had gifted him a nameless identity" packs backstory into one efficient clause. However, template cadence and synonym loops appear: multiple sentences open with "He [verb]" across the piece, and the poison-label beat recycles "fragment" and "texture" without adding new pressure. "Fragile mosaics," "erased histories," "unmoored spirit" edge toward stock metaphor strings in a lyric register. The final third repeats "fragment" and "whisper" in adjacent lines without progression, triggering paraphrase-loop and template-cadence penalties (−0.6 to −0.8 in Q7). Figurative language is dense but occasionally strained: "steel cliffs" and "salt-laced wind carried fragmented sentences" work, but "vessels of memory" in the penultimate section feels generic. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings shift, avoiding monotony. Clarity is high; no ambiguous pronouns or tense breaks. However, overwriting clusters in several beats: "wind-scoured cliff edge," "salt-tinged breath of the churning sea," "indigo bled into the horizon" pile figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff. The phrase "gloomy cheerfulness" recurs three times, the last as summary exposition rather than image. Template cadence appears in the final third: "The decoded riddle settled deep... The myth she'd sought... The shell and cello were not magic..." These scaffold loops dull momentum and trigger the Text Artifact deduction (−0.6 for spread across closure zone). One paraphrase loop: paragraphs 16–17 restate the compass concept. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty, but the ending paragraphs summarize rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    Opening anchors voice and stakes effectively. Information density is generally high, but several lines loop or paraphrase: "dual allegiance that strained his spirit" is restated across paragraphs, and "fragile hope" / "hopeful desperation" recur without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the graffiti-work sequence: "Near the silent Ferris wheel, he reorganized... Above the spice market's fragrant stalls, he added..." Filter verbs ("watched," "felt," "thought") cluster in reflection without always advancing immediacy. Figurative language ("invisible bridges," "nervous system") is coherent but elevated in a few high-pressure beats. No severe artifacts, but cumulative loop and scaffold issues prevent entry to the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several patterns recur: "outlasted the biting wind… outlasted the deep cold… outlasted the waves of grief" is purposeful parallelism, yet "purposefully curious nature," "purposeful mission," "purposeful curiosity" within three paragraphs reads as template stem. "Dawnlit melancholy" appears twice in identical phrasing without reweighting. The chemical-reaction mechanism is clear but told in summary rather than woven through action. Figurative language is frequent and mostly coherent ("sweet and sorrowful ache," "drinking in the dawn"), though "sliver of impossible gold fractured the horizon" stacks modifiers. Minor synonym churn ("profound silence"/"profound quiet"). Proofreading is clean; no loops touch the closure beat directly, but the accumulation of stock phrases and parallel stems dulls momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is specific (moonstone-infused resin warmed "pliable as honey," brush "finer than spider silk"). However, template stems recur across the final third: "She [verb]" opens six sentences in quick succession during the patch sequence, and paraphrase loops appear ("calm," "magnetic calm," "profound calm" within two paragraphs). The closing lines cycle through theme statements ("she saw the path," "her calm a steady anchor," "magnetic calm of her purpose") without advancing pressure, triggering −0.6 for cadence and loop artifacts in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and momentum are strong; sentences advance atmosphere and knowledge efficiently. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is mostly controlled. However, several paraphrase loops appear: lines 131 and 122 both assert convergence; lines 139 and 242 restate "worrying tranquility" shifting to peace; "the polyglot's phrasebook" is described twice in similar terms (lines 91, 165). Template cadence in the middle third ("The falcon's return was...," "This was the singular convergence...," "Her motivation crystallized...") flattens propulsion. Apply −0.6 for loops and template runs, per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, but information density is low: many lines restate the same action (footsteps restore, memory rekindles) without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in mid-section beats: "A shutter... swung," "At the dry well...," "Past the blacksmith's forge..." (location + passive effect). Paraphrase loops include "rekindled," "woven back," "restored" across adjacent paragraphs. Metaphor is consistent but occasionally strained ("threads of silver light" coexisting with "moss... respectful shadows"). The final third avoids major artifacts, preserving closure clarity, but cumulative scaffold and synonym churn lower momentum earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The unsnarling sequence propels cleanly. However, overwriting appears in clusters: "profound, gathered hush," "lonesome splendor," "bittersweet anchor to purpose" stack figurative language without clear payoff. Paraphrase loop detected: "gathered hush" and variations recur without functional evolution. Stock metaphors ("crushing dark," "cold fire") appear in peak beats, triggering cumulative −0.8 under patterned-artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy overwriting in peak beats: "copperlight repose," "secular revelation," "impossibility the prison sustained," "thread this stone labyrinth" stack figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear in the final third: "Kael had not shouted. He had simply held the lattice…" / "He had chased the hush not to escape noise…" / "He was no longer chasing hush. He was cradling it." Template cadence runs across multiple paragraphs ("The door had hung…," "Behind it lay…," "From his coat, Kael withdrew…"). These artifacts dull momentum and obscure the closure image. Deduction baseline: −1.2 for density + loops + register drift; escalated to −1.4 because artifacts pervade the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure and vivid imagery ("bark like cracked obsidian," "silver blossoms unfurled with a soft chime"). However, scaffold and loop patterns accumulate: "lovingly venomous" appears three times, "carved stone bead" eight times often in identical phrasing, "mournful elation" twice, and "resonant awakenings" as a repeated label. Paraphrase loops cluster in the backstory section (lines 140–153) where betrayal, poisoning, and the alchemist's vow are recounted with synonym variation rather than propulsion. Stock metaphors ("threads in redemption's tapestry," "wave of light cascaded") appear without fresh specificity. The cumulative word-count annotations after each sentence are generation artifacts and do not affect story clarity, but the template cadence and repetitive anchors ("she," "the carved stone bead," "her") across adjacent lines dull momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphor in nearly every sentence ("liquid mirror," "ghost of intention," "tapestry of hauntingly optimistic solace"). This creates cumulative register drift and some mixed vehicles (thread "gleaming like captured starlight" then "charged by dream-consensus"). Paraphrase loops appear: "haunted by hauntingly optimistic resolve/balance/solace" recurs three times; "broken precedents" appears twice in identical phrasing without added pressure. Template cadence in the sewing sequence ("She began to sew... Each stitch carried... Where two dream-paths overlapped...") and minor filter-verb stacks ("she believed," "reminded that") dull immediacy in peak beats. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 penalty and the global 9+ disqualifier.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmically controlled, with strong image-making ("roots cradling bones like tender guardians," "the veil between worlds thin to gossamer"). However, multiple text artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("interrupted journeys" appears four times with minimal reweighting), repeated sentence stems ("Each scoop... each uncovered..."; "She learned... Wandering taught..."), and elevated metaphors cluster densely in high-pressure beats without breathing room. The final two paragraphs summarize rather than dramatize, and stock phrases ("coming home," "eternal breath") dull closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "carefully inventive" appears twice; "margin/margins" recurs six times in near-identical thematic claims; "futuristic nostalgia" is stated twice and restated conceptually in multiple beats. Template cadence in the final third: "She remembered... She cherished... She turned..." Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "knew," "carried") dull immediacy in peak beats. Mixed metaphor: "ebony clipboard... was her sanctuary" then "vessel that had held perfect alignment." Stock phrasing: "tears pricked her eyes," "promise sent into the world." These artifacts cluster near closure, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level clarity is high; grammar and pronoun references are clean. Information density is good in the divination sequence (lines 123–148). Yet paraphrase loops appear: lines 72 and 81 both assert "disguises wisdom as foolishness"; lines 180 and 188 reiterate steady hands and night-long work. Template cadence runs: "She [verb]" stems across lines 188, 198, 214, 226, 252, 260, 268 create drumbeat monotony in the climactic final third. Stock metaphors ("embers" for leaves, "tapestry of lies") and elevated abstractions ("synchronizing the final thread—a filament of captured dawn light" at 198) layer figurative language densely without pattern-teaching, triggering overwriting penalties. Artifacts touch the closure sequence, disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant density and figurative language pervade high-pressure beats without clear pattern payoff: "noose of pride and fear," "hinge—the moment before deciding," "burden dissolving in moonlight." Multiple paraphrase loops: paragraph recounting Kael's regret echoes earlier exposition; "fierce tenderness" recurs four times without evolving. Template cadence in the final third: "The mangrove labyrinth, once... now..."; "Above, the moon poured..."; "He finally understood..." Filter-verb reliance ("saw his younger self," "saw Lena") stacks in the vision sequence. Stock metaphors ("sharp" fear, "soft" luminescence) and therapy-speak ("decade of grief," "healing washed over") reduce precision. Artifacts touch closure beats, triggering accumulation penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact-penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line-level clarity is generally high; sentences advance character and atmosphere. However, several prose artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops (e.g., "unknot the rigid terror" / "unknotting was not erasure" / "unknot the meaning"), template cadence in the reflective middle ("This was…" / "That memory had been…" / "But here…"), and stock metaphor strings ("watercolor haze," "cold knot in her chest," "hollow stares"). The closing third stacks elevated diction ("pacific translator of sorrows") and summary beats that dilute propulsion. No single artifact severely harms closure, but the cumulative effect lowers momentum and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the piece carries multiple prose artifacts. Paraphrase loops appear: "the fog thickened with possibility" / "moisture-laden fog acted precisely as exposed film" restates the mechanism. Template cadence runs: "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems recur across adjacent lines without taught pattern. Stock metaphors ("like magic in a darkroom tray," "fading embers") and elevated register ("crystalline moment," "sacred circle") appear in peak beats without sufficient grounding. The closure beat itself is clean, but the mid-section carries −0.6 to −0.8 in scaffold and figurative density. No filter-verb stacks disqualify 9+ globally, but the artifacts prevent entry to high bands here.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.7)
    Multiple line-level issues: paraphrase loops ("awakening" repeated across three beats; "pause" echoed in setup and resolution), template cadence in exposition ("This was the first... A second... A third"), stock metaphors ("perception expanding like a blooming flower," "heavy cloak"), and register drift into therapeutic abstraction ("confronted her own motivation," "exchange that certainty for... curiosity"). Filter-verb stacks ("she saw," "she understood," "she felt") cluster in the vision sequence, dulling immediacy. The closing lines recycle scaffold ("The pause had ended; the reply was..."; "humming... as... trees harmonized") without propulsion. Density is low in the three-awakening block, which summarizes rather than advances.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy reliance on stock metaphors and elevated register: "fragile inner flame," "unquenchable fire," "cathedral where converging chaos was…the architecture of liberation." Paraphrase loops appear: the "spark of defiance" motif repeats across lines 102, 194, 204, 220, 242, 278 without fresh detail. Template cadence in the final third ("He was no longer…he was a cartographer," "defiance was not…but a garden") creates rhythmic monotony. Information density is moderate; many sentences restate theme rather than advance action.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths modulate well. Information density is high in the opening and closing thirds. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence in the climactic beats ("tears...saltwater essence of reef-shadow joy," "luminous, dappled happiness born from...interplay," "celebrating the beauty forged in the kiln of waiting"), creating density without always advancing causality. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 15–16 restate the armistice and its resonance with near-synonyms ("acknowledged, honored, woven" / "gentle surrender...hands like old friends"). Template cadence in the resolution paragraphs ("He continued...," "He saw how...," "And as...") flattens momentum. Combined artifacts trigger −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.7)
    Template cadence pervades: "Moving with...," "Closing her eyes...," "She would spend...," "Tomorrow, the light would..."; identical stems stack across beats. Paraphrase loops appear ("deserted marvel" recurs three times as noun phrase without evolving meaning; "gently systematic" echoes twice). Heavy figurative density in non-peak beats ("bittersweet ache where beauty and sorrow are inseparable") without pattern-teaching. Line artifacts and scaffold trigger −1.2 total in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear but carries template patterns: "Her motivation burned with quiet intensity," "Heart hammering, Elara traced," "tears of relief traced warm paths." Stock metaphors and repeated sentence structures ("she felt," "she saw," "she gathered") create a scaffold rhythm. The phrase "cautious exuberance" is repeated three times without functional variation. Information density is moderate; many sentences do single jobs (orient, describe, advance) rather than layering action with subtext or world detail. No major loops or causality breaks, but the figurative language occasionally overreaches ("dust motes danced in the lamplight like notes finding their place").

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "dappled resolve," "mechanical sonnet of protection," "encrypted compassion," "bridge of brass between past intention and present harmony." These elevate texture but sometimes pile up in adjacent sentences (lines 160, 176, 218, 228), risking ornamental overwriting without always advancing causality. Template cadence appears in the opening third (e.g., repetitive "his" + noun constructions). Paraphrase loops are minimal. Clarity remains intact, but the density occasionally slows momentum in non-peak beats. Sentence openings vary adequately; no major artifact obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and several lines carry double duty (meteorite as gift and anchor, dust as historian and ritual). However, paraphrase loops appear: "These paper trails… were his true sanctuary" / "each fragment a desperate attempt to preserve the echo" restates the same content. Template cadence in "He had told… weaving… / But today… shattering… / Grief… threatened…" runs across multiple beats. Figurative language is dense throughout without taught pattern or payoff at closure—"tiny historian," "fragile bloom," "withering soil," "graceful acceptance of the swirl" stack without clear escalation. Line-level clarity is intact but momentum suffers from ornamental phrasing. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence, −0.4 for unearned density.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"breathless space," "featherly determined," "tapestry of understood truths"—without pattern-teaching or visible payoff beyond texture. Adjacent lines paraphrase without added pressure: "The fractured hush was no longer empty silence; it was a tapestry of understood truths" immediately follows "Her featherly determined spirit held firm with acceptance." Template cadence appears in the middle third: multiple paragraphs open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]." These artifacts dull momentum and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Information density is moderate; many lines restate insight rather than advance it. Clarity remains intact, so no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is vivid and sensory-rich with strong imagery (kelp "ghostly," ocean's "slow breath," fireflies as "golden pulse"). However, the piece exhibits paraphrase loops and thematic restatement: "shadowseam wonder" is defined, then re-glossed at closure; "belonging" is explored in three near-identical formulations across the final third. Sentence stems repeat ("She had," "She was," "The facility was/had") without pattern-teaching. Template cadence in the resolution section ("It was the...," "It was the...," "It lived in...") flattens propulsion. These artifacts cluster near closure, triggering the −1.7 baseline deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft shows strong sensory precision ("pearlescent potential," "anxious grey and hopeful silver") and purposeful rhythm variation. Information density is high in testing sequences where glass color, sprout growth, and path appearance layer efficiently. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "missing pieces" recurs across adjacent paragraphs in slight variations without added pressure; "cheerful gloom" is restated multiple times; and the final three paragraphs loop the acceptance-of-release concept ("beauty of release," "graceful passing," "steady lantern") without new texture. Template cadence emerges in mid-section beats: "She tested... Then to... Her method was... Kneeling, Elara placed..." creates a parallel-action rhythm that flattens momentum. Two stock metaphors—"tears like diamonds" and "light catching"—appear in high-stakes beats. Apply standard artifact penalty (−0.6 to −0.8 for loops plus template stems) but the closure image itself remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings show variety. Information density is generally high, integrating action with atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops and template patterns appear: "lightly attentive" recurs without functional variation; "the tide's predictable advance, a monotonous rhythm" is restated as "serenade monotony" and "monotony serenaded" creating synonym churn; stock phrases like "star-dusted wilderness of sky" and "emotional horizons" inflate texture. The final third contains thematic summary ("a duet of human artistry and untamed wilderness") that reduces momentum. These artifacts cluster enough to prevent high-band entry but do not obscure core causality.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several paraphrase loops appear: "not by chains of law, but by a deep gravitational pull toward this sacred soil, a certainty her purpose was rooted here" restates the same idea across a long clause. "Spontaneously anchored" is introduced, then immediately glossed as "not by chains...but by pull," then recapped as "certainty." The final two paragraphs loop thematic summary: "nostalgia ban could erase...but possessed no power..." and "She was anchored not by exile, but by choice" echo each other without new pressure. Template cadence appears in the inscription sequence: "She added...Next, the constellation...Elara completed..." (three parallel openers). Figurative density is high—"obsidian grace" appears twice, "cosmic verse," "gravitational pull," "thermals of purpose"—but mixed metaphors arise: "obsidian grace" (volcanic glass) applied to movement, then to stars; "anchor" shifts from metaphorical weight to literal dissolution. These patterns dull momentum in non-closure beats and touch the final paragraph, triggering artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high, with lines often doing double duty (physical detail plus internal state). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "silent discourse" / "wordless conversation," "noctilucent reckoning" / "silent, luminous truth," and the closing paragraphs recycle "every" constructions ("Every repaired window," "Every cleaned pane") that feel templated. The metaphor density in the pond-reading sequence (rings as stanzas, threads of liquid starlight, aqueous script) borders on overwriting without all vehicles landing clearly. Minor register drift into elevated abstraction ("essence of the place," "endlessly, beautifully illuminated in clear complexity") in peak beats. No major clarity breaks, but momentum drags slightly in the extended closing meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.7)
    Severe template-cadence debt: numerous lines open with "He [verb]" or "The [noun]," and synonym loops recur ("reflecting deeply" appears twice, "gently skilled" twice, "hard softness" twice, "celestial" three times, "innocence" nine times). Paraphrase loops are frequent—paragraphs restate the same insight (innocence transforms, cracks are maps of survival) without added pressure. Abstract diction ("alchemy," "syntax of scars," "universal language") stacks in peak beats, muddling concreteness. Cumulative deductions: template runs −0.6, paraphrase loops −0.4, elevated register drift −0.3, stock metaphor reliance −0.4. The artifacts touch the closure sequence ("scars were not wounds, but words"), triggering the −1.7 artifact-at-closure penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is low; many sentences restate theme rather than advance situation.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("light fractured into liquid gold," "trial balloons—concentrated intentions launched like silent seeds"). Paraphrase loops are minimal. However, several beats restate the same concept across adjacent lines (e.g., lines 176 and 202 both define "serene upheaval") and the final third includes mild template cadence ("She was not a savior, but a gardener..."). Overwriting appears in stacked metaphors (double helix, Fibonacci spiral, pearlescent shells, cobalt/emerald glass) within one ritual beat without clear payoff differentiation. No line-level artifact directly obscures the closure image, so deductions remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies across sentences and paragraphs; opening lines and closing cadence create visual and sonic texture. However, pervasive paraphrase loops and thematic restatements reduce propulsion: "legacy's burden" appears eight times with minor variation, "sensitively perceptive" recurs as a label without new action, and multiple lines restate the same commitment to remembering ("I carry your dreams," "faithful witness," "chart the dreams so they would never fade"). Template cadence appears in repetitive stems: "She [verb]" openings across multiple beats. Stock metaphors ("black mouth of ash," "symphonies of human experience") and elevated diction ("covenant," "weave through stone") occasionally drift from the POV's immediate sensory experience. Apply −1.0 cumulative for loops and scaffold under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap; the final image avoids direct artifact contamination but earlier beats carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("twilight bled into dusk," "echo of a lullaby hummed within the silver"), but several images clash or overreach: "borrowed heartbeat" as "engine of his grace" mixes metaphors, and "liquid hope" in the amber light feels forced. Template cadence appears in the mirror-transformation sequence ("touched by emerald light," "kissed by sapphire light"). Paraphrase loops: "His work was done" and "A profound peace settled" restate closure without adding pressure. The final third carries elevated diction that doesn't modulate with the heartbeat's failure, missing an opportunity for syntactic or rhythmic compression.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several areas show craft debt. Template cadence in "His attribute was operatively gentle... His motivation was redemption... The price of redemption was..." creates a checklist feel in the opening third. Paraphrase loop: "to anchor ideals in practice" appears three times with near-identical phrasing. Stock metaphor: "sigils blooming like dark flowers" and "fury only breeds more ash" lack freshness. Filter-verb stack in "he would muster / he had ordered / he never spoke" flattens immediacy. Figurative density ("less like wood and more like cooled obsidian," "roadmap of old grievances") appears in most lines of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching. No loops touch the closure beat directly, limiting total deduction, but cumulative artifact presence disqualifies 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("sky the color of weathered steel," "cartography of loss"). Information density is high. Two minor issues: paraphrase loop in the charity/amorality exposition (lines 5–7 restate the contradiction without added pressure), and slight overwriting in the convergence beat ("sacred vacuum of sound" + "absolute lull" within three lines). The final image propels cleanly with no scaffold. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence runs. Clarity and concision are strong except for the noted loop. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from high metaphoric density without pattern-teaching or sufficient causal work: nearly every sentence in the opening third deploys figurative language ("crushed pearls upon mercury-hued stone," "silent stanza against suffocating lullaby," "serpents of captured starlight"), obscuring concrete action and slowing momentum. Paraphrase loops appear ("bodily poetic" recurs three times without added meaning; "sigh and smile" appears four times with identical phrasing). Template cadence is present in the untangling sequence: "She began... Her fingers... This untangling... She felt... With fluid grace..." Synonym churn and stock metaphors (syrupy wave, prismatic sparks) cluster in peak beats, reducing clarity. The final paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("alarming serenity," "latent awakening," "unkillable seed") rather than concrete image, dulling the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and figurative language is purposeful in key images (moonlight beam, meteor hush, steel ribs). Information density is high in the first half but drops in the second, where multiple lines paraphrase the same realization ("surrender of ego," "empowered voice," "gentle revolution," "restoration"). Template cadence appears in the final third with repeated "He would" constructions and parallel structures that mechanically iterate rather than advance. The phrase "uncommon serenity" recurs four times without reweighting, and "meteor hush" appears three times, once charged (line 147) and twice decoratively. Minor filter-verb stacks ("he realized," "he envisioned") and synonym churn around "serenity/stillness/resolve" dull momentum in the closure zone, triggering a cumulative −0.8 to −1.0 deduction in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high: "fingers weaving cloud-grass," "spun sugar," "whisper of weight," "shard of moonlight." Many metaphors are vivid yet ornamental, appearing in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Paraphrase loops: "transiently rooted" recurs three times; "blushing stillness" bookends without functional shift. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun] [verb]," flattening rhythm. Line-level clarity holds, but information density sags under decorative phrasing—beats often restate mood rather than advance situation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically varied in the ritual center, with strong concrete nouns ("hemp fibers," "perforations," "braids"). Information density is high during the reconfiguration sequence. However, the final third accumulates minor loops: "snowmelt ardor" appears three times with near-identical framing; "technically gentle" recurs as a label without fresh action; and several lines paraphrase closure ("sound endured," "names safe," "promise kept") across adjacent beats. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase-loop density in the ending and stock metaphor strings ("liquid dawn," "living light"). No filter-verb stacks or register breaks touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades: "bruised clouds," "crystalline sigh," "vibrant tapestry," "profound intimacy," "silent welcome," "sacred circuit." Paraphrase loops appear ("She was no longer merely a walker. She was a conscious thread"). Template stems recur ("She saw... She felt... She understood"). Register drifts into elevated abstraction at peak beats ("transcendence through interpreted dreams," "harmonized into present-moment purpose"). Clarity remains serviceable, but density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance. Final-third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and lower Q7 by −1.4.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.7)
    Severe overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "dusky harmony—indigo sky bleeding into amber horizon," "silent symphony of numbers, light, and answered seeking," "perpetual dawn sealed within his soul." Mixed metaphors abound ("suspended silence mirror his own poised anticipation," "warmth flowed...recognition"). Paraphrase loops recur: three sentences (~para 20–22) restate "covenant sealed through alignment" without advancing pressure. Template cadence: "He would continue...he smiled...he whispered" in the final third. Stock phrases ("weathered face," "soft counterpoint") and synonym churn ("encrypted devotion" ×5, "dusky harmony" ×3) dull momentum. Register drift into abstract diction ("ontological," "empirically ironic") violates the practical astronomer's lexicon. Cumulative artifact debt: −1.4 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is maintained, but line-level density suffers from paraphrase loops ("soundless sanctuary... sound was not merely absent but consumed"; "resentment dissolved like mist, leaving only the clean resonance of love" echoes "no longer serves the heart"). Template cadence in the final third: repeated "The [noun] [past verb]" stems and "Kael [verb]" constructions. Stock metaphors ("like mist," "river of liquid light") and filter-verb stacks ("began to soften," "started to") dull immediacy in peak beats. Figurative language (murmuration, delta) decorates without clear pressure payoff. Aggregate: −0.8 for loops and cadence, −0.3 for stock metaphors = baseline ~6.7, dropped to 5.9 for pervasive spread.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("frost-rimed soil," "tweezers of polished bone," "fog's chill into her lungs"). Information density is generally high. However, the piece exhibits pattern-artifact issues: repeated stems ("She was erasing," "She did not force," "She raised," "She lowered"), paraphrase loops (e.g., boundary-erasing is restated in adjacent beats without added pressure), and elevated metaphor density in every beat of the mending sequence without taught pattern or payoff. The phrase "stitch in the fabric of loss" and "gave sanctuary" border on stock lyricism. The final paragraph stacks three summary-like reflections ("more than an object," "fragment of a broken soul," "glass mountains") that tell rather than anchor the closure in concrete action. Modest penalties for template cadence and paraphrase loops in non-closure beats; the artifacts appear in the final paragraph, triggering the artifact cross-cap.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied syntax and high information density in the repair sequence. However, patterned artifacts cluster: "feisty" appears three times (label repetition), filter-verb stacks ("felt an… resolve kindle," "felt insufficient"), and the final third leans on stock metaphors ("amber tears," "scar tissue," "hopeful flag"). Paraphrase loop in the penultimate paragraph: "the breach of contract was transmuted—not a scar of failure, but the necessary opening" restates the deciduous-vows concept already articulated. Template cadence in early beats ("Above, the skeletal rafters…" / "This vibrant reclamation…" / "Elara, the valley's quartz-eye mender…") and the closing moralizing paragraph dull closure momentum. Baseline −0.8 for clustered artifacts; total deduction ~−1.0 for final-third concentration.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "time was not a river but a tapestry," "liquid planets," "dancing shadows in the starlight." While vivid, the metaphoric load clusters without consistent pattern-teaching, occasionally slowing momentum. Minor paraphrase loop: "bewilderment" appears in the opening, middle ("deep, persistent bewilderment"), and late ("She was no longer bewildered"), recycling the anchor without additive pressure. Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports scene needs. Information density is generally strong, though the bathroom ritual beat ("ritual she relied upon") tells rather than dramatizes the shift. No major clarity breaks, but the persistent elevation in peak beats (final paragraph's "luminous understanding," "sacred trust") trends toward abstraction when concrete action would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.3)
    Sentence openings vary adequately; paragraphs modulate length. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "carefully resourceful" recurs four times without evolving function; "unlearned lessons" cycles through noun and verb forms across adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence is present in the final two paragraphs (repeated "every [noun]" parallel structure, stacked "she [verb]" stems). Stock metaphors cluster: "turning toward dawn," "fireflies," "paths through dust," "melody of redemption." The Warden's description ("woven wood, stitched leather, whispered pages") is vivid but the simultaneous groaning-coalescing action blurs sequence. Figurative density in the closing walk ("whispering corridors," "rustle of pages turning," "sigh of stone," "symphony of what could be") stacks metaphors without clear propulsion, slowing the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and the prose is generally clean, but the piece carries noticeable scaffold and paraphrase loops, especially in the final third: "Unkindled solace was not emptiness; it was space made sacred" closely echoes "To recapture what is lost, unkindle the solace you seek"; "She was the keeper. She was the gardener" follows "She was home" in a template-cadence run. Stock metaphors appear under pressure ("a key turning in a rusted lock," "silence felt like company"). The figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff; many sentences layer metaphor on metaphor ("fog clinging like a shroud," "cathedral of her acceptance") in adjacent lines, reducing clarity. These artifacts do not obscure causality but they dull momentum in the closure beats, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm breathes with the action, but the prose exhibits template cadence in several beats: "She approached... She loosened... She felt... From her satchel, she took..." clusters identical subject-verb stems across the climax. Figurative density is high throughout—"cathedral of measured time," "liquid memory," "watercolor touched by rain"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating mild overwriting. Paraphrase loops appear: "These were meticulous records of voids: the empty chair... the blank page..." restates the concept without added pressure. The Text-Artifact Screen triggers a −0.6 deduction for template stems in the peak beat, and mild figurative muddle adds −0.3, totaling −0.9 within Q7's Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("lacework of fractures," "dawn's inevitability," "healing persuasion," "crucible"), creating tonal uniformity that flattens urgency in peak beats (the stone placement and conjuring). The phrase "gently luminous" appears four times, becoming a verbal tic. Synonym churn is present: "hammered repose," "earned calm," "forged in chaos's crucible" all gesture at the same idea. Paraphrase loops: lines 213–217 restate "bloom of hush" without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "He had found… He had not defeated… He allowed…" These artifacts touch the closure sequence, lowering the score and disallowing 9+ globally per the Q7 rule.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity is generally high and information density adequate. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the pavilion's breath, a constant companion" immediately follows "a vibration woven into the very silica"; "profound stillness" and "absolute silence" redescribe the same effect within two beats. Stock phrases recur: "with the care of a priestess," "unshakable certainty warming her spirit," "tears traced clean paths." The final paragraph stacks multiple restatements of the theme without advancing the image. Figurative language is purposeful in most beats but "thistle-blown hope" is invoked twice without evolving. No major artifacts touch the closure beat directly, but template cadence and synonym churn lower density in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled, with strong sentence variety and high information density in description. However, figurative language saturates most beats ("black river," "alchemized," "stitched response," "tapestry," "crystal whispering," "mother-of-pearl") without tonal modulation, creating a lush uniformity that flattens urgency differentiation. Synonym churn is minimal, but several beats loop conceptually (preemptive nostalgia → resolve transformation is restated three times). The closure paragraph stacks declarative summary lines ("She was the bridge," "the whispering had only just begun") that tell rather than show the reconfiguration, dulling the final image's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level craft is polished with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, but overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the middle third layers figurative language ("liquid memory," "ghost of forgotten laughter," "buoyant weight of purpose") without a taught pattern or payoff structure, triggering density penalties. Paraphrase loops appear ("turned toward the archway, her steps lighter, her chant a steady drumbeat" echoes prior phrasing about chanting and walking). Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("ambient awareness filtered the night's profound silence") that sits uneasily against concrete action beats. These patterns dull momentum and obscure the closure image's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language (starlight fractured, tentacles like petals) is vivid but dense—nearly every sentence in the middle third carries metaphor, risking texture saturation. Paraphrase loops appear: "not emptiness, but fertile ground" echoes "not rejection but his own necessary retreat." Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "A [noun]" across adjacent beats. Information density is high and propulsion steady until the final paragraph, where "witness to this human transition period" over-explains. Clarity remains intact; no causality breaks. Line-level control is strong but figurative density without pattern-teaching lowers momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies with scene pressure; sensory and spatial details are integrated. Overwriting appears in stacked figurative language: "living lattice of silverwood and starlight blossoms," "liquid amber poured over her skin," "honeyed light," "flavors of different silences" cluster without pattern-teaching, reducing clarity in peak beats. Paraphrase loop: "This silence was its opposite: stretching contracted, vast yet intimately close, expanding her chest" restates without added pressure. Template cadence in "Her motivation sharpened: to capture… / Around her, the trellis responded…" stems are noticeable. Information density is high overall, but figurative density in the inversion beat (−0.5) and minor scaffold (−0.3) lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, overwriting accumulates across the piece: nearly every sentence in the opening and middle sections carries figurative language or elevated diction ("cerulean vastness," "luminous water," "languid rhythm," "tender catalyst"), creating density without corresponding pressure escalation. Several phrases loop conceptually: "vaulting hush" appears three times, "in transit" twice, and "storm glass vial" is described in similar terms across multiple beats. Filter verbs and abstract nominalizations appear in high-pressure moments ("Her motivation was not merely to ferry him… but to teach silence how to comfort" and "her patience a tangible anchor"), dulling immediacy. The final paragraph contains template cadence: "The drifting prism terrace continued… a sanctuary where noise was monitored, silence was honored, and comfort was found…" reads as summary rather than scene. Line-level artifacts touch but do not obscure the closure image, routing penalty here per the guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is vivid but overwritten, with figurative density that clogs momentum: "kaleidoscopic waterfall churned in silent symphony, liquid light shifting through hues of forgotten nebulae and drowned sunsets" stacks modifiers without advancing action. Paraphrase loops appear—"chaotic palimpsest of peeling paint layers" is restated as "peel back centuries of deception"—and template cadence runs through the peeling sequence ("She lifted...she uncovered...she worked..."). Stock metaphors ("tears welled," "sweat traced her temples," "weight...lifted...like mist") flatten peak beats. The final paragraph's moralizing summary ("The legacy returned not to a throne, but to soil, song, and shared remembrance") reads like scaffolding rather than image-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors stacked in nearly every sentence ("loaded emptiness," "tender shadow keeper," "shy, sentient smoke," "woven light reinforcing dissolving edges"). Several passages loop conceptually: the sanctuary described multiple times as both refuge and classroom, "loaded emptiness" restated as "spacious quiet." Template cadence is minimal, but the reliance on abstract metaphor over concrete action dulls propulsion in high-pressure beats (the link itself is told via metaphor rather than shown through specific sensation). Sentence variety is present, but clarity suffers under the figurative load, particularly in the climactic linking sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in sensory passages (the farm's glow, the bolt's texture). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "pressure into diamonds" is restated in several forms across paragraphs, "quantum promise" recurs as a label without added pressure, and "shadowseam wonder" is both defined and re-declared. Template cadence in the Convergence sequence: "A profound silence fell... Heat bloomed... the bolt was gone. In its place rested..." follows a predictable pattern. The phrase "virtuously mischievous" is explained twice in similar terms (spore constellations, "that same spirit"). Filter-verb reliance is moderate ("She felt," "She channeled") but does not stack in high-pressure beats. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; minor muddle: "captured nebula" for a root.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with many lines doing double duty (e.g., "the cold brass of the gramophone crank handle resting in her palm like a fallen promise"). However, the prose exhibits figurative density in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without clear pattern-teaching: "golden shadows," "fossilized echo of resonance," "bridge of intuition," "standing waves of courage." Several metaphors blur specificity ("truth resonates in standing waves" mixes acoustic physics with abstraction), and phrases like "eloquently silent" and "dynasty ender" appear as labels rather than dramatized traits. Paraphrase loops occur: the concepts of silence, intuition, and standing waves are restated multiple times without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the final third: "She had crossed... She was... She placed... She ran... She understood..." Deductions: figurative density without payoff −0.6, mixed metaphor −0.4, template cadence in closure zone −0.5, total −1.5 applied once in Q7. Additionally, the final-third template run disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.2)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the opening and climax stacks metaphor or elevated modifier without propulsion or clarity gain. Mixed metaphors abound (glass panes as leviathan ribs, mercury fountain frozen mid-cascade, light as "swirling nebula"). Template cadence ("His motivation burned," "The program was factually mystical," "This was bliss of connection") and synonym loops ("murmured allegiance" appears five times) flatten momentum. Paraphrase loops recur: the vow is recounted twice in adjacent paragraphs with minimal new information. Filter-verb stacks ("felt its truth resonate," "felt shivering bliss") dull immediacy. Artifacts in the climax (the "shivering bliss" and "radiant openness" labels) obscure what Kael actually experiences. The piece prioritizes texture over clarity and propulsion, violating Q7's density and momentum standards.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, the piece suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence. The final third recycles stems: "She knew her work..." / "She would ensure..." / "Walking into the cool night..." Synonym churn appears in adjacent lines: "mended stitch by careful stitch" / "mending begin within her, a stitching." Figurative density crowds peak beats without pattern-teaching: "compass," "sanctuary," "seeds in barren soil," "page waiting for gentle hands" stack in the closure without earned connection. Filter-verb clusters ("felt," "knew," "imagined") dull immediacy in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the lagoon sequence; no major grammatical errors or continuity breaks. However, paraphrase loops and thematic restatements accumulate: "hold the line" / "the line was held," "revised histories" appears six times, "tyranny of indifference" twice in identical phrasing, and "truth" / "reappear" / "coded freedom" cycle without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third ("She had chosen… She had used… She took… She turned") and filter-verb stacks ("she studied," "she followed," "she carried," "she felt") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Applying −0.8 total for loops and stems touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory imagery is vivid ("dewdrops formed on their tips," "light dancing with the perpetual mist"). Information density is high in the performance sequence: each note and pause advances the ritual causally. However, patterned phrasing recurs: "steeped in" appears twice ("cabin steeped in a silence," "journey steeped in eerie nostalgia"), "quietly vivid" twice (element tag, then "quietly vivid image"), and template stems proliferate ("He dressed," "He stepped," "He remembered," "He lifted," "He played," "He offered," "He poured," "He watched," "He packed"). The stem-repetition across the first half and the doubled phrases trigger −0.5 in Q7 under the template-cadence and paraphrase-loop checks. Peak beats (the performance itself) are clearer and more propulsive, avoiding artifact contamination at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.1)
    Phrase recycling is pervasive: "mossy delight" appears five times, "tiny monument to forgotten things" twice, "ashen" three times, "hush" four times, creating a templated cadence. Paraphrase loops appear ("The message resonated clearly" immediately follows the stated realization). Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff: "quiet fire," "sacred pursuit," "cascade of emotion," "dissolve into starlight" stack in adjacent lines. Sentence stems repeat ("She caught," "She placed," "She glanced," "She would build"). These artifacts dull the closure image and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−1.4 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally).

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and rhythm are generally strong, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and thematic echo in the final third: "she had learned to move with its currents" repeats the waterfall metaphor already embodied in the needle's behavior, and "the deepest form of navigation" restates what the stone placement shows. Stock metaphor strings appear: "ache of things out of sync," "calm acceptance," "beautiful, necessary space." Template cadence recurs in the workshop-return sequence with parallel "She now understood" and "She placed" constructions. The opening and middle maintain density, but the closure beat is diluted by summary that the scene has already delivered.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.8)
    Heavy overwriting pervades the piece: nearly every sentence deploys figurative or elevated language ("liquid obsidian," "molten forgiveness," "tapestry of luminous golden veins"), creating density without information gain and obscuring momentum. Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "the weight of names" recurs across multiple paragraphs without added pressure; "luminous regret" appears verbatim four times as label rather than dramatization. Template cadence runs through the middle third with repeated "She [verb]" stems. Register drifts into academic abstraction ("philosophy of kintsugi intentions," "factually mystical truth") that clashes with the POV's immediacy. These artifacts dull the closure image and reduce propulsion throughout. Applying −1.4 for combined density overload, paraphrase loops, and template cadence; an additional −0.3 for filter-verb stacks in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.5)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and imagery is vivid ("pale gold light bled softly," "spiderweb catching dawn light"). However, pervasive figurative density without pattern-teaching creates overwriting: nearly every sentence in the opening and climax carries metaphor or elevated diction, blurring momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "spectral confessions" is named four times across beats without functional variation. Template cadence in the climax: "Her spectral confessions were not erased but cradled… 'I remember her laughter'… 'Thank you for weaving it back'…" stacks summary-tell over show. Filtering: "Elara listened," "Elara sat," "she felt" recur without voice necessity. These artifacts cluster in closure beats, triggering −0.8 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive overwriting in high-pressure beats: "consciousness returned in sharp, granular increments," "stellar intensity," "mycelial networks feeding trees." Figurative density appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.5. Template cadence runs pervade: "He brace... he brace... he brace" (verb error repeated, likely generation artifact); "The strap gleamed... Kael moved... one step, one memory, one act" (mechanical triad). Paraphrase loops cluster: lines restate "displaced yet rooted," "tools of pain repurposed for liberation," and "mathematics of mercy" without added pressure. Mixed register: clinical terms ("Mercy_Coefficient_01," "topological pathways") clash with lyric constructions ("luminous wilderness demanding his authentic presence"). Apply −1.2 cumulative for artifacts, plus −0.3 for the repeated verb error touching multiple beats. These artifacts dull the closure image and disallow 9+ globally per the filter-verb/template-cadence rule.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense yet legible. However, overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: "eternal instant" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment, and the penultimate paragraph stacks metaphors ("layered with silent narratives," "whispers of forgotten hands") that blur rather than sharpen the closure image. Template cadence in the final two paragraphs (repeated "another... another... another") and paraphrase loops ("the market faded... but its purpose remained") flatten momentum. Cumulative artifacts in the ending third trigger penalty and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and momentum are strong; each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. However, the prose suffers from pattern repetition and overwriting in key beats. Runs of identical sentence stems appear throughout ("His attribute...engaged," "His gaze lifted," "His calloused fingers found," "His form softened"), creating template cadence. Figurative density peaks at closure ("golden motes drifting like dandelion seeds," "tiny sun against his leg") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff. The dust-reading method is vivid, but several lines ("profound silence," "sorrowful luminescence," "weightless burden") rely on stock phrasing. These artifacts lower information density and dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong imagery (glass orchard, frost mandala, bottled whisper). Information density is high in descriptive passages but lower in action beats. Minor loop: "The library was a masterpiece of balanced reality, a fragile ecosystem of stories held in perfect stasis" and "Her actions, however precise, introduced entropy—a necessary chaos" paraphrase the destabilization concept within adjacent lines (−0.2). Template-cadence check passes. Figurative density in peak beats (rupture sequence) is moderate and coherent. No filter-verb stacks or major artifacts; propulsion is adequate though not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.6)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "baroque asteroid," "labyrinth of gilded cherubs," "slow-drifting amber rivers," "polished ache of vindication," "burnished into reverence" stack figurative language without respite. Paraphrase loops appear ("tears traced warm paths"/"tears glistening"; "time's reflection becomes a liar"/"time-filaments resolved"). Template cadence: "Elara had fulfilled…she reimagined…she placed…" in the final third. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("defunct revolutionary," "profound poetic inclination," "cognate streams") that clashes with immediate action. Artifacts touch the closure sequence, triggering the cap and disallowing 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "He sang of balance, shadow giving meaning to light, all things having their honest season" immediately after "a song of radical acceptance...leaves releasing branches without regret, rivers flowing to the sea." Stock metaphors saturate the climax: "river of dawn," "rushing back along the song-path," "universe sighing relief." Template cadence runs appear in the middle third: "He sang...He sang...The tether..." Figurative density ("liquid gold," "verdigris luminescence," "molten gold") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff, and the final paragraph stacks summary: "exhausted yet filled with abiding peace...honored, and the world turned once more with grace." Apply loop/scaffold penalty −1.0 and figurative muddle −0.5; artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. The opening and closing images are strong anchors. However, several paraphrase loops and synonym clusters appear: "resonant hush" recurs four times across the text; "wonder," "awe," and "ineffable" cluster in the final third; "truth" / "truthful" / "truths" appears in tight succession. Template cadence in adjacent lines ("She had studied… She had delved… She would not take… She carried no artifact…") creates a drumbeat in the closing paragraphs. These artifacts do not obscure causality but do reduce propulsion and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−0.6 to −0.8 in Q7). Clarity remains high; no grammar errors.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high, but overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the carving sequence layers metaphor ("covenant across decades," "turbine-hum reverie," "whispered dialogue with wood and memory"). Template cadence appears in parallel stems: "This hum was the anchor…" / "This slide embodied…" / "This alliance was tangible…" / "This was reimagination…" Paraphrase loops recur: "the archway was shelter, celestial observatory, and threshold" restates across multiple beats without added pressure. The phrase "timewoven alliances" and variations appear six times, often without dramatized action. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt compelled," "she saw Anya vividly") dull immediacy. Information density is moderate; many lines do two jobs, but scaffolding and synonym churn lower propulsion. No loops touch the closure beat directly, capping deductions at −1.4 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, multiple passages lean into decorative phrasing: "honey-tinted glass walls cast the interior in a perpetual, nostalgic glow," "the sky bled from indigo to rose," "her wool shawl whispering against stone." Several adjacent sentences in the revelation beat paraphrase the same insight (flowers honor moon's cool luminescence / covenant of trust with compassionate dark / lesson in valuing tender phases). Template stems recur: "She [verb]" opens five sentences in the final third. Figurative language in most lines of the climax without clear pattern-teaching: −0.5 for density and −0.3 for paraphrase loops = −0.8 total within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the prose carries overwriting in peak beats: "searing reverie," "violent immersion," "profound relief," "archival certainty"—elevated diction that stacks rather than sharpens. The opening and vision sequences are vivid, yet scaffolding appears in phrases like "the core concept of the discovery was no mere academic exercise" and "this was the tension he sought to resolve," which announce rather than dramatize. No loops or major artifacts obscure causality, but figurative density in high-pressure moments ("swallow the starlight," "wave of profound relief") tilts toward glossy metaphor without pattern-teaching or payoff. The closure beat is clean of major slips.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "conception was complete, a living vision held firm in her mind's eye" is summary after abstract claim. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "anchors dragging her into despair," "mental crucible," "honest light," "cradle" in final lines. Paraphrase loops appear: "the conception was complete" echoes "clarity crystallized within her"; "embodying their wisdom, not repeating their magic" is restated across multiple beats. Template cadence is visible in the closing sequence: "Each future lantern... And in that promise... Paper-Lantern Cove would breathe..." Scaffold phrases dull momentum rather than propel. Apply −0.8 for density and loops touching closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("velvet disquiet," "pulled her under its current," "canvas for nascent emotions"). However, several beats suffer from paraphrase loops: "archive the subtle emotional patterns woven into sound" echoes "archive emotional patterns" and "emotional patterns...were seeds" within short spans. Template cadence appears in the final third with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" openings across four consecutive paragraphs. Minor filter-verb stack ("felt the silence," "Closing her eyes, she willed") in the opening does not severely dull immediacy but adds to cumulative line debt. No opacity at closure, but −0.8 for paraphrase and template artifacts across non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled; sentence openings vary and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "motes of light," "cold, sharp pinpricks," "star-dusted vault," "liquid light," "river of time's flowing river," "tiny bell." Mixed metaphor in "texture of borrowed time: smooth cool certainty of a river stone, rough fibrous hope of bark, fleeting warmth of sunbeam" stacks vehicles without coherence. Repetitive stock phrasing: "wild serenity" appears three times, "furiously tranquil" twice, "borrowed time" six times. Template cadence in the ritual sequence: "She felt... She understood... She gathered... She saw..." Filter-verb stack in final third lowers immediacy. Line-level artifacts touch closure (the final smile described as "furiously tranquil expression"), applying the higher deduction range and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high (most lines do double duty: setting + choice, memory + cost). Clarity is strong. However, three paraphrase loops appear: "solstice hush" recurs five times with minimal reweighting until the final third; "favor listening over noise" appears three times nearly identically; and "decades of expectation/meticulous data" cycles without added nuance mid-story. Template cadence in cumulative markers (e.g., "cumulative: X") are scaffolding tokens and ignored per rubric, but internal synonym churn ("profound solstice hush," "sacred stillness," "lingering solstice hush") within peak beats triggers −0.6. No figurative muddle. Strong propulsion overall, but the repetition dulls momentum slightly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose carries lyric rhythm and vivid images ("silver scar across the heavens," "liquid gold"), but pervasive figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching, creating density that slows rather than propels (−0.5). Paraphrase loops recur: "flourishing stillness" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure; "vulnerability" and "strength" cycle through synonym variants (−0.4). Template cadence runs appear in the middle third ("The station…," "The hush…," "He…") with identical stems (−0.4). Stock metaphors (dust motes as stars, heart as tuning fork) lack fresh specificity. Information density is uneven—beats often do two jobs (setting + interiority) but repeated thematic assertions ("not weakness but sacred space") add scaffolding rather than momentum. Combined artifact and loop penalties total approximately −1.3 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and often vivid ("circular stone walls sheltering skeletal apiaries," "translucent hand near the broken gate"). Information density is high in the opening and closure beats. However, multiple lines paraphrase the same content: the recluse's method of reading contextual clues is stated, restated, and exemplified across several paragraphs without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in accumulative lists ("harsh criticism born of fear, Anya's tearful dawn departure, Elias's nightly crafted apologies"). Stock phrases recur: "weight of unspoken words" (×3), "tranquilly perceptive" (×2), "mute eloquence" (×2). These loops and scaffolding dull momentum mid-story, though the final sequence tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor well. Information density is high in the timeless-sea passage. However, figurative language saturates most sentences ("hairline fractures spiderwebbing," "silent sea," "breathing tapestry," "pollen on the wind," "threads of borrowed time") without respite, creating texture overload in peak beats. Paraphrase loops: lines 140 and 148 restate Kael's clarity with near-synonym churn ("clarity flooded him" / "his final act must extend this understanding"). Template cadence: "He felt... He sought... He carried..." stem repetition across multiple beats. Artifacts touch the closure third, triggering the −1.7 baseline and the 9+ disallow.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity and grammar are sound. However, overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats (kite fall, feather handling, writing) carries figurative language ("sharp *twang* shattered," "feather...humming with wild sky-memory," "anointed it her quill," "words flowed"). Density penalty applies (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: the concept of harmonizing discord is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure ("harmonizing its discord into verse," "let it deepen the dawn she crafted"). Template cadence in the closing section ("She had not erased...she had listened," "walking home, her warmly attentive spirit felt") adds −0.4. Stock metaphors ("thread by fragile thread," "weaving gold through breaks") in the final third add −0.3. Total artifact deductions: approximately −1.2, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high in wrapping-process beats; sensory detail advances atmosphere and choice. Rhythm varies naturally in early sections. Final third suffers template cadence: multiple adjacent sentences open with subject-verb-object in identical structure ("Kael smiled," "Kael closed his eyes," "He had remodeled"), and paraphrase loops appear ("fostering respect through action, not words" / "covenant through humility" / "quiet reciprocity"). These patterns dull the closure image's propulsion. Figurative language is controlled except for minor mixed vehicle: stone "sigh" and wood "shiver" coexist without clear shared logic. Deductions: template cadence −0.6, paraphrase loops −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and carries vivid sensory detail (obsidian stones gleaming, petrichor and lilac, resin dust). However, the piece suffers from pervasive scaffold and loop issues: "academically rebellious" appears three times, "bronze quiet" four times, "luminous skeptic" twice; "footprints" and "convergence" recur without functional reweighting. Template cadence appears in sequential exposition: "This was the method... This was not cosmic sentiment... This resin..." Figurative language clusters in non-pressure beats ("honey-colored tear," "weeping angel," "couriers preserving essence") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Information density is low in the final third, where exposition summarizes theme rather than advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear and carries vivid sensory detail, but line-level momentum suffers from overwriting and decorative density. Runs of elevated modifiers appear in most sentences of key beats without pattern-teaching or payoff: "narrow ribbon of weathered wood defiantly cradling," "the ghost of a flower that had never known war," "a riot of color, a blooming bridge between sorrow and solace." Mixed metaphor: "a persistent argument for peace written in chlorophyll and light" stacks incompatible vehicles (argument, written, chlorophyll). Paraphrase loops: "He had not come to erase the past, but to amend it" is followed immediately by "letting beauty grow over brutality...honoring the scar while transforming its meaning"—adjacent lines restating the same idea without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the bird-call beats: "A plover's sharp cry...translated instantly" → "A cormorant croaked...it intoned" → "A flock of sandpipers erupted...forming a precise sentence." Register drifts into corporate/academic phrasing ("stitching harmony into a fractured world," "a living memorial"). Apply Overwriting Checks: density −0.5, coherence (mixed metaphor) −0.4, register drift −0.4; Paraphrase-loop check −0.2; Template-cadence check −0.5. Total artifact penalty −2.0 in Q7, plus the final-third presence of these artifacts disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; the opening paragraph does four jobs (character, setting, object, motivation). Clarity is strong. Two areas of concern: "wild hush" appears six times, risking decorative repetition; the phrase "intuitively descriptive" is told twice rather than shown consistently. The final paragraphs compress into fragments ("A direction. A destination. A breath away.") which accelerates rhythm purposefully. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "echoed silence" recurs five times across the piece without meaningful variation; "true north" is restated in three consecutive beats near the end with only slight rewording. Template cadence in the final third ("She would return...," "She would map...," "She was no longer...") creates a declarative drumbeat that flattens propulsion. The closure beat itself remains clear, so these artifacts are routed here rather than Q2, capping the score under 7.0 per the loop-check guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence variety and rhythm are solid; the swapping beats build momentum through parallel structure without becoming mechanical. Information density is high—each line advances the sequence or charges the setting. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "sacredly playful reverence" (line 87) echoes "sacredly playful amendment" (line 255); "cautious abandon" is named twice (lines 146, 271) and explained rather than shown through syntax or choice. Stock metaphors ("muscles burning but spirit alight," "tears froze on Kael's cheeks") and a few abstract nouns ("embodied," "reverence," "wonder") dilute immediacy in peak beats. The final paragraph stacks thematic labels ("reverence," "unknown dawn," "apprentice of wonder") where image alone would suffice. No severe artifacts or loops, but the accumulation of template phrases and conceptual redundancy across the ending prevents entry into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is grammatically clean with vivid imagery and controlled rhythm. However, density is low: adjacent lines frequently restate the same content ("not echoes of the past, but a living chorus" / "the nomadic penumbra were no longer shadows but vessels"). Template cadence appears in the spelling sequences ("She walked 'mend'... 'Shield'... 'Light'"). Stock metaphors populate peak beats: "moths to a fragile flame," "breath and light," "fertile ground." The final paragraph stacks summary claims ("The unbinding was complete; the small gestures were free") rather than trusting the image to land.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level clarity is strong with varied syntax and high information density. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the "shape of home" motif. However, several ornamental constructions slow momentum: "the impossibly soft barbules whispered comfort, the resilient quill promised strength, the asymmetrical vanes echoed life's beautiful imperfections" stacks three parallel metaphors in one beat without escalation. The phrase "the hidden thunder of suppressed sorrow" is repeated across paragraphs (lines 215, 304) as a thematic anchor, bordering on loop. Minor filter-verb clustering ("she felt the emotional history") in the talents-surfacing beat. No major artifacts touch closure, so deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent, but nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated phrasing, creating a uniform lyric cadence that can dull momentum: "woven hush," "gilded cage," "grandmaster evaluates," "thread of spun moonlight," "symphony warm and unbroken." Mixed metaphor risk appears in "winnow truth from ruin" (agricultural image) paired with "grandmaster evaluates pawn structures" (chess) within adjacent beats. Several paraphrase loops: "not victory, but absolution" / "not for conquest, but for protection" / "not passive, but earned" recycle the negation-contrast template. Line-level clarity is generally good, but information density is moderate—many lines do one job (description or metaphor) rather than two. Template cadence appears in the reflection block: "Each thread was a move… each knot a lesson." No major grammatical errors; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "towers of bone—rib cages and spines of ancient leviathans—rose like petrified prayers against a bruised dawn sky" stacks figurative language without pattern-teaching. Template cadence runs across multiple paragraphs ("She did not accuse; she refracted" / "A ripple… The echoes…" / "Another stanza…"). Paraphrase loops appear ("not as a monument to blame, but a canvas awaiting truth" restates prior material). Stock metaphors ("tears cutting paths through dust") and label-only traits ("innocently mischievous" x3) recur. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("the pale spire standing witness to grace earned through fractured light"), triggering the −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled through most beats. Information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, the final third accumulates paraphrase loops: "Meaning had been conjured. Oblivion's edge was no longer…" / "Uncertainty dissolved, replaced by…" / "he carried an indestructible sanctuary within—a truth meticulously quilted…" restates closure across three consecutive moves without advancing pressure. Template stems ("He began," "He quilted," "This chip is," "This gold is") cluster in the middle third but remain voice-motivated. The loops in the closure zone trigger −0.6 and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("delicate universe of reflected light," "grief is a treacherous guide," "ocean's roar a rhythmic pulse") and some metaphors strain coherence—"intimately aloof" contradicts itself without clear payoff, and "liquid starlight" + "bioluminescent algae" + "constellations" stack redundantly in adjacent beats. Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" and "He [verb]" openings across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops: "temporary eternity was not a paradox, but truth" immediately follows the shell as "vessel of his promise…temporary eternity of their love," restating the concept without added pressure. Artifacts cluster in the final third, lowering momentum and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is moderate; many lines do lyric work but some scaffold could be cut.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, sensory detail is vivid, and the prose carries high information density in the opening and vial-release beats. However, the second half exhibits synonym churn ("purified intention," "vibrations of intent," "frequency of screaming tenderness" cycling across adjacent lines) and conceptual paraphrase loops that dull momentum. The phrase "screaming tenderness" appears three times in the final third, once as exposition ("the most profound calls are whispered with screaming tenderness"), which reads as thematic scaffolding rather than dramatized image. Line 163's "silent whisper" is oxymoronic ornament. These patterns lower Q7 into mid-6s despite strong opening craft.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is high and sensory detail is specific (patina bronze, verdigris, rosin). However, paraphrase loops proliferate: "geography of loss" appears in lines 3, 11, 22, 29 with minimal variation; "raw solace" in lines 12, 15, 23, 31 similarly churns. Template cadence runs dominate the final third: "The [noun] was [state]... [noun] were [state]..." across six consecutive sentences (lines 21–26). Figurative density ("mosaic of salvaged parts mirroring fractured landscape," "copper threads through geography") appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats without payoff. Bracket counts ([11, total 23]) are scaffolding tokens but do not obscure causality. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence, −0.4 for figurative muddle in peak beats; total −1.2 in Q7, plus disallow 9+ globally per artifact-in-final-third rule.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but paraphrase loops appear: "fractured grace" recurs four times without evolution, and the final third cycles through synonymous declarations of purpose ("this was necessary," "this was love," "this was an act of fractured grace"). Template cadence in the closing paragraphs ("The antique glass eye, once...now held," "And in the fractured light...") flattens propulsion. Figurative language is controlled except for the stacked metaphors around "fractured grace" that blur rather than sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is often vivid ("nautical twilight softened the sea and sky into a seamless bruise of violet and silver"), yet the piece suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and thematic restatemements in the final third: "witnessed isolation" recurs in multiple forms, and the concept of "gaps" is re-explained across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the closing paragraphs: "He was keeper of the beam, yes, but also keeper of silent stories" followed by "The beam swept on, a promise in the dark, and Silas stood watch." Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, though "a seamless bruise" and "the color of forgotten bone" edge toward decorative. Information density is high early but thins as reflection predominates; the final six paragraphs largely restate the closure insight rather than advance it.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the cavern sequence. Minor paraphrase loop: "It was a blooming cavern at midsummer" is immediately followed by descriptive unpacking without added pressure. Template cadence in the resolution: "He remained a keeper of maps, yet now knew..." and "Emerging, he saw the creek receding, the midsummer storm passing" fall into parallel construction that feels scaffolded. Stock metaphor: "Time became a tightening coil" is generic. No severe loops, but the final paragraph's summary voice ("decades-long loneliness replaced by resonant connection") tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is lush and rhythmically controlled, but density issues accumulate. Stock metaphors ("a steady flame in her chest," "starlight in her veins") and elevated diction ("latent energy," "luminous sorrow," "star-forged purpose") appear in most beats without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops: "bleeding starlight" is named, described, then re-explained; "disenchantment" is declared, then "washed away" with minimal bridge. Template cadence: "She discarded… began the arduous action… the path was treacherous… her inherent attribute" reads scaffolded. Filter-verb stacks ("She understood then," "She stepped inside," "She witnessed") dull immediacy. Apply −0.8 for density and loop issues in Q7; artifacts touch closure ("starlight in her veins"), so disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean but burdened by thesis-like abstraction ("the precise chemistry of pigment had harmonized with the spontaneous truth of human connection") and repeated metaphoric scaffolding (density, resolve, palette, directed spontaneity). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She had not altered…but revealed"; "To revalue…was to honor…while gifting"). Stock metaphors cluster: "shoulders tight with unspoken weight," "voice fractured the silence," "heart swelled." Filter-verb stacks ("felt the density," "knowing alchemy's highest art") dull immediacy in key beats. The final paragraph loops thematic claims rather than advancing image or action, triggering −0.6 to −0.8 for scaffold and proximity to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor scaffold: "As a lucid dream chronicler, Elias had dedicated his existence to mapping sleep's fluid landscapes" explains rather than dramatizes. "A hot, corrosive jealousy surged within him—the precise method by which the feral nostalgia chose to manifest its pain" is meta-commentary mid-beat. The final paragraph's "beautiful, chaotic, human" list feels slightly ornamental. Figurative language is dense ("arrows," "discarded quiver," "old fishing line") but mostly integrated. No loops or template cadence. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high; most sentences layer image, interiority, and thematic resonance. Rhythm varies purposefully, with water-clock drips providing sonic structure. However, the piece carries mild overwriting: "liquid time," "brass gears and flowing water," "trembling calm," and "sacred threshold" cluster in adjacent beats without pattern-teaching, creating figurative density that slows momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "the ordinary miracle" recurs three times across the final third, and "trembling calm" is repeated verbatim. Template cadence in reflective beats: "She realized… She understood… And in that understanding…" stacks identically. Apply −0.6 for figurative density and loops, −0.3 for cadence runs = −0.9 total.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "The scars warmed, glowing with soft light as they shifted, flowing like liquid starlight" restates transformation across two clauses without added detail. Template cadence in the final third: "She stood tall... She was ready..." Figurative density in the closure beat ("liquid starlight," "luminous map of survival," "stories etched in light") clusters without full coherence—starlight and etchings mix metaphors. Rhythm varies purposefully elsewhere, and no major scaffolding obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is vivid ("jasmine bloomed instantly," "tears tracing paths through spectral dust"). However, multiple paraphrase loops and scaffold artifacts appear: "This moment is not about saving what is lost... It is about honoring the song it left behind" restates the prior tree/autumn metaphor; "imperfect miracle" is invoked three times without added pressure; "profound" recurs in "profound hush," "profound sorrow," "profound reconnection." Template cadence: "She uncorked... She settled... She rose" across beats. Figurative density in peak beats ("sonic currents," "floorboards and archived sheets," "vapor," "final lingering chord") occasionally muddles rather than clarifies. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("imperfect miracle was flawed, human, and perfect enough"), lowering line-level control despite strong individual images.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high, but patterned artifacts appear: "journeying inward" and "walking out" loop across multiple beats with near-identical phrasing, and "resounding hush" recurs four times as a stock phrase. Template cadence is evident in the repeated structure "At [location], [word] [action]" across the spiral turns. Filter verbs ("felt resolve deepen") occasionally dull immediacy. These artifacts cluster in the middle third but do not obscure the closure image, so deduction remains moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere, ritual, or insight. Rhythm varies purposefully, with shorter beats during the countdown. However, repetitive sentence stems appear: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or begin beats with "He [verb]," creating mild template cadence. Figurative language is dense—"razor edges," "watercolor wash," "silver tear," "star-dusted stillness"—without always serving propulsion; some images feel decorative. The paraphrase loop at the ending ("fjord quiet" recurs three times in final paragraphs) slightly dulls momentum. No major clarity breaks, but cumulative minor slips prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically controlled, with some strong images (mica pane "thin as breath, strong as memory"). However, the text suffers from pervasive scaffold and paraphrase loops: "traverse" appears eight times, often in near-identical constructions; "clover melancholy" is named and re-explained multiple times without new pressure; and several beats restate content ("She would traverse… Moving through… Descending…" all narrate transit without advancing knowledge or choice). Figurative density in non-peak beats (ghostly steam invitation, compass metaphor) and therapy-speak labels at closure ("responsible curiosity," "synthesis") dull momentum and trigger the patterned-artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("loop isn't imprisonment—it's the condition for the song"). Yet paraphrase loops appear: "teach endings how to begin" is restated three times across the story, and "melodically haunted" is both shown and then re-labeled in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence appears in the opening cumulative markers (not story text, generation artifact), but within the prose itself runs of "Her X, her Y" and "no longer X but Y" recur. The final third leans on summary ("felt less like," "now the tunnel's symphony") rather than concrete image, dulling momentum. No filter-verb stacks or major clarity breaks, but accumulated scaffold and loops apply −0.8 under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap, preventing entry to 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high and most sentences advance ritual, memory, or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the weight of small moments" is restated three times across the piece, and "gently thorough" appears nearly identically in multiple sentences. Template cadence is present in the ritual beats ("She lit… heated… placed…" / "She opened… traced… recalled…"). The final third contains conceptual redundancy (preservation/transformation/honoring stated multiple times). Figurative language is mostly clear but "haunted euphoria" and "covenant regenerated… through proximate causes" repeat without evolving. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems concentrated in ritual sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory images ("sunlight fractured through centuries of emerald vines"). However, several patterns accumulate: paragraph-level paraphrase loops (e.g., paragraphs explaining reciprocity restate the same concept with synonym churn—"not charity, but a perfect circle of giving" / "reciprocity was the catalyst" / "bound to each other"). Template cadence in exposition: "Her motivation... drove her" / "She armored herself" / "This station was her sanctuary" follows a repetitive subject-verb-object stem across adjacent lines. The closure sequence over-explains: three consecutive paragraphs articulate theme ("The cure was the act of connection itself" / "Its power is in passing it on" / "The cure was never a destination") rather than trusting the image. Figurative language is vivid but occasionally strained ("gratitude a quiet revolution"). Filter verbs and abstract nouns ("hollow loneliness," "resonant warmth") dilute immediacy at peak beats. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence in the thematic resolution; −0.3 for filter-verb reliance in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; the read-aloud test passes. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The ring pulsed warmer" / "The ring's heat became a steady quiet blaze" restate the same content across three beats without added pressure. Template cadence: "Her skin absorbed…" / "She absorbed…" / "This absorption…" recurs six times, flattening rhythm. Stock metaphor "quiet blaze" is reused four times without evolving meaning. Artifacts do not obscure closure but accumulate to −0.8 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity is generally high and grammar clean. Major issues: pervasive synonym churn and paraphrase loops. "Strange comfort" is restated five times with minor variation; "contingent relationships" recurs as scaffolding across multiple paragraphs; "threshed meaning" cycles through adjacent beats without added detail. Template cadence in the final third: runs of "She had [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" structures across six consecutive sentences flatten rhythm. Figurative density is high throughout ("pooled like spilled ink," "clay not stone," "golden threads," "loom," "web") without pattern-teaching, and mixed vehicles clash (threshing grain vs. weaving loom vs. compass). These artifacts dull momentum and touch closure beats, triggering the artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.2)
    Clarity is maintained and sentences are grammatically clean, but the prose suffers from pervasive overwriting and template cadence. Runs of "He signed... He signed..." and synonym loops ("luminous harbor," "pearl-bright moon," "liquid silver") create rhythmic monotony. Figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff, and stock phrases ("gnarled hand," "breath caught," "tears blurred") dull specificity. The phrase "joyful sorrow" recurs five times as a thematic label rather than being dramatized through action. Paraphrase loops and elevated diction in peak beats (the duet, the ending) obscure rather than sharpen the emotional charge, triggering cumulative line-level penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, but the prose suffers from figurative overload in peak beats: "volcanic tenderness," "tears, hot as embers yet gentle as dew," "geothermal warmth of compassion." These mixed metaphors (volcanic, embers, dew, geothermal) compete rather than cohere. Paraphrase loops appear: the contrast between destruction and reconstruction is restated across multiple paragraphs without adding pressure. Template cadence ("Each creation was," "Each tone an act of") flattens momentum. The closing paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense, creating a lyric texture that serves the accumulative design. However, several lines loop conceptually: "auroral sorrow" appears three times with only slight variation, and the rebellion/quiet rebellion pairing recurs without adding new pressure. The phrase "drumming on everything" is repeated almost verbatim, and stock constructions like "tears traced silent paths" and "chest heaving" appear in high-pressure beats. The closure paragraph stacks declarative summaries ("He had not restored… but proven… The auric lagoon held…") that flatten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and thematic echo weaken momentum: "whispers travel farther than shouts" / "A shout creates chaos. A whisper finds the fold" / "subtlety carried farther than force." Template cadence runs appear: "He whispered again...He saw...He offered...He inserted...He said." The final paragraph summarizes rather than trusts the image: "quiet affirmation," "enduring power," "lesson etched." Figurative language occasionally stacks without adding pressure: "guiding filament woven through steel canyons."

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at closure, longer lyric passages earlier). Clarity is high; no pronoun confusion or spatial drift. However, figurative density is excessive in non-peak beats: "smoothed river stone," "fractured reflections," "silt in deep water," "polished obsidian" cluster in the opening without advancing pressure. "Spiralingly calm" recurs three times without reweighting. Paraphrase loop: "She balanced precisely upon the fragile edge of a half-spoken secret" and "breath catching, lips parted around words trembling on the verge of release" restate the same hesitation without added detail. Template cadence in mid-section: multiple sentences open with subject-verb-object without variation. Apply −0.6 for density + loop; −0.2 for cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose is largely clear. However, several patterns accumulate: "His [noun]" openers ("His calloused fingers," "His humble rebellion," "His students arrived"), recycled "unspoken words" phrasing across beats, and the repeated "amplified quiet" / "fertile quiet" / "reverent silence" cluster. The metaphor "forests of second thoughts" appears twice verbatim. The closure image ("mist lifted, revealing a town unchanged in structure but transformed in spirit") straddles telling and showing. Deductions: template cadence and paraphrase loops total roughly −0.6 in Q7; no causality break, so penalties stay here.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose carries vivid images ("rain-slicked dock," "sand swirled upward in a silent vortex") but suffers from dense figurative language in nearly every sentence of the underwater and island sequences without sufficient variety in rhythm. Template cadence appears in the release sequence: "She unclasped the memory…; she let the weight…" followed by "A soft click…; The scrimshaw pulsed…; Sand swirled…" Stock metaphors ("walls of salt and regret," "spirit lighter," "eyes clear with self-acceptance") and therapy-speak labels ("combative tenderness," "armor of shame") cluster in high-pressure beats, reducing immediacy. Paraphrase loops occur: "the freedom found only in embracing one's true nature" is restated multiple times across paragraphs. These artifacts touch the closure sequence, disallowing 9+ globally and triggering cumulative deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, overwriting patterns accumulate: "morally ambiguous" appears three times as a label; "remade hush" is invoked repeatedly without fresh image work in mid-section; "purposeful," "sustainable," "fragile," and "compassionate" stack modifiers where stronger verbs might carry the load. The phrase "no longer overshadowed but held by the turning sky" mixes metaphors (turbine shadows vs. sky embrace). Figurative density in the final third (alchemy, redistribution, sanctuary, promise, ghost, root) approaches saturation without always adding pressure. These issues touch but do not obscure the closure image, so deduction remains moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "boundaries once thought sacred" appears three times, "tremor of certainty" twice, "lantern-moth hush" three times, "aesthetically driven" twice, with synonym churn around dissolve/soften/clear/bridge. Template cadence runs across multiple beats: "The poet [verb], the [noun] [verb]." Figurative density is high without coherence—"frozen wave," "watercolor on wet paper," "diamond sparks"—and metaphors do not accumulate pressure. Scaffold sentences restate content: lines 5–6 paraphrase each other, as do lines 21–22 and 28–29. Information density is low; most lines perform atmosphere rather than advance situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings shift, avoiding mechanical cadence. Information density is adequate, though some lines do single work: "The world held its breath in the quiet aftermath of the phoenix's ascent, the air still scented with ozone and damp ash" establishes atmosphere but not immediate choice. The final third contains paraphrase loops: "It was a sanctuary where two souls, each carrying imperfection, had woven their fragments into a new, resilient whole" restates the prior exchange without added pressure. "Elara's innocently cunning arrangements had not manipulated, but invited—a gentle key turning in a locked heart" summarizes rather than dramatizes. Template stems appear in the coda: "Elara would return... Kael would shape... Their silent communication would continue..." The artifact density in the final 25% triggers −0.8 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack, and the final-third presence disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("liquid amber," "fertile silence," "stirred ink"), but density suffers from paraphrase loops: "lost sounds are not artifacts to excavate...They are seeds" is restated as "We are gardeners. We prepare silence." The phrase "golden shadows" recurs six times without evolving function, and "powerfully gentle" appears three times as a label rather than an embodied beat. Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("she murmured," "she whispered," "she questioned") reduce propulsion. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull the closure image's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language pervades nearly every paragraph ("silent scream," "fertile ground," "cradle of intentional hope"), creating density that slows momentum and blurs the concrete action underneath. Paraphrase loops appear: "teach withering to bloom" recurs without added pressure; "genuinely artificial" is restated multiple times without evolving cost. Template cadence is visible in the workshop return section, where sequential actions are linked by simple then-chains. The final third carries the heaviest figurative load, which dulls the closure image's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the opening third. However, template cadence emerges in the middle: "She opened...She dipped...She cleaned" and multiple "Elara [verb]" stems cluster without taught pattern. Minor paraphrase loop: the grandmother's methodology is explained twice (Elara's demonstration, then the journal quote). The closure paragraph "After the door closed, Elara cleaned her pen...dipped her nib" recycles prior phrasing without fresh propulsion. Figurative language is mostly clear, though "shimmered like a constellation of collective healing" veers toward stock metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high and most sentences advance the ritual or stakes. Figurative language is frequent ("slow-drifting constellation," "quiet fire," "startled birds") and occasionally coherent, but "atoms of nostalgia" mixing with "petrichor" and "frost on glass" creates mild vehicle drift. Template-cadence issue: multiple sentences open with participial phrases or "She [verb]" across the purification sequence, reducing propulsive variety. Paraphrase loop: "anguished joy" is defined twice (grief vs. joy for truths/wisdom) within two beats. Apply −0.6 for stem repetition and loop, −0.3 for figurative density in peak beats without pattern payoff. No artifact touches the closure image directly, so cap at mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose clarity is generally high, but repetitive scaffold mars momentum: "luminous regret" appears three times, "softly deliberate" twice, "shape of hope" recurs without accumulation. Template cadence in the final third ("Her luminous regret..."; "She finally understood..."; "She would notice...") flattens propulsion. Mixed metaphors: "wave of luminous regret" blends liquid and light without coherent vehicle. Information density is moderate; several sentences paraphrase ("The shadow was not an invader but a gentle catalyst urging..." followed by "It did not consume dreams; it conversed with them"). No grammar errors; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is polished but overwritten in many beats. Figurative language clusters thickly—"silver mist curled possessively," "crushing weight of betrayal transmuted into a clearer alloy," "rose-gold brushstrokes bled eastward"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity and momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: lines 110/126 both describe shedding layers; lines 314/340/357 restate Elara's transformation in near-synonyms. Template cadence dominates the middle third: "First, she shed…" "Next, she shed…" "Then, she shed…" These artifacts dull immediacy and trigger cumulative deductions (−0.8 baseline, escalated to −1.0 for touching multiple beats). Paragraph 223 contradicts 164's "tangible tension released" by claiming transmutation occurs only after all layers are shed.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is coherent ("river deltas and branching nerves," "roots wove a living tunnel"). However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and summary redundancy: lines 221–227, 306, 318, 335, 345, and 356 restate the scars-as-tunnels thesis with synonym churn ("stories are witnessed," "true closure," "scars are tunnels"). The final third recycles the core insight across multiple beats without added pressure, flattening momentum. Template cadence appears in exposition blocks ("She had spent decades…," "She would no longer…"). Deduct −0.6 for loops and scaffold touching the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is dense but mostly legible ("braille of lost time," "silence pooling like water"). Clarity issues: "spatially within the memory" and "emotional architecture" repeat spatial abstraction without concrete grounding; "hushed thunder—a deep, silent detonation" is mixed (thunder implies sound, then negates it). Minor loops: "incubate" appears four times, risking redundancy. The final paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("reverence, courage, gentle closure") that summarize rather than embody.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "trapped creativity" is restated across at least six lines without added detail, and the closing paragraphs cycle through synonyms for the same epiphany ("quiet certainty," "bittersweet peace," "shadowed rapture"). Template cadence runs appear in the middle third ("She traced… floods of remembered stardust surged… vivid flashes"). Stock metaphor strings accumulate without fresh vehicles: "fragile flame," "wellspring of poetry," "river fed by remembered stardust," "tapestry where childhood joy bled into hospital-room sorrow." These artifacts cluster in the final third and dull the closure image. Figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, violating density and coherence checks. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.0 for loops and stock strings, escalated to −1.4 because artifacts touch the closure beat, plus disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual breaks, but template cadence appears in repeated sentence stems: "He [verb]" opens ~dozen lines, and "The [noun]" anchors several descriptive beats. Paraphrase loops occur: lines 76 and 156 both describe the lullaby as "fractured...yet threaded/whole," and lines 88 and 168 both explain the charm's mechanics in near-synonymous terms. Figurative language is dense without always advancing pressure—"the archive's fragile paths," "resonant intent," "wave functions" repeat as conceptual placeholders. Information density is moderate; many sentences do one job (describe, not advance). No proximity errors or grammar breaks, but the accumulated scaffold and loop artifacts prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "He was a conscious cartographer…" / "The journey to rediscover…was not conquest, but collaborative dance" / "To unravel was not destruction, but gentle loosening…" recycling "not X, but Y" structures. Synonym churn in adjacent lines ("translocations brought fear; patience had taught him to trust," then "translocations carrying him to tomorrow's lesson"). Filter verbs stack in peak beats ("he felt the wild frontier…expand," "he understood the probable miracles"). Figurative density clogs momentum: "boundless, organized potential," "blooming clockwork flower," "luminous dance" within three lines. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("the mechanical rainforest watched over him"), triggering disqualification from 9+ and high-band caps. Baseline deduction −1.4 in Q7 for spread and closure contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.1)
    Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence ("sea mist curled like whispered secrets," "leash of sorrow snapped," "unused courage stirred...as a steady, warming ember") without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure (−0.5 overwriting density). Paraphrase loops: "gently persistent" recurs as label across multiple beats without varied embodiment. Stock metaphors ("shoreline lullaby," "seed planted in stillness") cluster in peak beats without fresh specificity (−0.4). Template cadence: "They paused...and lingered...With each deliberate detour..." (−0.4). Cumulative line-level debt disallows 9+ globally and triggers artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, multiple runs of elevated metaphor cluster without clear payoff: "shard of frozen sky," "landscape of mending nerves," "eyes that see beyond dust and hearts heavy with truth," "frostbitten hope." These decorative phrases accumulate in the opening and closing thirds, dulling immediacy. Two paraphrase loops: "safety this fortress provided, a safety that..." and "silence where his laughter should resonate" echoing prior silence themes. Stock metaphor "compass needle pointing toward purpose" in a high-pressure beat. Apply −0.9 for density and coherence issues in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.3)
    Sentence openings vary, but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff ("titan of cosmic lineage housed in a form no larger than a sparrow's egg," "serpent's smile," "seeds planted in time's soil"). Mixed metaphors and elevated diction blur clarity in high-pressure beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "graceful collapse of the lie" is restated as "profound and graceful collapse" within two lines. Template cadence runs ("He felt," "He placed," "He had") stack in the final third, applying −0.6 for line-level artifacts touching closure and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "salt-stiffened joints" = setting, character state, world cost). Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence openings avoid template stems. Two frictions: "periodically eternal" recurs four times, drifting toward stock phrase; the phrase "drifting moored" toggles mechanically between states without evolving its charge. The AI display text ("Analysis: Paths disappeared due to ecological silence") reads expository, undercutting show-through at a peak beat. No loops or scaffold, but figurative density ("threads," "tapestry," "symphony," "stitches") clusters without pattern payoff in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings shift, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats: "profound, aching lull," "thunderous serenity," "sacred geometry" stack elevated diction where leaner prose might sharpen impact. A paraphrase loop appears mid-story: "the hum intensifying into a tangible wave" closely echoes "low, resonant hum… felt deep in the marrow." No fatal clarity breaks, but density occasionally slows momentum. Information packs efficiently in most lines, and the final image propels without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line clarity is high; sentence openings vary and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, template stems recur ("Her plant-telepathy...," "A flash of...," "The glyphs unfolded...") and synonym loops appear ("Her insurgency taught her destiny required action, not passive hope" closely echoes "she, the insurgent grandmother, must unseal it herself"). Stock metaphors ("ghostly plumes," "latent potential") populate descriptive beats. The closure beat is clean, but mid-section density could tighten. No major artifact touches the ending, so non-closure deduction applies: −0.8 for loops and template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "realism's unshakable bedrock" / "realistic weight"; "somatic markers" appears four times in near-identical function; "quietly talented" recycled three times without fresh embodiment. Template cadence dominates the final third: "She [verb]... She [verb]... She [verb]..." across six consecutive beats. Mixed metaphor: "pearl of stillness" as both object and inner glow strains coherence. Information density is moderate; many sentences restate theme rather than advance it. Artifacts touch closure (final paragraph), triggering the Q7 disallow-9+ rule and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies, opening lines anchor voice, information density is generally high. However, patterned artifacts cluster: "luminescent ache" appears four times, "necessary darkness" three times, creating phrase-loop that dulls the closure image. Register drift into abstraction ("redesigning their connection into an elegant spiral," "transformed—the luminescent ache of purpose") in peak beats. Figurative language is dense but occasionally mixed: threads as "liquid starlight" then "ash-gray grief" blurs vehicle coherence. Template cadence in the cellar: "He untangled... He separated... He wove..." runs across multiple lines. Applying artifact penalties (−0.6 baseline, touching closure adds −0.3) and loop/scaffold (−0.4), total reduction ~−1.3, and disallowing 9+ globally per the filter-verb/template-cadence rule.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clear and propulsive, with high information density in key beats (ink spill, drone activation, vanishing). However, "serene anger" appears five times with minor variations, creating a template loop. Figurative language is dense in the opening and closing paragraphs ("patient sculptor," "drink the starlight," "graceful art of letting go"), occasionally verging on purple without always advancing immediacy. Minor paraphrase loop: "transient messages" and "ephemeral patterns" restate the concept. No major causality breaks, and the closure image remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings show range, but figurative density inflates the opening and reflective beats: "cathedral of frozen memory," "the dangerous liaison letter," "contraband truths in its purest, most corrosive form." These stack without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops present: "bravely conflicted, torn between" restates the same tension without adding pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: "Her motivation was not rebellion, but redemption—to provoke…" and "Her method was born of years…" open consecutive moves with parallel exposition. Clarity remains high and no mixed metaphors, but density and scaffold slow momentum before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.9)
    Template-cadence runs in the final third: six consecutive paragraphs open with "She" or "Elara" or "The [noun]," flattening rhythm during the closure approach. Paraphrase loops recur: "weave continuity through chaos" appears identically three times (lines 58, 240, 252); "tranquil blaze" four times without evolving connotation; "engraved quiet" twice. Information density is moderate—many lines do double duty with motif and action—but figurative language crowds most sentences in the final third without pattern-taught payoff, dulling propulsion. Proofreading is clean; no grammar or continuity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify. Information density is high in the garden's sensory catalog and Elara's method. However, multiple lines repeat the "feral lullaby" label (opener, mid-section, twice near the end) without added pressure—paraphrase loop that dulls the closure beat. Template cadence appears in the mid-section: "She leaped… sidestepped… She shaped… exhaling…" Stack of subject-verb stems across four lines triggers minor deduction. Figurative density is high but mostly legible; "rivers of liquid melody" and "thorny thickets of dissonance" work, though some metaphors (indigo mist, silver light) feel stock. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally strong with vivid concrete details (Bakelite receiver, brittle police report, aged Honduran rosewood). However, the piece suffers from noticeable phrase repetition and thematic loops: "devotedly observant" appears three times in similar constructions; "orbits of regret" recurs four times, twice in the same paragraph; "solemn playfulness" is used twice within close proximity. Template cadence emerges in paired constructions: "Contradiction one...Contradiction two," "Next, deduce...Finally, reveal." The final two paragraphs compress revelation and decision into summary rather than scene ("Tomorrow's Chronicle would carry..."), losing momentum precisely where dramatization would elevate impact. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence (not touching closure directly but dulling the penultimate beat).

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often lovely ("needles of pure sorrow," "tapestry of time") but appears in nearly every sentence, creating a uniform lyric texture that flattens propulsion. Several beats loop conceptually: "profound meteor hush descended" and "awe-filled silence" restate the same effect. Template cadence appears in the vision sequence: "She saw… She saw… She saw…" across three lines. The bracketed word counts ([8, [10, etc.) are generation artifacts and ignored per the Text Artifact Screen, but the ornamental density and synonym churn ("hush," "silence," "ceased," "softened") in the final third trigger cumulative deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and opening variety is strong. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, image, or internal shift. However, several lines carry overwriting that blurs immediacy: "parabolic stone walls sheathed in moss that drank the perpetual lilac-tinted mist—the very atmosphere of the unlearning" stacks modifiers and meta-commentary; "the lead of pain into the gold of wisdom" is a stock metaphor. The phrase "the emergent hush began—not as an absence, but as a presence blooming from the mandala's core" uses a template negation structure ("not X, but Y") common in AI-generated prose. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs on the mandala's effect repeat the idea that whispers are honored/woven without advancing new pressure. These artifacts do not touch the closure beat but accumulate to −0.7 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is vivid ("sky shattered into permanent fractures of bruised violet," "ash whispered across cracked cobblestones"), but several phrases loop or rely on elevated abstractions that slow momentum: "gentle radical," "retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy incarnate," "warm coldness of the moment" all function as labels imported from the prompt rather than arising organically from scene pressure. The final two paragraphs contain paraphrase loops—"The renamed ground would teach them" restates the prior claim about mercy and architecture. No major grammar errors, but density dips when thematic summary replaces dramatized image, and stock metaphors ("heart a quiet drum," "spirit a quiet flame") appear without fresh particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative density is high and coherent within the synesthetic frame, but template cadence pervades key beats: "This echo intertwined with… / She drew… / Each echo was a strand…" recycles parallel stems. Paraphrase loops appear: "Her motivation burned with quiet urgency" followed by restating the goal two lines later, and "the fractured timeline responded" is echoed by "the cord… stretched… pulling disparate moments into alignment." Stock phrasing ("profound hush," "relentless march," "liquid light") and elevated register ("coalesced," "translucent palm") dilute immediacy. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance. Artifacts in the closure third (template stems, synonym churn on "echo"/"strand"/"thread") disallow 9+ globally and pull this category below 5.0.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.2)
    The opening paragraph employs vivid sensory anchors (ozone scent, tingling fingertips), but subsequent beats recycle stems and phrasings: "somatic markers" appears six times; "fractally precise" three times without functional variation; "willowglass hope" recurs in identical phrasing. Template cadence emerges in the light painting sequence: "A warmth in her chest pulled her left; a tremor in her wrist signaled an upward sweep... A coolness along her spine directed a slow spiral"—three parallel constructions that flatten rhythm. Paraphrase loops cluster in the closing third: "the willowglass hope they wove was delicate, yet like the finest glass, it could refract..." restates fragility without adding pressure. Filter-verb stacks and synonym churn ("somatic markers," "body's quiet language," "somatic wisdom") dull immediacy at peak beats. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering disallowance of 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or purposeful restraint: "silent language of place," "ember of deep time," "planetary breath," and multiple variations on warmth/light metaphors appear in nearly every paragraph. The grotto beat stacks filter constructions ("a wave of profound peace flooded her," "she perceived," "she felt") that dull immediacy. Paraphrase loops occur: "translate the silent language" / "speak for the silent stones" and "waiting sea" / "patient memory" restate without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in the workshop sequence with repeated "she [verb]" stems across four consecutive sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative density pervades nearly every sentence ("breath of shared hands," "map of mended stone," "dawn's first stitch"), creating a lyric texture that, while coherent, risks overwriting in high-pressure beats (the ceiling crack and final hourglass turn deserve sharper propulsion). Template cadence appears: multiple paragraphs open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" constructions, and synonym loops recur ("quiet" appears six times, "silence" four). Paraphrase loops are present: lines 210 and 226 both assert the prophecy's reinterpretation with minimal added information. Information density is high in the button catalog but sags in closing exposition ("a threshold crossed not by force…").

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with purposeful imagery (engraved pillbox, melting code, forget-me-not). However, template cadence and paraphrase loops appear: "He had mastered being prudently daring—calculating every risk—but caution had become his cage" restates the concept without advancing it; "The pillbox felt different now—not a burden, but a vessel of intention" is a labeled reframe rather than embodied shift. Figurative language clusters in nearly every sentence of key beats ("silver hush," "fragile hinge," "deliberate stitch," "seed of repair"), creating density that occasionally muddles momentum. The final paragraph cycles through closure gestures ("Spring was not a destination, but a direction"; "broken things began, softly, to mend") that feel like synonym variations on a single idea. Information density is moderate; several lines restate emotional state rather than advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual breathing. Information density is generally high, with most lines doing double duty (memory + present anchor). However, several artifacts cluster: synonym loops ("distill…distilled essence," "ambient awareness…closely attentive nature"), elevated register drift ("palimpsest," "spindrift," "percolate") that clashes with coachman POV, and stock metaphor strings ("fog…breathe wisdom," "love's persistent thread"). The phrase "palimpsest promise" recurs without functional shift. Template cadence in reflective beats: "He recalled…He focused…He pressed…" The final third carries multiple thematic summaries that slow momentum rather than charging the image. Apply −0.9 for patterned artifacts (loops, register drift, stock metaphors) and −0.3 for template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Clarity holds through the vision sequence. Overwriting issues: "phototropic devotion," "temporal roots," "fractured timelines coexisted where kindness had been a constant anchor, woven not by magic but by memory" stack figurative/conceptual language in adjacent sentences without breathing room. Paraphrase loop: "Her kindness was not passive; it was a force…" immediately follows prior explanation of the same idea. Template cadence: "He watched…her actions a steady rhythm…each gentle touch…each whispered encouragement…each act a stitch" runs a parallel stem across three beats. Cumulative line-level artifacts lower the score and disallow 9+ globally per the filter-verb and template-cadence caps.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative density is high and often beautiful ("harbor breathed beneath a full moon," "protected vulnerability"), but the accumulation across most sentences borders on overwriting and slows momentum in a piece already light on external action. Paraphrase loops appear ("quivering hush" recurs three times; "wistfully pragmatic" twice as a label). Register drifts into elevated diction ("instilled," "benediction," "perennial seed") that doesn't always match a fire-escape gardener's POV. Template cadence in several beats (repeated "she [verb]" openers) and stock metaphors ("rhythm of oars") dull immediacy, triggering cumulative line-level penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in ritual and memory beats. Minor paraphrase loop: "The isolation she felt was not emptiness; it was the necessary space" restates the independence motivation without adding pressure. Template cadence in opening exposition ("her knuckles white," "her gaze settled," "her motivation was") slightly flattens momentum. Figurative language is dense ("solidified cloud-stone," "salt in water," "starlight-quartz ink") but remains coherent. No filter-verb stacks or major artifacts touching closure. Propulsion is solid through the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is lyrical and imagistic with strong sensory anchors ("droplets clung to every leaf," "damp weight cool in her palm"), but figurative density is high throughout without meaningful variation in pressure beats. Several lines loop conceptually: "secret entrusted to her care" / "keeper of secrets"; "thread that connects all things" / "luminous web" / "converging"; "rejoin" is named three times in closing paragraphs, inflating thematic emphasis. Template cadence appears in the visitor sequence (young man/elderly woman/child, each with parallel structure). The bracketed word counts are generation artifacts and ignored per rubric, but the prose itself exhibits moderate synonym churn ("whispered confessions," "whispered invitation," "whispered memory") and elevated diction that doesn't vary with scene intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high and grammar clean, but the prose suffers from moderate template cadence and paraphrase loops. Multiple sentences open with "Aris" or "He" in identical stems; "cautiously hopeful" appears twice verbatim. Stock metaphors abound: "sleeping giant awakened," "flowers after drought," "dawn bled across the horizon." Figurative density is uneven—high in setup (dust motes dancing, jagged scar of malice) without pattern-teaching or payoff. The final third recycles thematic summary across adjacent lines ("ethereal grit," "precise, compassionate interference," "silent language of subsonic frequencies") without added pressure. Information density is moderate; several scaffold sentences restate prior content. Rhythm is static; no acceleration or breath in step with escalation. Apply baseline artifact penalties for template stems and stock metaphor strings; the closure beat is touched by thematic echo, escalating the deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Sentences generally advance story and atmosphere. However, pervasive overwriting and figurative density blur several peak beats: "reverberation…did not merely echo; it unfolded through the nexus like liquid light, vibrating in her very marrow" stacks metaphors without clarifying the physical effect. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "She traced…She saw…She climbed…She settled…She played." Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs 9–10 restate the claustrophobia/rebellion tension without new pressure. Stock phrasing weakens closure moves: "tears traced clean paths through the dust" and "starlight not as judgment, but as benediction" feel borrowed. Information density is solid overall, but the line-level artifacts touch the climax, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and density is generally high, but several passages loop or restate without added pressure: "silence pressed against Elara's ears" immediately follows "furrowed hush broken only by dripping water"; "She ignored the vast emptiness, focusing on minute disruptions" then lists three near-synonyms (scuff, displaced pebble, thread of intention). The template stem "The [noun] was [state]" recurs four times in the final third ("quarry walls," "quarry was no longer," "weight was not," "steps were lighter"), creating mild cadence monotony. Mixed metaphor: mist "clung...like breath held too long" anthropomorphizes mist, then "furrowed hush" personifies silence without coherent vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, especially in the decoding sequence. However, several lines recycle scaffold phrasing: "Elara felt the weight," "She would return," "The exile was reversed" cluster near the ending in paraphrase loops. "Nervously confident" appears twice without variation, and "overlooked bravery" repeats in the final third. The copper nail's repeated "cold" descriptor (cold promise, cold nail) feels like minor synonym churn. These patterns slightly dull momentum but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from pervasive template artifacts: recycled sentence stems ("the secret mapped by scaffold wrap flutters" appears four times as a fixed phrase), paraphrase loops (lines 68 and 182 restate the motivation nearly verbatim), and thesaurus churn ("luminous disbelief" shifts to "luminous thread"). Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction, flattening propulsion. The final third is heavily laden with thesis-like abstractions that dull momentum. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.0 for spread, −0.7 additional because artifacts touch closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting is pervasive: "dusk bled indigo," "amber light pierced the gloom," "dust motes dancing like forgotten memories," "the valley bathed in forgiving dusk"—figurative language appears in nearly every paragraph without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty (−0.5). Template cadence in expository beats: "His motivation was…," "His defining attribute…," "Each marker was…" creates rhythmic monotony (−0.4). Paraphrase loops: the concept of territorial markers and cycles is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. These artifacts cluster in the setup and dilute momentum, though the final image (currency on the seat, Leo ascending the ridge) is cleaner. Grammar and usage are clean; no typos or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high; grammar and tense are clean. Rhythm varies purposefully (short beats at the telegram arrival, longer cadences during reflection). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "the burden felt utterly solitary" / "began to heal the isolation that had frayed her spirit" / "no longer felt solitary"; "fragments fused into clarity" / "understanding dawns" / "birth of insight"; "shared burden" recurs across five paragraphs without functional variation. Template cadence in the final third ("She wrote not just translation, but testament: how...how...how...") and stacked abstract summaries ("how variable stars teach compassion, how rest is sacred, how community sustains") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure section, triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack. Information density is moderate; many sentences restate thematic content rather than advancing new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clarity and sensory detail are strong; spatial choreography is coherent. Sentence-level propulsion, however, is uneven: many lines stack abstract metaphor without advancing action or knowledge. Opening line "Elara, a druid whose guarded heart was armored in thorns of solitude, stood where the solid world ended and the cursed lake began, her gaze locked on the swirling orchard vortex churning at its heart like a storm of sorrow" loads four metaphoric frames before the first verb of action. Runs of parallel syntax appear: "The first expanding circle was her breath… The second circle was sound… The third circle was memory…" Templates this into a cadence that flattens momentum (−0.5 in Q7 for template-cadence run). Paraphrase loops: "The druid, finally and wholly unbent" echoes "her guarded posture melted, replaced by an open hand" within two paragraphs. Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff that charges closure distinctly (−0.4 for density without escalation). Stock metaphors: "armor forged in betrayal," "storm of sorrow." Grammar and usage are clean; no pronoun ambiguity. Information density is moderate—many lines do one job (describe or state internal shift) rather than layering action with perception. Total deductions and lack of propulsion variance place the score in mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.9)
    Syntax varies and paragraph structure supports rhythm. Information density is generally high in the scar-linking sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "anxious elation" in paragraphs 3, 19, 27; "purposefully curious" in 3, 13, 26; "root-bound" in 2, 22. Template cadence runs through several beats: "She knelt... She traced... She rose..." Near-synonyms churn: "profound peace," "deep, abiding peace" within two paragraphs. Mixed metaphor: scars as "nodes in a living map" then "threads of shared history" then "luminous seam" blurs coherence. Stock constructions ("tears welled," "smiled, a tear tracing dust") and filter-verb reliance ("felt the echo," "felt whole") dull immediacy at closure. Cumulative artifact penalties total roughly −1.4 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is vivid and image-rich, with strong sensory detail ("phosphorescent moss," "bleached femurs," "silver veins bloomed through the char"). Rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice and setting effectively. However, multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "He inlaid meaning everywhere" repeats across lines 7 and 15; "fiercely gentle" recurs in lines 3, 9, and 36; "half-lit" appears in lines 2, 11, and 36. The phrase "bartered destinies" is used four times, and "the hole in his soul" recurs without reweighting. Stock metaphors ("tears tracing clean paths through grime," "silver veins like healing scars") and elevated register ("trammel," "dusky," "covenant") occasionally obscure rather than sharpen. The final third avoids major artifacts, but the accumulated scaffold and synonym churn across the piece lower momentum. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems that dull clarity in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is high, but the prose carries pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "He would abandon… He would become… This cloth would be…" (three parallel stems in succession), and repeated "purpose after loss" across multiple paragraphs. Figurative density in early beats ("ghost of today's failure clinging like a shroud," "bricks in a wall," "tidal wave of shame") stacks without pattern-teaching or payoff. The final third summarizes Leo's transformation in abstract terms ("wrest meaning from loss," "transforming silence into testimony") rather than letting image and action carry the shift. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template runs; −0.5 for stock metaphor density in high-pressure beats; total −1.3 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short urgent beats at despair, longer cadence at planting ritual). Sentence openings vary; no sustained template runs. Information density is high (every line advances character, action, or atmosphere). Minor loop detected: "haunted ambition" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Some phrases approach overwriting ("a silent, graceful unspooling of luminescent energy," "a promise taking root in touching distance") with figurative language clustering in the final third without pattern-teaching. A few filter verbs ("felt the weight," "felt a warmth") dull immediacy slightly. No major artifacts obscure closure, but the density of poetic phrasing in the final paragraphs softens propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied; sentence openings shift. Clarity is high with no causality breaks. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent ("titan-gear," "luminous fragments," "migrating identities"). Two penalties: (1) paraphrase loops across adjacent lines—"Elara smiled, her identity peacefully migrating" restates the established pattern without new pressure (−0.2), and (2) stock metaphor strings in the final third ("seed," "star reignited," "endless sky of memory") feel templated rather than particular (−0.4). Information density is moderate; some lines serve atmosphere more than advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language density is high throughout, with mixed success: "light lived not as invasion but as inherent truth within the stone" works; "vault door within his chest" and "fortress of isolation" are stock metaphors. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 10–11 restate the shell confessions' emotional impact across adjacent beats without added pressure. Template cadence runs: "The action of crowning complete, the cave's latent radiance erupted" → "The resonant hush deepened into" → "Elias felt a vault door" chains declarative summary stems. Sentence openings vary, but information density suffers when lyric phrasing prioritizes texture over propulsion. Artifacts touch the closure sequence (paragraphs 16–18), applying the elevated penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies effectively and information density is high in spatial beats. Overwriting clusters appear in reflective passages: "every leaf trembled with meaning, every shadow held memory" front-loads metaphor without pattern-teaching payoff. Paraphrase loop detected: "self-forgiveness was not a destination" is restated across multiple lines in the bathroom scene. Template cadence in final third: "She would return... she had documented... The ivy would keep growing... she would move forward" creates mechanical parallelism. Filter-verb stack in emotional beats ("faced," "drawn to," "settled on," "cradled") slightly dulls immediacy. These artifacts cluster near closure, preventing 9+ eligibility. Clarity remains intact; propulsion sags under figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.3)
    Information density is low; adjacent sentences restate without added pressure: "She had come seeking the library, but the true motivation had always been deeper—to confront the silence within herself" is a paraphrase loop (−0.2). Template cadence runs appear: "The first letter… The second letter…" and "She documented it all, understanding the library processed…" echoes scaffold phrasing. Figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching: "veiled dreamer," "crystalline spires," "latent syllables," "symphony of human experience," "melody of regret and hope"—register drift into abstract elevation that clashes with the urgency of peak beats (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("bridge she was building," "silence answered with understanding") reduce specificity. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.0 in Q7, plus the elevated diction in peak beats disallows 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("velvet observatory swallowed," "stone in her chest," "tightening coil," "beautiful, necessary loss") without always advancing pressure; several metaphors feel decorative rather than propulsive. Paraphrase loop present: "perforated destiny" appears four times with slight rephrasing but no added meaning after the first two uses. Template cadence in the coffee-reading passage: "One stain showed... Another revealed..." constructs parallel clauses that read mechanical. Information density is uneven: the mulberry's backstory ("mended her loneliness") is told rather than enacted. Clarity remains high and no artifacts touch the closure beat (violin dissolves, shoot unfurls), so deductions are capped at non-closure levels. Sentence rhythm does not vary purposefully under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language clusters densely without pattern-teaching: "sky congealed," "silence so profound it seemed to glow," "minutes stretched like spun glass," "mandala snapped," all within a brief span. Template cadence appears in repeated "She [verb]" stems across the middle third. Paraphrase loops: "radiant hush" recurs as "luminous silence" and "sacred anticipation" without added pressure. Stock metaphors (rivers, galaxies, snowflakes in perception) and overwriting in high-pressure beats (the threshold moment) dull immediacy and lower information density. Apply −1.2 cumulative for density, loops, and template patterns per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "forgotten dreams," "quiet ember," "tangled threads," "majestic dance," "liquid metronome," "captured tear of joy" appear in quick succession without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea (e.g., paragraphs 2–3 both establish grotto atmosphere). Template cadence appears in the final third ("each precise tap… each new scallop… each one a unique story"). The cumulative effect blunts momentum and clarity at key ritual beats, triggering artifact penalties. Information density is moderate; many lines perform thematic work but advance situation slowly.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally controlled with varied syntax and purposeful compression, but several patterns accumulate: "sincerely insincere reassurance," "protected vulnerability," and "cloak of doubt" are labeled and re-labeled rather than fully dramatized. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("The cloak... It is armor that became a cage" echoes earlier framing). The phrase "conscience for hire by solemn vocation" and "quintessentially a breezy lighthouse at dawn" edge toward elevated diction that slightly distances from immediate scene pressure. Figurative language (fractured light, departing shadow, tiny star) is vivid but clusters densely in reflective beats. No major clarity breaks, but cumulative drift from high immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but overwriting and density issues pervade. Figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching: "temporal layer," "currents," "translation," "convergences and divergences," "silent language of patterns" appear in most high-pressure sentences. Mixed metaphor: "time unwinding in his marrow" followed by "biology unfolded backward" uses incompatible vehicles. Template cadence: "He would withhold... ensuring students first mastered... before navigating" and "The lesson woven... was complete: to teach vanishing... one must first withhold... and cultivate patience" repeat stem structures. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 14–16 restate the vanishing/appearing thesis three times. Apply −1.2 cumulative (density −0.5, mixed metaphor −0.4, template cadence −0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm is ceremonial and sustained, but density suffers: multiple adjacent sentences restate the same idea in elevated synonyms (e.g., paragraph two's "monolithic spines, colossal skulls, rib cages vast as cathedrals" and "hollow chambers amplifying each breath into a chorus of memory" both describe the towers' acoustic scale without advancing situation). Paraphrase loops appear in the opening (wind/dust/prayers; bone/libraries/pages) and at closure ("did not rise… did not need to" followed by "weathered resolve had become the canyon's new harmonic anchor"). Figurative language is dense throughout without pattern-teaching, and some metaphors blur (dust as "forgotten prayers," "living river of shadow and light"). Template cadence: several sentences open with "The [noun]" or "[Possessive] [trait/motivation]" in succession. Stock phrases like "quiet urgency" and "breath stilled" appear. Line-level clarity is generally intact, but momentum drags under decorative layering. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops, −0.4 for template cadence, −0.3 for figurative density without payoff = baseline deduction ~−1.3 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lyric and imagistic with high figurative density ("needle of frozen time," "suspended diamonds," "chimed like crystal bells"). Sentence openings vary, and rhythm modulates with scene pressure (short beats at the keystone, longer contemplative lines descending). Two frictions lower the score: (1) paraphrase loops appear in adjacent beats ("brilliant dimness: a luminous haze neither dark nor bright" restates the same concept; "kneeling, she placed her palms… Kneeling, she…" recycles the posture without added pressure), and (2) figurative stacking in peak beats occasionally muddles clarity ("a deeper, richer dimness that illuminated the soul" mixes metaphor vehicles—dimness illuminating—without grounding the image in concrete sensation). Information density is high, and momentum holds, but the accumulation of lyric ornament risks overwriting in a story already operating in heightened register.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple prose artifacts cluster in the second half: paraphrase loops ("understood: the color of sound was love's emotional resonance—the sound of Elara's voice was dawn's gold"), template cadence in the middle third (repeated "he [verb]" structures), and filter-verb stacks ("he swore," "he knew," "he understood") that dull immediacy during the climactic logbook discovery. Stock metaphors ("sleeping sentinels," "celestial dust") and synonym churn around "light" (honeyed light, chromatic signature, luminous vows, glow, radiance) reduce clarity. The final three paragraphs recycle "light" and "promise" without advancing pressure. Deductions: paraphrase loop −0.4, template cadence −0.5, filter stacks −0.5, artifacts in closure zone push penalty toward −1.4 total, capping high-band entry and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.7)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "to wavelength align," "to find the precise harmonic resonance," "to distill meaning" cycle across adjacent lines. Runs of "She [verb]" stems appear in the middle third. The final third reprises "wavelength," "stellar doubt," "distill," and "backwards prophecy" without added pressure. Figurative language (amber as museum, universe as pearl, static as chaos-echo) is present in most sentences without payoff at closure. Baseline −1.0 for loops and template cadence; −0.4 additional for density without escalation in peak beats. Information density is moderate but momentum stalls from synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines advancing story and atmosphere. Several figurative phrases are effective ("slow bleed of dusk," "particles a tiny chronicle"), but the piece leans toward elevated diction throughout high-pressure beats without clear pattern-teaching ("vibration," "formless echoes," "sacred transformation," "alchemy"). Paraphrase loops appear: "echo of sacrifice was not memory alone; it was a vibration" restates the same abstraction. Template cadence in the middle crystallization sequence: "He turned… Another echo… He poured… it crystallized" repeats structure across three beats. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") are present but not stacked. The closing lines ("He was a namer of shadows, a weaver of light from loss") read as thematic summary rather than image-driven propulsion. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and figurative density in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity and rhythm are generally strong, with vivid images ("liquid gemstones," "brittle as spun glass") and purposeful sentence variation in peak beats. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear frequently: "earnestly naive" recurs across multiple paragraphs with slight rewording ("earnest naivety was her armor," "quiet certainty," "unwavering attention"), and the concept of "brittle devotion" is restated in adjacent lines ("sharp, fragile commitment," "brittle as spun glass yet unbroken"). Template cadence in the final third: multiple sentences begin with "She" or "Elara" in succession, and several late paragraphs restate the same point—healing requires repetition, faith, drops not spells—without added pressure. Filter-verb reliance ("she felt," "she knew," "she recalled") occasionally dulls immediacy. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template stems, plus minor figurative muddle ("cosmic imbalance" and "reality's weave" mix metaphors without grounding).

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and sentences often do double duty (e.g., "skeletal remains of Oakhaven—a town deliberately flooded sixty years prior"). Rhythm varies appropriately and no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. However, several lines in the final third lean into abstraction and summary ("proving the past was not a ghost to fear but a foundation to honor," "all held within the mirrored hush of the resurfacing world") that dull immediacy. Figurative language occasionally stacks without clear payoff ("poignant perfume of return," "sacred space waiting for truth"). Apply −0.6 in Q7 for density and register drift in closure vicinity.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is grammatically clean with vivid imagery and no orientation or continuity breaks. However, overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the transformation sequence carries figurative language ("liquid prism," "breathing entity," "silent fluid scripture," "mountain mist," "river of light") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density without propulsion. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "harmonize logic's sharp edges with intuition's quiet hum" echoes across "logic provided the vessel and intuition... provided the soul" and "rigid walls between reason and feeling dissolved." Template cadence runs through the starlings passage ("Logic cataloged... intuition felt... This was the method..."). Stock metaphors ("fractured light," "woven copper," "golden radiance") cluster without transformation. These artifacts reduce information density and dull momentum, especially in the climactic beats. Apply −0.8 for density + coherence issues, and an additional −0.4 for paraphrase loops, totaling −1.2 within Q7's non-closure cap.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong imagery (silverwood vines, obsidian floor, star-dusted velvet sky). However, the piece exhibits paraphrase loops and synonym churn around "trust" and "burden" across multiple beats (preserved/restored/deepened, watcher's burden mentioned three times with minimal variation). Template cadence appears in the closing sequence: "She adjusted... The stars held... Elara stood... Above the world..." cycles through similar declarative stems. The "Cumulative: X" annotations are scaffolding artifacts but do not obscure causality. Information density is moderate; some lines in the final third restate emotional closure without advancing it.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.8)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "defeat numbness" / "shattering numbness" / "numbness was gone"; "custody battle dissolved" / "custody battle was forgotten"; "complementary opposites" recurs five times without evolving function. Template cadence runs through the final third ("History would keep rewriting… but on the floating rock"; "She had arrived… and found instead"; "In granting freedom, Kaela had reclaimed"). The closure paragraph stacks abstractions ("release and remembrance, silence and song," "compassionate integration," "authentic vivification") that dull the final image. Baseline −1.0 for loops and scaffold, escalated to −1.4 because artifacts touch closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often stacked: "leaf blower symphony conductor," "macerate the silence," "excavation, not performance," "canvas," "ghost of joy" appear within a narrow span. Several adjacent sentences restate content ("The new quiet felt lighter, acknowledged" followed by "the house had exhaled"). Template stems recur: "He [verb]" opens multiple beats. Clarity remains intact, but momentum drags under the metaphor load, and paraphrase loops reduce propulsion in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence-level imagery is vivid and purposeful ("mist curled like smoke from a dying candle," "a sob catch in its throat sharp as tearing vellum"), and rhythm varies naturally. Information density is high in the opening third. However, the piece exhibits paraphrase loops in the final quarter: "The ache of dimensional homesickness remained but had transformed" is immediately restated as "no longer a key to escape but a token of commitment," and the closing three paragraphs recycle the core insight with synonym churn ("tending the delicate, sacred space," "willing, compassionate companion to the unknown," "exactly where it was meant to be"). Apply −0.6 for template cadence and redundancy touching the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is lyric and image-dense, with strong sensory specificity (frost on lashes, spider-silk cloth, liquid moonlight). However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density penalties: "violet into indigo," "fertile void," "captured starlight," "living staff," "cradle of beginnings" stack without rhythmic relief. Paraphrase loops appear ("frozen bloom" recurs five times; "stifling destiny" twice in close proximity). Template cadence in the final third—"She had interrupted…," "She was no longer…," "In the staff's steady glow…"—flattens propulsion. Filter-verb reliance ("perceived," "felt," "saw") dilutes immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong moments of sensory texture ("wind-scoured platform," "star-dusted void"). Information density is solid in the opening third. However, the middle and closing sections lean into paraphrase loops and summary: "Each discarded assumption vanished like dust" is followed by "The receiver's hiss softened, deepened…" without dramatizing the transition. Template cadence appears in several adjacent lines ("She had not decoded… She had realized… Her quest was fulfilled…"). The final paragraphs summarize rather than propel, and figurative language ("cathedral of resonance") feels elevated without fresh specificity. These artifacts cluster near closure, triggering accumulation and placement penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.5)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the grotto sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "resiliently positive spirit" recurs three times with synonym drift ("not diminished but forged"), and the closure paragraph restates theme mechanically ("permanent transient," "bridge between worlds," "guardian of thresholds"). Figurative language is dense but occasionally strained: "motivation crystallized with starlit clarity" mixes registers, and "patterns fused into a single, brilliant mandala" is stock mystical imagery. Template cadence in the grotto: "He studied... He would broadcast... He poured..." No major line-level opacity, but cumulative minor artifacts and -0.4 for paraphrase loops in the final third lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are generally distinct. Information density is moderate, with some scaffolding in phrases like "her singular motivation had consumed her for years" that summarize rather than advance. The eruption beat achieves propulsion, but adjacent lines paraphrase: "These were not illusions; they were authentic fragments" followed by "The rational enchantment shattered, and the boundary...dissolved" restates the same collapse. Figurative language in the climax—"forests of forgotten promises," "river of flowing time"—coheres tonally but clusters densely without pattern-teaching. No major loops or template cadence, but mild synonym churn in the final third ("gathering the threads," "weave again," "woven into the greater whole").

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "somber marvel" recurs four times, "balancedly curious" three times, "unfolded horizons" five times, creating synonym churn that restates the same conceptual claim without advancing pressure. The final third compounds this with stacked abstractions: "expanding the soul's capacity," "height of their aspirations," "silent, steady rhythm of unfolded horizons." Runs of identical sentence stems—"Kael knew," "Kael felt," "Kael understood"—appear across six beats without variation. These artifacts cluster in the closure section, triggering the escalated Q7 penalty (−1.7 baseline) and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap. Figurative language is clear but dense in non-peak beats without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, patterned artifacts cluster in high-pressure beats: "a pulse so faint it felt like memory itself," "thin as spider silk yet threaded with urgent tenderness," "fragile echoes…fragile smile…fragile exchange" (synonym loops on "fragile"). Template cadence appears in the final third: "She had sought…she had inadvertently…she had assured…she had fortified." The closure beat suffers from stacked summary clauses ("watching Lily's shoulders straighten…Elara felt the quiet triumph") that dull immediacy. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: baseline −0.6 for loops and stems in the final third, plus −0.3 for figurative density without payoff in peak beats (−0.9 total).

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is high—most lines advance setting, pressure, or character state. Opening establishes voice and stakes; final image recharges the crashing hush motif with accrued meaning. Minor template cadence in the descent sequence: "He followed... boots splashing... the serpent... he focused" cycles through similar stems. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "concrete throat," "serpent of claustrophobia," and "drumbeat of closure" work through embodied pressure. "Crashing hush" as oxymoron is deployed frequently (six times) without always earning fresh meaning, trending toward stock repetition by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "ghost of her own erased life" / "digital ghost of her deleted records"; "fragmented echo" / "scattered data shards." Template cadence in lines 10–12 ("Her action tonight was to defragment… Her method relied on…") and 13–15 ("She poured… Guiding… she carved") flattens momentum. "Tears traced paths down her cheeks, freezing at her jawline—release given physical form" is stock embodiment. Figurative density (neural map, constellations, blueprint, compass) stacks without payoff. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems; −0.3 for register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the piece carries pervasive figurative layering that slows momentum in non-closure beats: "canyon of endless echoes," "skeletal cathedrals," "transient glyphs," "woven thread," "captured constellation of meaning." In the final third, template cadence appears—"The towers stood…," "Her work was done…," "The language was not dead; it was reborn…"—and several lines paraphrase prior content without added pressure (e.g., "She knew the timeframe was complete" restates what the prior paragraph already enacted). Stock metaphors ("weight of centuries," "breath of a dying language") accumulate without fresh grounding. Paraphrase loops and elevated diction in closure beats trigger the patterned-artifact penalty; capping at 8.8 globally per Q7 artifact rules and disallowing 9+ across all categories.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is mostly clear and propulsive, with strong imagery ("flint arrowhead rested like a sleeping serpent"). However, several phrases loop or paraphrase: "The static was not noise; it was a language" echoes "These are not random sounds," and "bitterness" recurs without fresh embodiment. Figurative density is high in the metamorphosis beat ("light weaving through her skin like morning mist through branches") without muddle, but the cluster of stock metaphors ("cathedral of roots," "cosmic joke") and some filter-verb stacks ("felt," "realized") dull immediacy. Template cadence is minimal. Net: functional with mild overwriting that doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and sentence openings shift, but figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "policed by," "leaching color," "thump-thump," "bridge spun from shared vibration," "hard-won grace." Mixed metaphor appears ("bridge spun from shared vibration between solitude and spirit")—vibration doesn't spin a bridge. Template cadence in the climax: "Cherry blossoms burst... apple trees groaned... jasmine scent thickened... Birds... took flight... Fireflies sparked"—a list-like catalog that flattens propulsion. The cumulative word counts are scaffolding artifacts but do not obscure causality. Minor paraphrase loop: "tarnished wonder" (line 2) recurs as "tarnished wonder was polished anew" (line 28), though the reprise is intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and free of typos, but suffers from pervasive decorative density: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats (the bottle uncorking, the drone launch) carries stacked metaphor or poetic phrasing ("violet lightning flashed, mist fell, energy crackled," "tiny beacon vanishing," "fragile electricity of possibility"). Template cadence appears in repeated sentence stems: "For Elara… For old Manis…" and "He honored… He fostered… He maintained…" across adjacent paragraphs. Paraphrase loops are present: "brittle hush" recurs three times; "respectfully rebellious" is used twice in close proximity without added meaning. Information density is moderate—many lines do atmospheric work but advance story minimally. The figurative language in the climax (violet lightning, liquid sapphire, thunderstorm settling) obscures the physical sequence: does the mist actually blind the drone's sensors, or is the effect symbolic?

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is textured and rhythmically varied, with vivid images ("ivy cradling," "sunlight fracturing into a whispering gleam"). Information density is high in the discovery sequence. However, pervasive figurative density in nearly every sentence ("pearlescent veil," "walnut flanks," "reverent dance," "compass," "cradle of renewal," "symphony," "fertile ground") overloads the register without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.5 for density without escalation. Template cadence in the final third: "She would return… She started… Driving away…" uses repeated sentence stems without variation. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs describing "misting hush" and "quietly persistent" echo conceptually. Stock metaphor: "warm shroud" for peace. Figurative coherence mostly holds, but "shroud" (death) for peace introduces mild contradiction. Accumulation: −0.7 in Q7 for density + template + loop, with artifacts in the final third disallowing 9+ globally per the Text Artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several beats show template cadence and paraphrase loops. Lines 61 and 70 restate Elara's motivation with synonym churn ("locate the tangible place" vs. "soul of narrative resided in the felt"); lines 181 and 189 loop the hyperbolic-diagram insight. The phrase "tattered silk scarf" recurs seven times, often in identical construction, creating textural monotony. The metaphor "vibrant presence" (line 229) and "living atlas of connection" (line 251) are stock formulations that reduce specificity. Minor register drift: "sanely eccentric" and "rational poetry of order" read as elevated abstractions slightly outside a naturalistic interior voice. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats. Applying −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor strings, totaling −1.1 before band adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong visual specificity. However, several patterns reduce density: paraphrase loops ("the dream was vitalized" echoed by "vitalized, whole, and finally at home"), synonym churn around "luminous absence" (appears four times with minor variation), and template stems ("She closed her eyes...she held the filter...she pressed the shutter"). The final third stacks tell-phrases: "not as a ghost of the past, but as a living truth," "a quiet understanding settling deep in her bones," "no longer lost...waited within her all along." Figurative language in the closure beat ("testament to patience and hope," "palette for peace") edges toward stock metaphor. Information density is high in the turret sequence but thins in the descent and library return. No major grammatical errors; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase/template artifacts touching closure, −0.3 for stock metaphor in final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence ("canopy of ancient oaks whispering," "horizon bled from amber," "shadows coiled…like smoke," "filament of captured starlight") without pattern-teaching or payoff, diluting clarity and slowing momentum. Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "enveloped secrets" appears three times, "quiet" five times, "improbable longing" twice; adjacent lines restate concepts (e.g., "the seal formed from enveloped secrets" followed immediately by a list of those secrets). Template cadence runs through the middle third: "He moved…He awaited…He held…He spoke…He pressed." Stock metaphors ("world grown weary of shadows," "seed of grace") and elevated diction ("nexus," "latent energy," "cosmic possibility") clash with the demand for concrete propulsion. Information density is low; many sentences do decorative work without advancing situation or choice. Combined artifact load and pervasive figurative muddle trigger −1.4 in Q7, and the template cadence run in the climax disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is concrete. However, repeated phrase stems ("chronic curiosity" appears three times with similar framing; "the crisp nostalgia," "the fairy ring," and "the shipwrecks" recur in near-identical syntactic slots) create mild template cadence. The mid-story shift from vivid perception ("splinter of glass," "wind-whispers through shipwreck ribs") to late summary ("decades later, the sunken orchard no longer haunted him; it healed him") introduces a minor momentum dip. Figurative density is high but controlled; no mixed metaphors. The bracketed word counts are generation scaffolding and ignored per the artifact screen, but the prose itself carries low-grade paraphrase loops ("memories returned… as clarity" followed immediately by summary of what that clarity contains). Apply −0.6 for template stems and mild loops, keeping the piece out of the 7.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor stakes and image cleanly. Information density is high in the tea-leaf beats: each observation advances both method and meaning. However, template cadence appears in the middle third: "This sharp angle? A decision…" / "This flowing curve? A memory…" / "This cluster…" runs three parallel rhetorical questions without variation, triggering −0.4. Synonym churn is present: "observe," "look deeper," "stared intently" cycle through near-duplicates of visual scrutiny across adjacent beats. No major loops obscure causality, but the tea-leaf explication leans toward over-explanation rather than trusting Elara's (and the reader's) discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically consistent but over-relies on abstract high-register diction ("tangible acceptance of the captured essence," "harmonize, fused for a breathless moment by love and purpose"). Repeated sentence stems flatten momentum: "She saw," "She felt," "She wove," "She would plant." The cumulative word-count markers are generation scaffolding and ignored per rubric, but figurative language ("living loom," "needle pulling light into pattern") appears in most lines of the visualization beat without varied texture, applying moderate density penalty. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks, but information density is diluted by synonym elaboration ("not of sorrow, but of profound connection").

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.9)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence carries figurative load ("coiled like smoke," "settling frost," "wave of pure peace") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty (−0.5). Mixed metaphors appear ("silence...accumulate...thickening like settling frost" conflates liquid and solid states). Register occasionally drifts into workshop abstraction ("lucid unrest," "interlaced hush") that clashes with the hands-on POV. Template cadence in the knot-sequence beats ("A knot of terror released...A knot of longing revealed") adds −0.4. Paraphrase loops in the final paragraph ("no longer merely a restorer...but a weaver") restate the same realization. Total artifact deduction: −1.3, and since artifacts touch the closure beat, 9+ is disallowed globally and high-band entries capped at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with many sentences doing double duty (description + world-building). However, overwriting appears in multiple high-pressure beats: "a silence that felt less like absence and more like invitation," "the language of dripping water and shifting light," and stacked metaphors ("watercolor memories," "sentence in a language of erosion") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Register drift into elevated diction ("profound kinship," "calibrated observatory where earth and sky conversed") clashes with the POV's scholarly but grounded lexicon. Apply −0.6 for density and register drift in peak beats, preventing entry into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with strong imagery ("ghostly anemones," "surgeon's patience," "stone in his chest"). Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports momentum. Three issues compound: (1) Paraphrase loop at lines 232–239 restates the settling metaphor across three adjacent beats without added pressure (−0.4). (2) Figurative density in the closure sequence—"microcosm of turmoil," "turbulence to dissipate energy under acceptance's gentle pull," "transformed the miniature world"—stacks metaphors that blur rather than sharpen (−0.3). (3) Template cadence at lines 94–105: "His method would be," "He would liberate," "His gloved fingers brushed" (−0.2). The artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence openings vary and figurative language is dense ("mist swirled around her wrists like a supportive spirit," "ghost in code," "silent symphony"). However, overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the carving sequence deploys metaphor or elevated abstraction ("alchemy of sorrow into symbol," "spectral presence woven from collective longing"), flattening momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "giving form to the formless, voice to the voiceless" restates the premise without adding pressure, and "ghost in code" recurs as a label rather than evolving meaning. The phrase "tinkersong wonder" appears three times, two as identical formula. Template cadence runs: "A spiral for…, a fractured line for…, a cluster of stars for…" across multiple beats. Filter verbs ("seemed to hum," "would pause," "would find") cluster in the final third, dulling immediacy. The closure beat ("subtly transformed, humming with the echo of needs finally spoken") abstracts the effect rather than anchoring it in concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with varied rhythm and strong sensory detail ("brass frames scarred by high-altitude winds," "frost-bleached diary"). Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or theme. However, paraphrase loops appear: lines 190 and 214 both restate the joy-within-anguish thesis, and the final paragraph (lines 325–369) recycles the same thematic claim across multiple sentences ("joy hidden beneath every shadow of sorrow," "quiet, unfolding grace"). Template cadence appears in the elevator-chime transitions ("Floor 5 chimed," "Floor 7 chimed"), which mechanically mark beats without variation. The closure beat itself is clean, limiting the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "empty spaces remember" / "empty spaces did not forget"; "quietly explosive" appears identically three times; "dusty starlight" recurs four times without reweighting. Template cadence in the catalogue middle ("A fractured altocumulus... A high cirrus... A lenticular cloud...") flattens rhythm. Stock metaphors ("contained lightning," "dark tear"). These artifacts spread across the piece but do not obscure the closure image itself. Deductions: −0.6 for loops, −0.4 for template cadence, −0.3 for stock strings = baseline ~6.4 after accumulation cap.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is generally high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or the central question. Weaknesses: minor paraphrase loops ("infinity resides not in scale, but in meticulous detail" followed closely by "limits are not prisons, but essential vessels"); occasional stacked modifiers in descriptive passages ("faint, ominous heartbeat," "quiet, precise compass"); and a few abstract declaratives that could be more concrete ("a revelation bloomed," "her understanding of creation itself"). No major scaffold or template cadence, but the overwriting in the reflection-heavy middle slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is dense in the coin-discovery beat but largely coherent; one mixed vehicle: "spiral galaxy within a nautilus shell within a fern frond" stacks three incompatible scales without clear unifying logic.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and most sentences advance action or description. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "stranded luminance" is re-explained across paragraphs; "diligently curious" is restated as "Her diligently curious mind"; the final paragraph summarizes theme already shown. Template cadence is mild ("She would note… she sketched… she found…"). Figurative language ("living tapestry," "captive ember," "warm embrace") is workmanlike but not dense enough to obscure; the main issue is redundancy that softens momentum into the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language pervades most sentences ("frost-veined," "breath a fragile ghost," "driftwood nostalgia," "symphony of light," "liquid silver," "silent symphony," "warm, enduring ember") without pattern-teaching or escalation, triggering density penalties of −0.6. Paraphrase loops appear: "hall of mirrors swallowed her whole" then "infinite Elaras reflected in frozen silver"; "hauntingly bright" recurs as label without embodied cost; "rhythm of repair" and "cadence" are restated across paragraphs. Template stems ("She laid," "She chose," "She recapped") cluster in the climax. The final paragraph summarizes theme ("the rhythm was not in the fixing, but in the honoring") rather than trusting the image. Information density is moderate; key beats (uncapping, gear selection, installation) advance clearly, but scaffold phrasing ("with deliberate care," "with reverence") pads transitions. No loops touch the closure sentence directly, capping non-closure penalties at −0.8 under the accumulation rule.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid uniformity. Information density is high (star charts, harmonic key, Respite Nebula mechanics compressed efficiently). Minor loops: "brambled hope" appears in paragraph 5 and recurs verbatim in the final line; "shared effort" and "collective effort" echo across beats. Template cadence in the climax: "Kael...adjusted...A beam...struck...A silent chime vibrated...Where the light touched..." uses parallel "[Subject] [verb]" stems across four sentences. "Threads of patience," "tapestry stitched with threads" risks metaphor redundancy. Line-level clarity remains strong; these issues lower from mid-7s to upper-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes. However, several beats exhibit paraphrase loops: lines 86–96 and 138–146 restate the pane's effect (sound swallowed, absolute stillness, heartbeat ceased) without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the "she [verb]" and "the [noun] [verb]" patterns across 15+ lines. Figurative density is high (weeping stones, fractal geometries, bruised awe, tenderized sorrow) without a taught pattern or clear payoff at closure, and mixed metaphors appear ("nested patterns dissolved into starlight" juxtaposes geometric and optical vehicles). Stock metaphors: "clean paths through dust," "intertwining like old friends." Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems, −0.4 for figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies well and information density is high (e.g., "a brittle vellum scrap found beneath a loose floorboard in the caretaker's cottage, its ink faded but its purpose clear" packs discovery, state, and function). Clarity and concision are strong in the assembly sequence. Two friction points: the phrase "Total: [number]" appears after every paragraph as generation artifact scaffold—treat as non-textual per the rubric, no penalty. A minor paraphrase loop: "offhandedly exact precision" (para 10) and "graceless yet unnervingly precise" (para 11) restate the same concept across adjacent beats without added pressure, triggering −0.2 under the loop check.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports the reflective mode. Information density is generally high, but paraphrase loops and thematic restatements accumulate: "The chrysalis echoed that hollow feeling" immediately after "hollow success and a chasm"; "divergence was not failure, but a necessary phase" is restated multiple times across the second half. Template cadence runs appear in the final third ("He would begin the letter…" / "He carried the ravine's lesson…" / "He turned toward the road…"). Figurative language (polymer metaphors, symphonic imagery) is dense and occasionally stacked without pause, reducing propulsion in high-pressure beats. Clarity remains intact, but momentum is dulled by synonym churn and scaffold phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is dense with figurative language and elevated diction that accumulates without pattern-teaching or clear payoff in many beats ("fragile covenant," "singularity of beginning," "coordinate where potential concentrated"). Mixed metaphors appear: "glimmering parole" is described as both a "shimmering promise" and a "covenant" that is "contingent" and "visible only when acknowledged," creating conceptual blur. Paraphrase loops recur: the opening's "cool, absolute void" and "emptiness feel vibrant and expectant" restate the same idea across multiple sentences. Template cadence is evident in the meditation sequence ("the stone's chill suggested mountain streams; its smoothness, water-worn journeys; faint striations hinted at ghost-maps"), which cycles through parallel constructions without advancing pressure. The penultimate paragraph over-explains the thematic realization ("She understood: the place where stories begin was not…") in a manner that flattens the closure image. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: figurative density without clear payoff −0.5, mixed metaphors −0.4, paraphrase loops −0.3, template cadence −0.3, thematic over-explanation in closure beat −0.5, totaling approximately −2.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "spilled ink," "desert glass," "sun-baked clay." However, the subsuming beat stacks metaphors without clear physical grounding—"adding imagined warmth of forgiveness, sweetness of time, umami of hard-won wisdom"—blurring the line between concrete action and abstract summary. Paraphrase loops appear: "raw grief" / "raw pain," "stored remorse" recurs five times across adjacent paragraphs. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm supports the lyric mode, but peak-beat clarity suffers from metaphor density.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence in the opening and climax carries figurative language without pattern-teaching or clear payoff (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear ("construct bridges from silos, weaving isolated threads"; "bridges she constructed were invisible yet stronger than steel, forged from empathy"). Template cadence runs through the grain elevator response sequence ("responded in warm Italian," "chimed in Portuguese," "rumbled from the north"). Stock metaphors ("night-blooming flower," "hand across a void") and therapy-speak ("emotional and acoustic resonance," "shared vulnerability") dull clarity in peak moments (−0.5). Combined artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "This was the essence of her new vocation… to become a vessel" restates the earlier transformation claim. Template stems recur: "She felt the weight… the metallic taste… the fragile hope." Figurative density ("spectral light," "emotional fossils," "torrent," "crucible") clusters without payoff. Stock metaphors ("ore in a crucible," "double helix of shared humanity") appear in peak beats. Scaffold phrases ("This object," "This arrangement," "This period") mark paragraph openings. The closure beat ("she had finally found her true design") is a thesis statement rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and spatially coherent, but carries pervasive overwriting: stacked modifiers ("salt-laced mist clinging... like a spectral shroud"), synonym loops ("latent blaze" / "quiet fire" / "warming her"), and stock metaphors ("liquid stars," "cooling embers"). Figurative density in high-pressure beats (threshold crossing, combination reveal) blurs immediacy rather than sharpening it. Template cadence appears in reflective passages: "This described... This revelation... These were the seeds..." Several beats paraphrase prior content without adding pressure. Information density is moderate; many lines do double work, but scaffolding phrases ("she understood," "she recalled") dull propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose is largely clean with vivid concrete images ("dewdrop a suspended note," "hairline crack near the base"). However, multiple lines loop conceptually: "The silence was not broken; it was deepened, enriched" after "not to shatter the quiet, but to converse with it"; "empathy in motion" appears twice within a paragraph; and "intensely quiet" recurs without added pressure. The phrase "after the hedgehog uncurled" is repeated three times as a frame device, which reads more like scaffold than pattern. Filter verbs ("seemed to lean," "felt the wood's silent testimony") cluster in reflective beats, dulling immediacy. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks, but density is lowered by paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally clear with strong imagery ("sky bleeding twilight hues," "dent worn by thirty years"). However, several passages loop conceptually: "correlate" appears five times in adjacent paragraphs, and the worry stone dent is described three times with near-identical phrasing ("cool and smooth except for one deep dent," "the dent in the stone," "the dent now a signature"). Template cadence is evident in the final third: "He carried... He was no longer... The magnetic hum... He walked..." These artifacts dull momentum and appear in the closure sequence, reducing propulsion. Figurative language is dense but generally coherent, though "eclipsed covenant" as a metaphor for a broken vow is strained.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs degrade momentum: "Her action was clear" / "Her method required," "This was the core" / "This quiet companionship," "she was no longer Elara alone; she was Mr. Henderson" immediately followed by another pivot. Stock metaphors ("love turned to stone," "bridge," "monument to his failure") and elevated register ("calcified into decades," "suspended breath") appear in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff. High figurative density in the closure paragraphs (crimson light, healing quiet, resonant silence) muddles rather than sharpens the final image. The resonator's mechanics (tuning dials, copper wire, quartz crystals) are described but remain vague in function—how does frequency "coax memory free" from metal?—reducing specificity where the method matters most.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with emotional beats. Information density is solid; most lines advance atmosphere or choice. However, pervasive figurative language ("wildflower hush," "velvet," "open palms," "sacred thread") crowds many beats without always adding pressure, and some phrases feel stock ("tears welled," "heart raced," "breath caught"). The final paragraph stacks metaphors ("rooted her soul," "storm's eye," "sap," "gentle endless sway") that blur rather than sharpen the closure image. Template cadence appears in the cultivation ritual ("Each dawn, she leaned..."; "Days became..."; "Weeks passed..."). These line-level slips total approximately −1.2 under the artifact pack, pulling the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, alternating short declaratives ("This was the source.") with longer accumulative clauses. Information density is generally high, each line advancing discovery or reweighting prior knowledge. However, several beats exhibit synonym churn and paraphrase loops: "gathering of echoes" is introduced, then immediately restated as "impressions swirled around him—a vortex of memory"; "accelerated growth" repeats across two paragraphs with near-identical phrasing ("blossoms erupted…leaves unfurled…fruit swelled" then "green shoots spiraled, leaves unfurled, tiny silver fruits clustered"). Template cadence in the final third—multiple "He would…" and "The…" openers—creates rhythmic monotony. Minor filter-verb stack ("felt the familiar lurch," "breath caught") in non-peak beats, acceptable but not exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with strong technical specificity ("22-knot gust," "Container Bay Seven") and varied sentence rhythm. Information density is high during survey sections. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "singular convergence" is restated multiple times without added pressure; "documented truth" recurs as scaffold. Template cadence runs appear in the mid-section ("He moved deeper... He recalled... He knelt...") and figurative language clusters without tight payoff ("shadows stretching like liquid mercury," "silence was no longer oppressive; it was a canvas"). The patch discovery beat is clean, but the closing paragraph stacks abstractions ("weight of convergence lightly," "hazy precision of documented truth") that slightly dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive overwriting with stacked metaphors and elevated diction: "cathedral of frozen time," "sculpted hush," "oscillating repose," "unfettering: the release of compressed snow, starlight, and millennia of silent witness." Template cadence appears in the middle third—"She struck…The tone erupted…The cavern absorbed…Then, the amber sheet flared…This was the unfettering"—creating a drumbeat rhythm. Paraphrase loops: "wonder's power" / "certified truth" / "essential truth: wonder is not merely beautiful, but fundamentally necessary." Figurative density in nearly every sentence during the climax obscures rather than sharpens the action. Register drift into abstract philosophical vocabulary clashes with immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.8)
    Multiple artifact clusters reduce momentum: "avalanchingly quiet" (repeated 3×), paraphrase loops ("the silence," "the hush," "the quiet"), and stacked filter constructions ("seemed to lean," "felt the Thunder-echo Range"). Template cadence appears in the final third ("He lowered… He left… Rising, Kael felt… He walked…"). Figurative language is dense without pattern-teaching or payoff—"sonic architecture," "tapestry of light," "tide of acceptance"—and mixed metaphors ("weave he had guarded, then the jagged tear") obscure rather than clarify. Information density is moderate; many lines restate emotional state without advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is moderate: many lines do double work (image + interiority), but paragraphs 10–17 form a paraphrase loop restating the collision and resolution without adding pressure. Template cadence: "The halo fragment glowed… amplified… shifted… pulsed" across multiple beats without variation. Stock metaphors appear ("winter frost," "velvet blackness") and prompt labels recur without fresh angle ("transposed empathy" × 3, "deliberate ambiguity" × 3, "lucid" × 3). No grammar errors. The final image ("workshop ablaze with gentle radiance," "printed not words, but wisdom") edges into purple abstraction. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loop and template stems; −0.3 for stock phrasing and label churn. Total moderate line-level debt.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("frost-rimed stones," "spun moonlight roots"), but the final third suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. "The pendant had not just extended a memory—it had germinated his purpose anew" and "He no longer felt Elara's absence as a void, but as a carefully planted seed" restate the same insight in adjacent paragraphs. The closing sequence uses identical stems ("He understood," "He continued," "He walked") across five sentences. Figurative density ("rivers of shimmering celestial fire," "living bridge built across the fade") is high throughout without clear escalation payoff; mixed metaphor risk (fade as temporal construct, bridge as spatial) slightly muddies sense. Stock metaphors ("hollow space," "quiet prayer") appear at opening and closing.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clear and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery ("feathery dendrites," "tiny prism reflecting"). However, several paraphrase loops weaken density: "firmly grounded" appears three times in similar phrasing; "shifted hush" is named twice without functional variation; "the truthful lie" recurs as scaffold. Template cadence emerges in the final third ("He had arrived…but departed," "remained…yet…now," "stayed…but…felt") with parallel stems that dull propulsion. Figurative language is dense in the closure passage without muddle, but the cumulative scaffold and recycled anchors push the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.8)
    Sentence rhythm is controlled and varies purposefully, but the piece suffers from pervasive overwriting and template cadence that dulls momentum. High figurative density ("whispering emerald labyrinth," "veils of weeping moss," "raveling silence," "time's tyranny," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry") appears in most sentences without pattern-taught payoff, creating decorative rather than propulsive texture. Repeated stems and synonym loops: "The raveling silence" / "raveling silence itself" / "no longer raveling"; "stoically sparkling" recurs three times with minor variation; "weave/woven/weaving" appears 15+ times, often in adjacent sentences without added pressure. Paraphrase loop: "She was giving her sanctuary, her tangible now, to fuel the journey" / "this sacrifice was the necessary cost of connection" restate the same content. Mixed metaphor: "raveling silence" both "consumes" and is later "gathered" and "transformed"—the vehicle shifts from antagonist to material without clear logic. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt the weight," "seeing a blueprint") in a high-pressure beat (the clearing-the-loom moment) dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure sequence ("stoically sparkling" in the final image, "time's mended tapestry" in the penultimate line), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with no grammar errors or pronoun confusion. However, repetitive stems and synonym loops appear across beats: "quietly determined resolve," "quiet determination," "quietly determined" recur without fresh texture; "azure" appears nine times, often in the same phrase slot (e.g., "azure light," "azure radiance," "azure-lit sky," "azure defiance"). Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "the earth trembled; vibrant roots surged…lifting fragments" restates the ritual's effect without added causal detail. Figurative density is high but not always purposeful; "threads swirling like liquid starlight" and "waves of warmth seeping into the stone" are vivid yet decorative at the peak beat, lowering information density. No clarity-breaking artifacts touch the closure, so penalties remain within-band.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythm varies across beats. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "The violent shifts stilled. A single vision crystallized" closely restates emotional resolution already implicit in "harmonized with the chaos." Stock metaphors cluster in the closure paragraph ("anchor of profound... love," "compass reforged," "foundation upon which to build") without fresh vehicle or specificity. Template cadence runs through several beats: "She stood... She had come... She had not..." The final third relies on tell-heavy summary ("integrated its weight into her soul") that dulls immediacy at the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("moonlight bled," "spectral rainbows," "luminescent ache," "warmth bloomed," "gentle, persistent glow") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5). Template cadence appears in adjacent descriptive stems ("the profound absence," "the dust motes," "the western windowsill"). Paraphrase loops occur ("bottled the feeling" recurs without added pressure). Line-level clarity is strong, but density of ornament and repeated stems lower the score. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so cap at −0.8 total.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense in many beats, but high figurative density without variation ("emerald lighthouse drank the starlight," "wind began to keen its rising song," "waves unclenched their white fists") creates a consistently elevated register that flattens tonal modulation. Paraphrase loops appear: "shadowed elation" is named three times with minimal reweighting, and "ancient shadows" recurs as a phrase without evolving meaning. The final paragraph includes minor scaffold ("No headline would celebrate this; no algorithm would note…") that tells theme rather than trusting the image. No major clarity breaks, but momentum sags under ornamental weight in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level craft is polished: varied sentence openings, strong sensory nouns, clean grammar. Information density is high in the wing-transformation sequence (lines 158–168). However, template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "She recalled fragments... Why did narratives cling... Her gaze followed... Dust motes danced... Time softened..." (lines 106–148) cycles through similar stems. Paraphrase loops: lines 80 ("stilled into watchful anticipation") and 92 ("quietly explosive... stilled") reiterate interior state without added pressure. Figurative density is high ("liquid-gold path," "chromatic truth," "empathetic space") yet some metaphors border on stock ("shard of fallen sky"). The final third sustains elevated diction without modulation, dulling propulsion. Applying template-cadence (−0.4) and paraphrase-loop (−0.2) penalties totaling −0.6, plus elevated-register uniformity (−0.3) = −0.9 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and the prose is largely clean, but several patterns recur: "the x of y" constructions ("weight of grief," "column of pure moonlight," "story of its healing"), polysyndeton in lists ("root and memory," "joy...regret...melodies"), and elevated abstractions in peak beats ("quantified sorrow," "profound connection," "shared humanity") that tell rather than embody. Information density is uneven—long atmospheric sentences front-load description while key actions (dream-mapping, sextant activation) compress into summary. The pin's fall is vivid and specific, a strong anchoring detail. No major loops or scaffolding, but "quantified sorrow" appears five times as a label rather than evolving through imagery. Clarity remains high; momentum sags in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is lyric and mostly clear, but figurative density in high-pressure beats—"loose thread threatening to unravel," "fragile bridge across silence," "bound release was visceral," "gentle expansion of purpose fulfilled"—stacks metaphors without always sharpening action. Template cadence appears: "Her mind was a shattered loom: fragments…"; "Her motivation was a quiet ember…"; "This ritual demanded the method…"; "This was the core concept made manifest…" (four adjacent paragraphs open with similar stems). Paraphrase loops: "scattered memories began to align" → "mosaic mind settle—not seamless, but stronger for its scars, each fragment now a deliberate stitch." Minor reduction in momentum; −0.6 for template cadence, −0.2 for paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is largely clean and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory anchors and no major grammatical errors. However, paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("hiding had been her bridge" / "crumpled paper her compass"; "no longer hiding, but waiting" / "no longer leaving, but welcoming"), and template-cadence runs ("She would…" x3 in the final third) flatten momentum. Stock metaphors ("leaf on a stream," "seed in cracked earth") and elevated register in peak beats ("enlarged tranquility," "nestled paradox" repeated as abstract label) reduce immediacy. Information density is moderate; some scaffold sentences restate without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and sentences vary in structure. Information density is solid—most lines advance image, ritual, or emotional charge. However, minor paraphrase loops appear: lines 148 and 261 echo "tenuous absolution" without meaningful reweighting between them; lines 223 and 235 both affirm the transformation of the crust. Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally stacks ("steam like a blessing," "baptism of sorrow and hope") in adjacent beats without clear pattern-teaching. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs, but the lyricism occasionally prioritizes cadence over propulsion, slightly dulling momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies well, sentence openings are diverse, and information density is high. However, overwriting patterns accumulate: "gently meticulous" appears twice in quick succession, "luminous vow" recurs without variation, and figurative language ("quartz hush," "whispered defiance," "mathematical elegy") appears in nearly every high-pressure beat without pattern-teaching or a final payoff that transforms the motif. Template cadence in the final third: "As long as…, she would…" repeated three times is purposeful parallelism but borders on mechanical. Mixed metaphor: "stitched in time's unraveling tapestry" contradicts itself (stitching vs. unraveling). These issues deduct cumulatively in Q7 (−0.6 for density and coherence, −0.3 for template cadence touching closure), lowering the score despite otherwise strong clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies well; no template cadence runs. Information density is high in the intervention beats. However, lines 70 and 82 contain paraphrase loops ("not vengeance but understanding" restated as "dual vow"). "Comforting unease" recurs four times, risking synonym fatigue. Line 267 ("thwarted betrayal through false starts, preserving peace while capturing its fragile anatomy") summarizes rather than advancing, a scaffold line. The closure image itself is clean. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "weaving the hush back" works, though "quilted from shared secrets" (implied at line 30) and "anatomy" at 267 strain slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with strong sensory imagery (lavender blooms, ozone's crisp promise, warm honey) and purposeful rhythm modulation. Several passages exhibit paraphrase loops and template cadence: "the forest erupted in synchronized gold—the election concluded, choosing compassion—and the aurora surged in triumphant reply" restates convergence across multiple lines without adding new pressure. The phrase "terrestrially cosmic" appears four times, creating decorative repetition rather than earned motif work. Figurative density is high throughout ("silent rivers of jade and violet," "lavender sighed," "moisture coalesced") without always advancing pressure, and the final third stacks metaphors ("steeped in futuristic nostalgia," "weather of peace woven from memory and moment") that blur specificity. Information density is uneven; some beats do double work while others linger on atmospheric description.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high across most beats: "phantom limb," "cold metaphor made metal," "dam of suppressed emotion shattered," "alchemized into quiet hope," "compass needle pointing… toward life itself," with multiple metaphors per paragraph that elevate diction but compete for coherence (lock as metaphor *and* physical key, creativity as river *and* light through crystal). Template cadence appears in paired constructions ("not of despair, but of release"; "not as a burden, but as a compass"; "not as an echo, but as a beginning") and in the final third's repeated stems ("The calling was answered," "She would sketch," "creativity… now flowed"). Paraphrase loop: the lock's dual role (securing chest vs. revealing truth) is restated across two sentences in paragraph 16 without added pressure. Clarity remains high until the closure paragraph, where stacked abstract claims ("enduring connection flowing back," "legacy, love, life itself," "quiet, enduring hope") replace concrete image with summary, and the final line's metaphor recycles an earlier vehicle ("light through crystal") without fresh inflection. Combined artifacts and figurative muddle in peak beats warrant deduction; the closure image is diluted by explanatory summary rather than landing as a single charged action or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm and vivid imagery. Deductions: paraphrase loops appear ("lost conversations were not stored here—they lived"; "not as an archivist of words, but as a gardener of moments" recycles the same conceptual beat), and template cadence runs cluster in the chamber scene ("No vault… Only a circular chamber… But as Elara stepped…"). Figurative density in the opening and closing paragraphs (wilting vines, night-blooming cereus, compass needle) borders on overwriting without always doing multiple jobs. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for figurative excess near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is imagistically rich. Orientation is clear. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "glisten" is invoked five times with minimal variation; "truth" and "wonder" recur as abstract labels rather than concretely anchored. Template stems ("This was," "This glisten was," "This was preservation") and synonym churn ("quiet," "muted," "silence") reduce density. Peak beats ("As the solstice sun peaked…" through "The first bell chimed") carry stacked modifiers and elevated register that slow momentum. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically varied in most beats, with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high in the ritual sequence. Three artifact types harm momentum: (1) paraphrase loops—lines 115/122/129 restate "controlled burn" and "containment" with synonym churn; (2) template cadence in lines 199/207/214 (identical "The [object] [verb], then [result]" stems); (3) scaffolding phrases like "This was the action of miniaturize" (line 182) and "This was fragmented wholeness" (line 276) that label rather than dramatize. These touch the closure third, so baseline −1.0 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates between lyric description and scene beats. However, multiple lines loop conceptually: "The locked mailbox mystery dissolved not through force, but through the cumulative grace of stories heard and honored" immediately follows the photograph placement that already demonstrated this dissolution. Figurative density is high throughout ("pressed flower," "stitches to truth," "tapestry of reconciliation") without pattern-teaching, drifting toward overwriting in the final third. The phrase "dust motes dancing in the sunbeam" is a stock image, and "voice thick with unexpected emotion" tells rather than shows the official's shift. These artifacts dull momentum at the closure beat, triggering a −0.6 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high across most beats: "loom weaving meaning," "silken thread," "spider spins its web," "cradle of hope," "silent poem," "seismic gesture." Register drifts elevated ("lyrical code breaker," "mysterious familiarity," "seawater's ancient pulse") without grounding in Elara's lexicon. Paraphrase loops appear: "fear into action, vulnerability into strength" echoes "encrypt vulnerability as strength"; "quiet vow" / "calm defiance" / "quiet triumph" / "quiet rebellion" recycle the same idea. Template stems: "She was," "She had," "She danced," "She approached" stack without variation. Deductions: density without pattern-teaching −0.5, register drift −0.4, paraphrase loops −0.3, template cadence −0.4 = cumulative −1.6 applied once in Q7 per policy. Artifacts touch closure paragraph ("silent poem," "seismic gesture"), preventing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structure and vivid imagery ("salt flowed like liquid glass," "star-dusted sky"). Information density is high; nearly every line advances setting, character, or atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "gleaming silence" recurs four times across the story without meaningful reweighting; "pressed wildflowers" are described redundantly in adjacent beats; and the closing two paragraphs restate the same thematic point (memories reclaimed, silence transformed, light tended). Template cadence runs in the chamber sequence ("She navigated... her eyes fixed... Her purpose burned"). These artifacts dull momentum at closure and prevent higher scoring. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems (Q7 only, per non-closure accumulation cap).

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.1)
    Template cadence pervades: "She [verb]" openers recur across the piece without purposeful variation. Paraphrase loops are frequent ("smoothed hush" appears five times with synonym churn: "pure silence," "clean, clear silence," "smoothed hush lingered"). Mixed metaphors ("tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic") clash in register and vehicle logic. Figurative density stacks in peak beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring causal clarity. Sentence-level word counts in brackets [13, 14, etc.] are generation artifacts but do not obscure text; no penalty applied for their presence.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and strong imagery (gargoyle offering key, meteor scratching sky). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "agreed upon lies" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure; "patiently nimble" recurs as decorative label. Template cadence in the final third: "She had come to interrogate stone, but…" / "She was no longer an outsider…" / "She had sought to interrogate stone, but left understanding soul." Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching, and some metaphors stretch ("verbs in the building's living tongue"). These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats and trigger accumulated line-level penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.9)
    Density is high but clarity suffers under figurative stacking: "ghostly resolve: a spectral determination woven from sorrow and hope, fragile yet unyielding as spider silk" compounds metaphors without concrete payoff. Paraphrase loops appear ("archive the memory, not to erase it, but to integrate"; "translate… isolation… into… independence" restated multiple times). Elevated diction ("quarantined memory," "tragically radiant," "resonance structures") pervades peak beats, creating register drift from the empirical skeptic's established lens. Template cadence runs in ritual description ("The resonance structures answered… The quarantined memory surged… The central quartz rod flared"). Information density is strong, but propulsion is slowed by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual and tonal shifts. Information density is moderate—many lines layer image and interiority, but some beats paraphrase without advancing pressure (e.g., "He forgave the rushed ink, the unintended consequence, the friend he could not save" restates prior reflections). Minor template cadence appears in the ritual sequence ("A soft *click* resonated... The key... gleamed... He inserted it. It turned...") but does not obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold mar the closure beat. Figurative language is present in most sentences ("frozen tears," "liquid starlight," "velvet" silence) and occasionally stacks without pattern-teaching, edging toward overwriting. The piece is clean and legible but lacks the propulsion and density required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant overwriting and template artifacts throughout. "Richly perceptive" appears twice as a label without dramatization; "reed-blown melancholy" recurs three times without evolving function. The phrase "web of intrigue" is used four times, often paraphrasing the same concept. Stock constructions proliferate: "tears traced clean paths," "her heart swelling," "dawn's first light tinged the highest rim with rose and gold." Filter-verb stacks ("she knew," "she understood," "she recalled") dull immediacy in key beats. The closure paragraph summarizes emotion ("profound quiet," "hard-won understanding") rather than anchoring it in a concrete image. Paraphrase loops ("the web of intrigue was a tapestry of love, greed, and regret" / "the tangled web of intrigue was gently unraveled") and synonym churn reduce propulsion. Deductions: overwriting density −0.7, paraphrase loops −0.4, filter stacks in peak beats −0.5, template cadence −0.6, stock metaphors touching closure −0.8. Total accumulated penalties exceed −2.0; applying the cap at −2.0 and routing artifacts that touch closure results in a score in the mid-4s. Additionally, the artifacts appear in the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the stated rule.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and rhythm are strong; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is dense but controlled (candles "guttered," glass "slumped like a frozen tear," snow globe "shaking with perfect snow"). However, several beats repeat content without added pressure: "salvage something pure" is restated across multiple paragraphs, and the borrowed-starlight metaphor recurs in similar phrasing without evolving function. Information density is high early but plateaus mid-piece; the dream sequence and letter-writing could compress. The cumulative word-count markers are bracketed scaffolding tokens, ignored per rubric, but their presence signals generator seams.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is vivid without clutter. However, the piece contains notable phrase-loop patterns: "hidden effort" appears nine times, "hidden patterns" five times, often in adjacent or nearby lines without new pressure (e.g., lines 73, 117, 139, 148, 158, 189, 199, 328, 333). Template cadence in the final third recycles "The [noun]..." openers across multiple beats. "Scintillatingly somber" is reused identically (lines 95, 225, 343) without reweighting. Figurative density in peak beats (liquid affirmation, perpetual benediction, fragile tapestry) leans decorative. Overall propulsion is clean, but scaffold and stock metaphor reduce tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or stakes. However, several paraphrase loops and synonym variations appear: "excavate truth from comfortable lies" echoed in "benevolent deception," "protective myth," "sacred falsehood," and "necessary secret" across beats without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "She would become...," "She had come...," "The flawed diamond stayed...." Figurative language ("ochre storm scouring," "covenant with the future") occasionally overreaches. Clarity remains strong; no causality breaks. Deductions total approximately −1.3 for loops and cadence artifacts, capping potential.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high, but several lines carry template cadence: "Her sanctuary, a stormlit observatory above clouds, hummed..." opens with appositive structure echoed in "This object was her lens, her oracle..." and "Her motivation burned with quiet ferocity..." (−0.4). "The timeframe of her vigil spanned the very rise of Prophet Kael—a man of absolute clarity whose doctrine..." stacks modifiers and risks register drift into exposition. The vault discovery beat ("Tears of awe fell as children traced carvings of forgotten crops—a tangible hope unearthed from shadow and whisper") is vivid but "tears of awe" and "tangible hope" edge toward stock phrasing (−0.3). No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. The final image is clean and propulsive. Cumulative artifact penalty in Q7: −0.7.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and carries a consistent lyric texture, but suffers from heavy overwriting and loop artifacts. Nearly every sentence deploys figurative language or elevated diction without variation in density, creating a static rhythm that dulls momentum. Paraphrase loops appear frequently (e.g., "sacred method" / "sacred purpose," "translator" recurs across multiple beats, "positively wistful" appears twice). Template cadence is visible in repeated "He [verb]" stems across the middle third. Stock metaphors ("dust motes danced," "tears traced paths," "igniting the jars like captured sunsets") and therapy-speak labels ("grief-stricken silence," "deep peace," "emotional release") flatten peak beats. The closing five paragraphs recycle the same thematic assertion without new information or image work, constituting a paraphrase loop that obscures the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with mixed success: "shard of frozen midnight," "liquid silver," "ghost-memory of sunset" work, but "fleshly ethereal" and "sonic absolution" are repeated to the point of mantra without evolving meaning. Template cadence runs appear in the climax: "Strike, listen, refine. Each iteration was..." and "This was vibrational matching: she listened... This was sonic absolution: dissonance not destroyed..." Paraphrase loops touch the closure beats (paragraph describing "fleshly ethereal" near the end restates prior material). Bracketed word counts ([239, [356) are generation artifacts and ignored per rubric, but the scaffold phrasing they bookend is not. Deductions: figurative density −0.5, template cadence −0.6, paraphrase loop −0.4, touching closure −0.1 escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several beats carry paraphrase loops: the concept of patient revolution is restated multiple times across lines 62, 77, 220, 255, 287 with diminishing new detail. Template cadence appears in the sequence of short declarative sentences describing the ritual (lines 184–234). Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent, though occasional mixed registers ("impatience hummed like a trapped bird" followed by "internal forge") create minor friction. The ending beat is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.2)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs are present: "the controlling influence," "fortified vulnerability," "entangled memories," and "preventable death" recur without evolving meaning. The final third stacks summary and declaration ("she would present," "she would be," "the controlling influence would shatter") in place of scene. Label-heavy interiority ("watchful calm held firm," "emotional drought was ending") dulls immediacy in peak beats. Figurative language is functional but not dense enough to obscure causality; the primary issue is scaffold repetition and summarized closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance multiple jobs. But figurative language clusters heavily: "silent prayers," "physical echo," "divine precision," "silent sermon," "vibrant hush" recurs three times. Lines 173–191 layer metaphor on metaphor without pattern-teaching, creating register drift at the climax. Paraphrase loops appear: lines 135 and 159 both describe Horvath's voice with similar texture. Template cadence: "He [verb]" structure repeats across multiple paragraphs (146, 159, 227). Apply −0.6 for density and −0.4 for loops, totaling −1.0 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with nearly every beat carrying metaphor or elevated diction: "stubborn flea on a furious green beast," "geometry of liquid light," "bell ringing in the key of pure potential," "silent spaces between heartbeats." While many images are vivid, the accumulation without variation in register creates a texture that reads overwrought, particularly in peak beats where clarity would serve better. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions: "No ear in the present could hear it, but the universe had leaned in" / "unheard, undeniable, and utterly new." Paraphrase loops surface: "She hadn't just built a machine; she had taught longing how to sing" restates the thematic claim already embedded in prior lines. Information density is moderate; many sentences layer description without advancing situation or narrowing options, slowing momentum despite the brevity. Applying artifact penalties: elevated diction at peaks −0.4, template-cadence runs −0.4, paraphrase loop −0.2, total deduction ~−1.0 in Q7, plus general density drag.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity and momentum are generally clean, but paraphrase loops and template cadence appear in the final third: "Some absences were not voids to fill, but sacred spaces to honor" (224) closely mirrors "keeper of echoes, guardian of intentional silence" (269) and "Her official report stated the case remained unsolved, a respectful omission. The lie was now guardianship" (210) repeats the concept without added pressure. Sentence stems repeat: "She [verb]" opens six consecutive clauses in the middle section. Information density is high early but thins during the closure epilogue (lines 224–304), where summary restates the stance shift rather than charging a final image with new cost. Minor deduction for figurative muddle: "threads catching the low light like a promise" (218) mixes vehicle (threads as fiber) with tenor (promise as covenant) without clear coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically varied, but suffers from pervasive figurative density that obscures clarity at pressure points. Runs of elevated modifier strings ("shadow-laced," "salt-weathered," "dew-kissed," "sun-warmed") create a consistent texture but flatten momentum through decorative accumulation. Key beats rely on abstract process summary ("channeled the emotional resonance," "reconstitution was complete") instead of concrete action, and the closure sequence stacks assertions ("wave of golden light erupted," "branches shimmered," "buds swelled and burst forth") without the embodied particularity that would make transformation visceral. Template cadence appears in parallel glimpse descriptions and in the final catalogue of changes. Paraphrase loops cluster around thematic claims ("courage as the conscious choice," "empathy onto action").

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled in most beats. Overwriting cluster in final third: "violet and rose gold," "star-dusted sky," "dawn's promise," "eternal song of memory, grace, and continuing light" stack metaphors without fresh particulars, triggering −0.5. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 12–13 restate the sound's nature ("not void, but resonance" / "textured, layered, alive") without added pressure, −0.2. Minor template cadence in transitions ("She recalled," "She would," "She understood"). Information density is high in early beats (net work, parasol tip anchor) but the final quarter summarizes emotional shifts rather than dramatizing them. No causality breaks; artifacts cluster in closure zone, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every paragraph stacks metaphor or elevated phrasing ("rustle of crimson leaves," "sacred geometry," "gnarled bones"). Paraphrase loops appear (paragraphs restating Elara's purpose, the mismatch theme). Stock phrases accumulate: "breath hitched," "heart swelled," "voice cracked." Template cadence runs through multiple "She [verb]" and "Elara [verb]" sentence openers. These artifacts dull momentum and touch the closure paragraphs, where "passionate subtlety" is named rather than enacted. Filter-verb stacks ("she watched," "she saw," "she thought") flatten immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative language or elevated abstraction ("embers cooling in twilight," "subterranean heartbeat," "iron to a magnet of pure intent"), creating density without propulsion. Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "He did not command the center; he sanctified the space around it" restates the prior paragraph's content. Template cadence appears in the final third with repeated clause structures ("Kael rose... Kael understood... Kael disappeared"). Stock metaphors—"embers," "magnet," "tapestry"—accumulate without fresh specificity. Filter verbs ("felt the echo pulse," "feeling the parapet's pulse") dull immediacy in peak ritual beats.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is mostly intact, but line-level craft suffers from paraphrase loops, stock metaphors, and template cadence. "Lavender field," "resilient vines," "dove gray map case," and "perceptively calm" recur as decorative anchors without evolving syntactically. Sentence stems repeat: "Elara [verb]," "She [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]" across multiple paragraphs. Stock images ("emerald tapestries," "threads of starlight," "mosaic of hope") blur specificity. The final third contains near-duplicate statements: "Her work was complete" is restated in "the puzzle... had been reassembled into a mosaic of hope" and again in "the field would remain a sanctuary." Information density is moderate; some beats advance atmosphere more than plot. No causality break, so penalties remain in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity is high and information density is generally good, but several patterns recur: "suspended hush" appears four times with similar phrasing, and the sentences describing the crystal's discovery and Aris's method rely on parallel construction that trends toward template cadence. Figurative language is frequent ("frozen constellation," "sonic tapestry," "clean paths through dust") and occasionally stacks without functional differentiation. The final paragraphs compress summary ("his own growth finally decoded") rather than extending the image. No major loops, but textural density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is imagistic and rhythmically varied in peak beats: "the gentle creak of wood breathing through decades of quiet moments." Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or ritual. However, paraphrase loops appear: "echoes of growing older" recurs without reweighting, and the closing paragraph cycles through near-synonyms ("return…gather…arrange…chase") in template stems. "Tidal longing" appears four times without functional shift. The final three "She would" constructions form a scaffold loop that dulls closure propulsion. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "mist coalescing" and "fog sculpture" work, though "supernova clarity" for visions feels overstated.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence ("tectonic groan," "razor-edge," "silver-blurred frenzy," "soul's threshold," "cratered pearl," "luminous ache"), creating density that occasionally obscures propulsion. Mixed metaphor: "sewing chaos into time" (chaos is not sewn). Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 5–6 both tell us Elara seeks to capture fleeting phenomena without added pressure. The final third contains thematic summary ("she understood true escape velocity") that restates what the leaf image had already shown. Template cadence in the closing: "She had harnessed… by preserving… / The shaking foundations had not destroyed; they had revealed…" reads like parallel summary rather than scene. No severe opacity, but the prose labors under its own ornament and some beats would benefit from leaner syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("grief a stone in her throat," "her voice a warm thread stitching ordinary moments into grace"), but several metaphors stack without clear propulsion ("pulsing stillness," "radiant haven," "liquid gold," "deep water certainty" all in the opening). Paraphrase loops appear: "pulsing stillness" recurs three times, "flawless goodbye" twice, and the final third restates the thematic frame ("wholehearted emblem," "gentle note sustained," "enduring scent of hope") in near-synonyms. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "Elara [verb]," and the closing lines loop thematic summary rather than compress. Propulsion stalls under the weight of decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; the orrery mechanics and rune-correction sequence advance clearly. Minor loops appear: "quietly deliberate" recurs three times, "The celestial loop was closed" immediately followed by "In that instant of perfect completion" paraphrases the same closure moment, and "shadowed… sheltered… conserving" in the sanctuary description stacks near-synonyms. The parenthetical word counts at line ends are generation artifacts but do not obscure meaning. Overall clarity is strong, but the loops and a few stock phrases ("tears tracing clean paths") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries thematic weight but suffers from loops and template phrasing. "Cleft" appears three times in close proximity (cleft in the root, cleft in certainty, cleft in certainty again), and several sentences restate concepts: "mistakes, met with courage, could become constellations" echoes "turn this painful collective mistake into a constellation." Participial openers recur ("Clutched in her palm," "Rising, she smoothed"). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff, and some metaphors are strained ("constellation of understanding," "cartographer of grace"). The closure image is clear but the path to it is weighted with scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs reduce propulsion. "A profound realization settled" / "a promise that light could be offered" / "the quiet certainty that this light" recycle the same affirmation across three beats. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "pearl of stillness," "zephyr bloom," "aqueous radiance," "pocket-sized sanctuary" stack without creating friction or comic contrast. Register drift into abstract philosophical phrasing ("distill the vast cosmos into an intimate, shareable grace") clashes with the grounded polishing action. Several sentences restate emotional state rather than advance it, dulling momentum in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, repeated abstract phrases ("honeyed hush" appears five times, "quietly proactive" twice, "watchful dreamer" thrice) create minor synonym loops. The final third summarizes rather than propels ("She would return tomorrow…"). Template cadence in the closing sequence: "The watchful dreamer smiled… Her quiet proactivity… And in that protected vulnerability…" These runs of declarative thesis statements dull momentum. No causality breaks, so penalties remain in Q7. Figurative language is consistent but occasionally stacks without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.6)
    Template cadence dominates the cameo sequence: "A [descriptor] [noun] [verb]; [character], their hope a [metaphor]—a cameo for [Name]" repeats across six beats with only synonym churn distinguishing them, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty (−1.2) and global 9+ disqualification. Paraphrase loops ("inside the whisper of closing pages" appears three times; "swirling hush" twice; "against the current" five times) reduce information density without taught pattern or payoff. Stock metaphor strings ("hope a tangible thread of gold," "hope a constellation of unanswered questions") blur sense. The final third contains these artifacts, disallowing 9+ across all categories and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.1)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence in the opening and closing carries metaphor or elevated diction ("bled softly," "benevolent amber eye," "whimsical tinkerer," "liquid gold unspooled," "ghostly pearl") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density penalties (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear: "gathering hush" is declared twice (opening and penultimate paragraph), and "the forgotten songs were now remembered" repeats the premise mid-closure without advancing it. Template cadence runs in the ritual sequence ("With each verse... the golden thread spun"; "Light seeped... sealing"; "wilted ferns straightened") follow identical structures across three lines (−0.5). Figurative language in peak beats is mixed: "liquid gold unspooled" and "weaving patterns only the heart could decipher" clash registers. Combined artifacts and loops: baseline −1.2, escalated to −1.7 because they touch the closure beat (the grapes, the final hush). Global 9+ disallowed per artifact-in-final-third rule.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. However, overwriting clusters appear in high-pressure beats: "a beam of safekept starlight, drawn by the crater's geometry and her pattern, descended like a needle of pure potential" stacks metaphor ("beam," "needle," "potential") without adding clarity. Template cadence surfaces in the climax sequence ("This was the anchor," "This was the seal," "The world exhaled"). Paraphrase loop: "The paper transformed, humming with warm, persistent energy—a living map pulsing with golden roots and silver veins" restates transformation already shown. Apply −0.6 for patterned artifacts touching the closure beat and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies across the dawn-to-dusk structure, and sensory detail is concrete. However, paraphrase loops appear: lines 269 and 283 restate the peripheral-insight theme, and the final two paragraphs (315–338) recycle "echoes safe," "cellar," and "wonder" without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the observation beats (dawn/mid-morning/noon/dusk) reads mechanical. Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff (e.g., "liquid starlight," "swirled into glass vials"), applying −0.5 for overwriting in a non-crisis beat and −0.3 for the paraphrase loop.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high—"shingled hush," "boundary-lessly trapped anxiety," "calcify," "whalebone reverie," "granulating into faint, crystalline sparks"—across most sentences without a taught pattern or clear payoff, triggering overwriting concerns (−0.5). Register drift into elevated abstraction ("boundary-lessly," "permeation") at peak beats adds −0.3. Paraphrase loop: "The kerosene lamp burner provided… / The kerosene lamp burner flared… / The kerosene lamp burner guttered…" recycles the same anchor without new pressure (−0.2). Template cadence: "She began to weave… / She wove with increasing precision… / She placed it…" runs across multiple beats with parallel stems (−0.4). Total artifact debt ≈−1.4 in Q7; artifacts do not obscure closure but pervade the weaving sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and sensory detail is vivid, but the piece carries pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops. Multiple adjacent sentences restate the same idea: "This ash blank...was chosen for resilience and grace" / "Her motivation was clear: to harvest lessons from loss" / "She sought to contain the essence of 'here and gone'"; "The carving was not a portrait, but an essence" / "a vessel forged to contain crystallized time" / "She had contained the memory not to trap sorrow." These loops dull momentum in the final third, and figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff. Stock metaphor strings ("sharp edges," "seeds," "ghosts") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she knew") further reduce immediacy. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, plus −0.3 for filter-verb density.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several prose artifacts accumulate. Stock metaphors appear without transformation: "tears welled," "inner storms," "translucent fingers." Register drifts into abstract philosophical language in peak beats: "unified wholeness," "compassionate purpose," "integrated time." Paraphrase loops appear: cumulative 163 and 171 both describe compromise as erosion with similar phrasing. The piece avoids template cadence but relies on participial openers and "as" constructions that flatten some moments. The figurative density in the opening (liquid mercury, tapestry, amber/obsidian) front-loads imagery without clear payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance setting, action, or interiority. The prose is largely clean with vivid specifics ("tarnished fragment," "corroded bolts," "slanted light"). However, several template patterns recur: "Her [noun] [verb]" structures cluster in the middle third ("Her gaze caught," "Her functionally creative mind surged," "Her movements were reverent"), and synonym loops appear ("stoic determination," "stoic wonder," "reverent"). The bracketed cumulative word counts are generation artifacts but do not obscure causality. "Functionally creative" is used three times as a stock descriptor without fresh embodiment. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "liquid constellation" and "shimmering star chart" work, though "maze of intentions" in the premise paragraph is abstract. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and synonym churn per the artifact pack, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    Density is high and most lines do double duty (scent + memory, crystal + choice). Figurative language pervades: "glacial hush," "petrichor nostalgia," "excruciatingly gentle" appear in most high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching, risking decorative layering (−0.5). Paraphrase loops surface: "glacial hush" recurs four times, "excruciatingly gentle/gently" three times, "soundless sanctuary" bookends without functional evolution (−0.4 template cadence). "Petrichor" appears thrice in close succession. These artifacts cluster but do not obscure causality at closure, so deduction remains in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong figurative control in places ("sky bleeding from amber to deep indigo," "wood groaning softly beneath her worn boots like a shared sigh") and information density is generally high. However, template cadence and paraphrase loops pervade: "thoughtfully clear focus honed through solitude" and "This attribute of clarity was her hard-won shield" restate the same idea; "serene upheaval" appears three times without functional variation; "architecture of lies" recurs in identical phrasing across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("fires of public ridicule," "key turning in a rusted lock," "cathedral of deceit") cluster in the middle third without fresh specificity. Synonym churn for "clarity" (hindsight clarity, thoughtfully clear, clarity was her shield) and "errant legend seeker" → "guardian of authenticity" labels reduce propulsion. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack for loops, template cadence, and stock metaphor strings in peak beats: baseline −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but coherent ("lightning-forged vessel," "map of wind and water"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or discovery. However, paraphrase loops appear: "oceanic hush" recurs three times without reweighting; "the golden dock seemed to sigh, snow glittering like scattered promises" and "the harbor held its breath" are near-synonyms within three paragraphs. Template cadence in the final third ("She carried… She knew… Each step felt…") stacks four consecutive subject-verb openings, and the closing lines ("tiny ark of memory sailing steadily toward tomorrow") border on purple without adding causal pressure. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence; −0.3 for register drift in peak reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language pervades almost every sentence, creating density without always advancing causality: "autumn had bled the maples bare," "bruised sky," "shattered stained glass," "geography of healing," "atlas," "pilgrimage," "map," "compass," "topography." The metaphor system (cartography of emotion) becomes repetitive and borders on overwriting, particularly in peak beats where clarity would serve better. Template cadence appears in the vision sequence: "She saw... She felt... The explained absence was revealed..." Paraphrase loops occur in the final third, restating that Elara now understands without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative density is high and often beautiful, but metaphors stack in most sentences without pattern-teaching or pressure payoff ("sea of mist," "bridge over chasm," "spider-silk at sunrise"), triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "assemble conditions" / "assembled apparatus," "flawed genesis" repeated across beats without evolution. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "He [verb]." Clarity is mostly intact, but momentum drags under ornamental layering. Key beats (shell cracking, bird dissolving) are shown but lack propulsive syntax. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("fragile thing like spider-silk"), disallowing 9+ globally and escalating Q7 penalty to −1.7 range.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative language pervades nearly every paragraph without pattern-teaching or payoff under pressure: "migration of clouds," "shadows that drifted like memories," "gravity—a choice," "tapestry of unyielding compassion," "vein of hope." This density flattens propulsion and obscures causality in peak beats. Paraphrase loops recur: "scars can sing" appears three times with minor variation; "unyielding compassion" repeats without accumulation. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens nine sentences across the text. Filter verbs cluster in reflective beats ("she knew," "she sought"). Sentence rhythm varies but the elevated register creates tonal uniformity that dulls the ritual's visceral stakes. The final third artifacts (stacked metaphors, synonym churn on "song"/"melody"/"tune") harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph structure serves the quest progression. Clarity is generally strong, though figurative density is high throughout ("bruised twilight," "silent comma," "liquid light," "star-measured waiting") with mixed metaphors in a few beats (geese as both comma and key-turning cry). Template cadence appears in repeated "At the X fountain, she Y" constructions across the middle third. Paraphrase loops: "defiant hush" recurs five times with slight variation, and "realistically imaginative" appears three times as a label. Stock metaphors: "tears trace clean paths through dust" and "rivers of memory." Information density is good; no major scaffold. Deductions for pattern-artifact (template stems, figurative stack) and some ornamental repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language (starlight tears, nebula as garden). Paraphrase loops appear: "The troubling serenity now held acceptance" closely echoes prior "troubling serenity" mentions without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]," and thematic statements recur ("approximating infinity," "generational patterns") without evolving. The final eight paragraphs summarize rather than dramatize, reducing momentum. Line-level artifacts do not obscure causality but dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished with varied rhythm and vivid images ("river of orange and black," "thundering calm"). Information density is high in the memory sequence, but several lines loop thematically: "fiercely meditative" appears twice, "sacred" recurs five times in the final third, and "shape" is repeated without fresh reweighting. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She felt... smelled... saw..."). No major clarity breaks, but the closure paragraph stacks abstractions ("burden," "compass," "sacred creation," "tribute," "hope") that dilute propulsion. Filter verbs ("watching," "knew") are present but voice-motivated and do not stack heavily.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is purposeful ("stone finger," "bronze notes cascaded") but clusters heavily in the opening and reverie, risking over-writing. Paraphrase loops appear: "restore shared balance" recurs three times with slight variation, and "incremental absolution" is echoed in "incremental wave" without adding pressure. Template cadence is minimal, but several sentences share a [subject + past verb + modifier] structure that flattens momentum in the middle third. The final paragraph stacks summary moves ("The village stirred," "Elara smiled," "Obsidian pools mirrored") that could be compressed. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but the cumulative scaffold and synonym churn ("incremental," "shared balance") lower density. Grammar and punctuation are clean; no significant clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive text-pattern artifacts: "tenderly organized" appears three times without functional variation; "velveteen gloom" recurs as a static label; paraphrase loops ("shape of intentions" / "shape of a beautiful intention"). Template cadence runs through the middle (each thread decoded → echo released → understanding accrued). Figurative language appears in most sentences of the tapestry sequence without escalation or cost. Final-paragraph moralizing ("intentions, like gardens, required tending") replaces scene pressure. Apply −1.4 for spread and −0.3 for closure-beat proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies; imagery is vivid ("ice so thick and clear that drowned pines lay visible"). Information density is moderate—each paragraph advances setup or internal state. No loops or template cadence. However, scaffold phrasing appears: "Her method was predictive modeling, a disciplined fusion…" reads expository; "Doubt, cold as the lake's surface, coiled within her" is generic metaphor. The final third stacks filter constructions ("she lifted," "she dipped," "she poised") without propulsion. Artifact penalty −0.6 for scaffold + stock metaphor in peak beat; closure image is clean but the approach lacks high-density precision.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"story famine," "thistled calm," "gardener of ghosts"—which risks overwriting in a compressed frame; the metaphors cohere but saturate nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff that alters tactics. Paraphrase loops appear: "teach dust to tell stories" is restated as "teaching cadence and metaphor" and "taught the dust a new word" across three beats without added pressure. Template cadence runs: "She was… She thought… She would…" recur in adjacent paragraphs. Information density is moderate; many lines do dual work (atmosphere + motive), but some ("Safe. For now.") stall momentum without advancing knowledge. No severe clarity breaks, yet the accumulation of figurative language and scaffold phrasing dulls immediacy in peak beats (cloak slip, broadcast fade).

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.3)
    The text is riddled with paraphrase loops and thematic echo: "mirage of safety" appears three times with minimal reweighting; "weaves truth carefully" is repeated verbatim; "somber marvel" bookends without evolving. Figurative language is stacked densely in high-concept beats ("ghost of a quivering lip," "melancholy snow," "map of truth") without concrete action to anchor it, violating the overwriting density check. Template cadence is pervasive: "She [verb]…She [verb]…She [verb]" across multiple paragraphs. The final third is especially burdened by abstraction ("threshold crossed," "ground of connection") that dilutes the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm supports accumulative pressure. Information density is high in the tablet-discovery sequence. However, several text-pattern artifacts weaken momentum: paraphrase loops ("competing narrative was not contrarianism but a vital framework" closely echoes the prior geological-survey line, ~line 81–87), template cadence in the middle third ("Each dawn, he employed…" / "Today, his brush uncovered…"), and stock metaphor strings ("keys to the past's true voice," "seed-keeper in cultural winter"). The artifacts do not obscure causality but dull the closure image's sharpness. Apply −0.6 baseline in Q7 for spread; −0.2 additional for touching final-third phrasing ("quiet certainty," "silent promise").

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and the prose is largely clean of grammatical errors. However, decorative phrasing recurs: "traveled stillness" appears four times, "expectantly resigned" twice, "subtract noise" three times, creating a template cadence that blunts momentum. The rosette is described as "denoting" twice in succession, a synonym loop. Purple touches ("her heart full of traveled stillness," "tapestry of mended threads") cluster in the final third without clear pattern payoff. Information density is moderate—many lines advance atmosphere but not plot or choice—and the "weeks passed" summary is a missed opportunity for scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is concrete ("gravel," "damp decay," "emerald leaves"). However, the final third succumbs to paraphrase loops and thematic restatement: "He had pruned despair," "he had planted resilience," "beauty required no fanfare," "his rebellion was gentle," and "true change grows slowly" all echo the same insight without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the pruning sequence ("Another prune…released…" / "Each snip was…"). The phrase "synaptic plasticity" recurs as scaffolding without variation. Stock metaphors—"cradle of renewal," "living testament," "roots drinking deep from stories"—accumulate without fresh vehicle specificity. These artifacts dull the closure image and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty: baseline −0.8 for paraphrase and template runs, and −0.3 for stock metaphor density in the final third, totaling approximately −1.1 applied here.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.3)
    Overwriting in the opening: "nectar dusk, a rare alchemy of sunset and storm-cleared air, draped the lightning collection tower in liquid gold and deep violet shadows, gilding the silent spires where the drone beehive's hum should have resonated" stacks ornament without advancing pressure (−0.4). Paraphrase loops: "preserve wonder within routine, ensuring the tower remained a cathedral of sky and science, not mere infrastructure" rephrases motivation just stated (−0.2). Cumulative word-count annotations are scaffolding tokens, ignored per rubric. Propulsion is steady in the riddle sequence; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.9)
    Significant density of figurative language in most sentences without pattern-teaching triggers overwriting concern: "boots whispered," "streetlights flickered...daydreaming of daylight," "the bay's breath kissed the garden gate," "threads of memory," "heartbeat," "testament," "sanctuary," "prayer," "alchemy," "seeds in fertile soil"—the metaphoric load is heavy and some vehicles contradict (streetlights cannot both "daydream of daylight" and serve as "guardians of the hush"). Template cadence appears in parallel structure: "The water lay still...the air carried...the streetlights flickered." Paraphrase loops: "a quiet blaze of intentional love" and "hushed blaze of understanding" restate the same concept. The scaffold phrase "not as a solution, but as a question" and the thesis-summary final paragraphs ("She understood now: aliveness was not in the structure...") slow momentum. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty, but the closure paragraphs recycle the insight across multiple restatements. No major causality breaks, so artifacts remain here.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.4)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence across adjacent sentences: "Kael projected this insight...his telepathy dissolving shame...welcoming the beautiful complexity" restates the same thematic move three times without advancing action. Stock metaphors ("golden thread stitching history's tears," "sea anemone embracing the tide") accumulate without coherent vehicle logic. Filter-verb stacks ("He felt...He visualized...He began to thread") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. The closure paragraph recycles "nuance," "certainty," and "animate" without propulsion, and the final line ("a statue animate with purpose, guarding the delicate, beautiful space where certainty learns to bend") is a thematic summary rather than an image with sensory charge.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies initially, but the final third employs heavy parallelism and fragment chains ("Each equation was a tribute. She carried the texture. It was imperfect, tender, entirely hers. The dice shifted.") that create a drumbeat effect. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "boundless confinement no longer felt like punishment but a sanctuary" is restated conceptually three times in the closing. Stock metaphors ("proofs bloomed across the stone like constellations") and scaffold phrasing ("The chipped die was no longer... It was...") reduce density. Clarity remains high, but information density drops in the extended coda.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is generally high, but several lines loop or paraphrase adjacent content: lines 265 and 277 both restate the insomnia-as-vigil shift; lines 90 and 169 both describe the lost-languages lexicon. Figurative language is frequent and mostly coherent, though "visual haiku" at line 188 and "saffron quiet" repeated thrice edge toward decorative use. Sentence openings vary, rhythm supports scene needs, and the final image is clean. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template "quiet" cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure. Information density is high in the discovery beat (opera glass → carving → silver-leaf → oral history fragment). However, several artifacts accumulate: "rosewater dread" repeated as a motif without clear physical anchor, filter-verb reliance ("her breath caught," "her mind raced"), and paraphrase loops near the ending ("The art lives," "We remember. We adapt. We endure" followed by "culture is a seed, not a relic" and "loving preservation"). Template cadence appears in the climax sequence: "People climbed... fires crackled... children shaped..." creates a listlike rhythm that flattens momentum. The final third stacks abstract declaratives that summarize rather than enact the emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high, but several passages overwrite with stacked modifiers and figurative language: "bruised twilight sky," "quiet desperation," "bleak exhilaration surged," "cool, silver-white light of startling clarity, sharp enough to carve definition." The phrase "a fusion of the stone's somber history and the thrilling proximity of revolution" is abstract and sluggish. Template cadence appears in several "As [X], [Y]" constructions. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the elevated diction in peak beats (lens ignition, stone transformation) reduces immediacy. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but density suffers from ornamental phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.2)
    Clarity is maintained but density suffers from decorative metaphor clusters in nearly every sentence ("fingers, cold as forgotten coins," "visual void that repelled light and memory," "words feeling like shards of ice"). Template cadence appears in the mirror-sequence beats ("He whispered... A choked sob echoed... The shadows coalesced"). Paraphrase loop: "He sought to unbosom" is restated multiple times without added pressure. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("undeniable clarity," "weary but whole"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the ritual sequence: "fractal generating" appears four times with minimal variation; "sketched resonance" and "dub" cycle without advancing new information. Template cadence in paragraphs 10–13 ("He knelt…etched…raised…performed," "Moving east…sketched…struck") flattens propulsion. Figurative density ("thread of intention," "audible lattice," "wave of resonance") clusters without payoff in the climax, triggering overwriting penalties. Apply −1.0 cumulative for loops and template runs touching the closure third, disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high; most lines advance world, character, or pressure. However, template cadence appears in the opening's breathless subordination and recurs in the middle third with repeated "she [verb]" constructions across contiguous beats. The phrase "pattern language" is invoked four times without functional variation, creating low-level synonym churn. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "rust flowed like liquid light" and "blooming flower" work together. The final third sustains momentum without loops, but the mid-story scaffold ("Her method was a deep engagement through pattern languages. She treated the rust's fractal lacework as deliberate text...") reads expository rather than dramatized. No major clarity breaks, but line-level tightness varies.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose exhibits pervasive template cadence and synonym loops: "recapture" appears six times, "noble lie/lies" five times, "emotionally rational" three times, often in parallel constructions ("Recapture was restoration," "This recapture was never about blame," "The final petal's fall…his work ensured it also marked a beginning"). Paragraph openings repeat stems: "He settled," "He spoke," "He turned," "He envisioned," "He secured," "He rose," "He knew," "He carried," "He disappeared." Figurative language is mixed (ivy "swallowed," "strangled," "veiled" in quick succession; "suffocating pit of lies" followed by "buried genuine grief"). Filter verbs cluster in reflective beats ("He envisioned Eleanor Gable," "He felt sorrow"). The lines are grammatically clean and the information density is acceptable, but the loops and scaffolding obscure momentum, particularly in the final third where the closure beats are buried under restatement. Apply −1.2 for pervasive template cadence and loops touching closure; disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.7)
    Serious overwriting pervades the piece: nearly every sentence carries figurative weight ("chains biting the dawn sky," "hushed blaze of purpose," "tapestry of witness"), creating density without propulsion. Template cadence is evident in repeated "His [noun] was [abstract]" constructions and "The [noun] [verb]" openers. Paraphrase loops cluster around key phrases—"interlaced absence" appears six times, "hushed blaze" four, "stoically sensitive" three—without evolving meaning. Mixed metaphors ("wrest coherence," "prying loose," "sutures," "embroidery," "seeds") pile tactical images incoherently. The final third intensifies these patterns rather than resolving them, disqualifying 9+ across all categories per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean with varied sentence structure and strong sensory specificity (leviathan bone, seagrass-and-coral watermark). Information density is high in the investigation beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She had not altered history; she had restored a silenced voice" / "no longer forgotten—it was remembered" restate the closure concept without added pressure. The phrase "dappled resolve" recurs in paragraph 2, 20, and 28 without reweighting; "tranquilly perceptive" appears in paragraphs 4, 10, and as "tranquilly perceptive observation" in 23, reading as template anchors. Stock metaphor: "quiet fire" (motivation) and "stones themselves seeming to exhale" (pathetic fallacy) in peak beats. Cumulative pattern artifacts total approximately −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and concision are generally solid with purposeful detail, but several passages carry overwriting: "impossible beauty," "woven from light and longing," "torment transmuted into tenderness" stack metaphor without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "It was not erased; it was shaped... It was not a tear of despair, but of acknowledgment." Minor paraphrase loop at "The grief would be folded again" versus prior folding description. No major artifacts touch closure, but density in high-pressure beats (dream-recording sequence) dilutes propulsion. Information density is adequate but not exceptional; these cumulative issues prevent entry to 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies across most beats, with vivid images (geode's rough exterior, Earth's wounded beauty, tears cutting clean paths). However, the final third accumulates paraphrase loops: "The unused potential was not a destination, but a lens" restates the prior realization without new pressure; "intangibly tangible" appears twice (para 11 and 33) as a phrase-stamp; and the closure run ("She pocketed… She descended… The observatory drifted…") uses template cadence (She [verb]… walking toward… ready to…). Figurative density is high ("silent ocean," "crater of the past," "canvas alive with echoes") but mostly coherent. Filter verbs ("she perceived," "she understood," "she looked") cluster in reflective beats without harming immediacy. The paraphrase and template issues in the final third trigger −0.6 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong, but the prose carries scattered overwriting: "brilliant dimness" recurs four times without evolving meaning, "perpetually surprised" is asserted in three near-identical phrases, and elevated metaphors cluster in the orrery activation ("harmonic frequency," "celestial tapestry"). The final paragraph loops thematic language ("brilliant dimness was no longer empty; it was filled with the quiet hum of belonging") that restates rather than advances. Template cadence appears in "He [verb]…" stems. No major causality obscuration, but density sags under decorative phrasing. Accumulated artifacts and loops warrant −0.6 to −0.9 in Q7; the −0.9 estimate places the score in the low-6 band.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.8)
    Rhythm is sonorous but often repetitive in structure: many paragraphs open with "He," "The," or "As," creating template cadence (-0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "weight of unspoken words" recurs without added pressure, and the closure restates earlier ideas ("no longer...but" constructions proliferate in the final third). Figurative language is dense ("dusk bled," "tiles drank," "stars as pinpricks") and occasionally strained ("sieved hush...crystallized"). Information density is moderate; several lines restate Elias's guilt and vow without advancing situation. These artifacts touch the closure third, triggering the 9+ disallowance and high-band cap at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and mostly clear, with vivid imagery ("wind whipping his coat like a tattered banner," "sliver of pearl against deep indigo"). However, several paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: the drawer pull is described multiple times in adjacent passages with slight rephrasing, and "furrowed hush" recurs in near-duplicate constructions. Template cadence is present in repeated "The [noun]..." sentence openers. Figurative density is high in exposition-heavy beats without always advancing pressure. Minor filter-verb stacks ("felt transformed," "felt like a threshold") dull immediacy in the closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short beats at the pole-counting, longer reflection during backstory, swift action at the turn). Information density is high in the opening and climax. Several prose artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops ("His mind…began to gravitate" / "his gaze…began to gravitate"), repeated label constructions ("merrily melancholic" appears twice, "backlash of regrets" three times), and stock metaphor strings ("diamond needle stitching night to day," "rosary beads"). Template cadence in the middle: "Pole three, four, five" then "He glanced…He glanced." Artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy in a high-pressure beat (Widow's Point). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "tiny altar to second chances" borders on overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clear with vivid images ("bioluminescent lake, its waters shimmering with soft, pulsing light") and varied sentence rhythm. Information density is high in the labyrinth sequence, where each clue advances both plot and theme. However, paraphrase loops appear: "He had navigated the labyrinth not to erase his past, but to transform its weight into wisdom" closely echoes the prior paragraph's "stopped fighting the memories...held these truths...with aching, compassionate understanding." The final third accumulates summary: "Every choice from this moment would be made with eyes open to the humanity he had once broken, and now vowed to mend" restates resolution rather than dramatizing a final micro-choice. Template cadence surfaces in the descent sequence: "Descending, the city's hum faded...At a three-way junction, he unrolled...Later, a rockfall blocked..." strings and-then moves without syntactic variety. The phrase "clean slate seeker" in the opening reads as label rather than lived detail, and "jaded wonder" is named rather than embodied in that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence in the metamorphosis sequence carries layered metaphor ("insistent unspooling," "reluctant metamorphosis beginning at the edges of her soul," "cosmic intimacy: to feel simultaneously infinitesimal beneath the cosmos and profoundly, intimately connected"), reducing clarity and momentum (−0.7 density/coherence). Template cadence is evident: repeated stems like "She felt," "The [noun] was [metaphor]," and "This was [concept]: [elaboration]" across multiple paragraphs (−0.5 template run). Paraphrase loops appear (paragraphs restating the transformation's nature without advancing situation: "not an ending, but a deepening" echoes "not pain, but an insistent unspooling"). Stock metaphors cluster: "hollow space beneath her ribs," "silver paths down her cheeks," "roots and starlight" (−0.4 stock strings). Register drift into elevated diction ("nascent constellations," "cosmic intimacy," "reluctant metamorphosis") clashes with the simplicity expected of a decades-long beast whisperer under emotional duress (−0.4). Cumulative artifact deduction and spread justify −1.5 total in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual breaks. Sentence openings show variety. Information density is high in places (the locket containing her mother's hand-tracing is efficient), but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and thematic restates. "Willingly perplexed" appears three times as identical label. "Choking beauty" recurs without evolution. The final third contains multiple synonym cycles: "lost time does not pool in vaults. It accumulates precisely in these fractures" is immediately restated as "These breaks are not voids but vessels" and again as "Time was not lost; it was woven into love's very texture." The closing paragraph summarizes the entire thematic arc ("in the willing perplexity of devotion, in repentance that releases despair...") rather than trusting the image. Template cadence appears in the vision sequence: "her mother's laughter...the sharp sound...Lyra's tiny hand..." Applying −0.8 for paraphrase loops and thematic restates across the final third, plus −0.3 for label repetition; total artifact penalty −1.1.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high, but several beats loop paraphrase: "she did not fight them. She breathed into the discomfort" closely echoes "welcoming each shadow with gentle acknowledgment." Template cadence appears in the middle section: "She recalled… A genuine smile bloomed… She rose an inch." Stock phrases cluster: "ghostly resolve," "infinite mercy," "sacred offering." Figurative density spikes without clear pattern payoff ("symphony of sorrow," "alchemy," "tapestry of her being") in a single high-pressure paragraph, triggering −0.5. No closure-level opacity, so artifact penalties remain capped per non-closure rules.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn throughout: "whispering hush" repeated four times, "vibrant hush" three times, "texture of transformation" echoed across multiple paragraphs. Template cadence in opening lines ("Today's path felt," "Her bare feet met," "The mountain exhaled") and stacked filter verbs in the release sequence ("she felt," "she knew," "she acted"). Mixed metaphors ("river of living light flowed...toward sky") and elevated diction ("breathless moment," "gentle unspooling") in peak beats dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but carries recurring patterns: "The air hummed," "the silence had transformed," "the revolution required." Template cadence in action sequences ("knelt… poised… adjusted… clicked") flattens propulsion. Figurative density is high throughout ("canvas," "cradle," "midwife," "spark") without pattern-teaching or crescendo at closure, reading more decorative than pressurizing. Several lines paraphrase adjacently (e.g., paragraphs on "silent revolution" restate the concept). Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty, but scaffold remains visible.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and several images are sharp ("liquid mercury," "stone gritted"), but overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "a physics mourned like a lost language, now returned" stacks metaphor without clarity, and "silent acknowledgment, participation" is redundant synonym pairing. Template cadence appears in the opening (four successive sentences beginning with noun-subject declaratives), and the final four paragraphs loop thematically without advancing pressure. Paraphrase drift: "The collapsed star dust was not merely destructive; wielded with reverence, it was a catalyst for renewal" tells what the prior beat already showed. Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching, and the closure paragraph's abstract summary ("hope—a future where children run without sliding") dilutes the prior tactile image of stone gritting. Line-level artifacts lower momentum in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.2)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "rarefied essence of courage" echoes "rarefying memory into luminous truth"; "vigil in pause" / "vigil resumed" / "conducting one" cycle without added detail. Template cadence runs: "She had climbed… to understand… to trace…" / "She was no longer… she was conducting…" Multiple filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("began to," "started to"). Mixed metaphors: "cartography of scars" as both map and constellation. These artifacts dull the closure image. Apply −1.2 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: metaphor density ("liquid gold," "symphony where logic composed the melody," "alchemy of waiting") appears in most sentences without variation or rest. Multiple paraphrase loops: "dignified chaos" recurs three times; "questions into destinations" is restated; the sundial's fractured/unified state is narrated, then summarized in the penultimate paragraph. Template cadence: "She was…," "The piece…," "Her…" sentence stems repeat. Register drifts into elevated abstractions ("transcendent understanding," "sacred nexus") that clash with the urgent present task. Information density is high but momentum suffers under decorative layering. Apply −1.2 for density + loops + register drift across multiple beats, including the closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "skeletal ribs," "psychic tremor," "persona of granite resolve," "alchemy," "crucible," "luminous fracture." At closure, stacked metaphors ("confluence of selves," "testament," "cultivates the deepest hope") compete without clear propulsion. Paraphrase loop appears: "beauty was forged not despite the anarchy" (line 290) restates the motivation from line 94. Template cadence visible in summary sentences ("The blooming resistance was this seed, this act, this rising sanctuary"). Some filter-verb stacks ("felt the familiar," "knew the rebuild would endure") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense throughout high-pressure beats: "tethered to," "monument to time's cruel punctuation," "veils between worlds grew thin," "heart-maps," "pulsed with the music's crescendo," "love resonates beyond time's tyranny." Multiple adjacent sentences in the arbor sequence rely on elevated metaphor without grounding action, creating opacity. Template cadence appears in the middle: "She landed... she saw... one compass... she followed... she would fulfill... placing the broken clock... she closed her eyes... she poured." Paraphrase loop: "flicker" and compass guidance are restated across three consecutive beats without added pressure. The final "different light had taken root" echoes the opening's "afternoon light bled through," but the return feels decorative rather than earned by a pattern taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.3)
    Phrasing artifacts cluster: "luminous doubt" appears four times, "empirically whimsical" twice, and synonym loops ("endure/enduring," "memory/cultural memory/collective memory") recur without added pressure. Template cadence: "She felt... She heard... She tasted... She recalled... She would document..." stacks in high-pressure beats. Mixed metaphor: "doubt threatened to swallow her whole" followed immediately by "luminous doubt shimmering like the blossoms." The final third summarizes future intentions rather than advancing present action, flattening momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence in the compass ritual deploys figurative language ("rhythmically placid tide," "cerulean light washed over guilt's jagged rocks"), creating density without propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent paragraphs (e.g., the severance is restated multiple times in the opening third; the compass lesson is recapped in both the vision and the final wrap). Template cadence runs through the middle third with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" and "He [verb]" stems, and synonym churn ("severance," "unraveling," "fractured conversation") obscures rather than clarifies the central loss. Filter verbs stack in the reflection passages ("he perceived," "he saw," "he looked"), dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, but a slight tendency toward explicit summary in the closure beats ("teaching humility to those who wait") prevents a 9+ score; otherwise, no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is often beautiful and dense, but shows overwriting in high-pressure reflective beats. Examples: "a drifting resonance filled the space—a palpable connection..." has some abstraction and near-synonym feel ("drifting resonance"/"palpable connection"). The sentence "She saw the collision clearly: her art of light dependent on the very charcoal that fueled shadowy trades..." uses a colon for declarative thematic statement, slightly disrupting the accumulated texture. Rhythm is generally strong, but these artifacts cluster near the climax.

    Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive with high information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, no loops or scaffolding. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating toward convergence. No artifacts that obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and poetic, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion. However, a minor hairline slip occurs in the peak beat: "The suppressed creativity surged forth, uncorked and unstoppable—a river of memory, purpose, and enduring connection flowing back into her veins" flirts with a therapy-speak label and a stacked metaphor that slightly softens the immediate tactile precision of the surrounding lines. This does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or figurative muddle. Lines advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, and closure image is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.4)

However, no artifacts obscure closure, and line-level propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished, with varied rhythm and high information density. No noticeable loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and purposeful. Minor risk of overwriting in places, but clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet precise, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms. Figurative language ("twilight bled into deep indigo," "resolve... fragile yet unyielding as spider silk") is purposeful and coherent, never muddying causality. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift. The final paragraph's cadence shift ("The dawn was not an ending...") propels closure without ornament. Read-aloud test passes with controlled momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and poetic with strong rhythmic control and high information density. Minor deduction for a tendency toward decorative phrasing ("pearl twilight," "celestial dance") that borders on overwriting in a few spots, but clarity and momentum are never lost, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with purposeful rhythm, though slightly overwritten in places ("reed-blown melancholy" appears twice, "tapestry of cold, watchful stars").

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and pattern-taught, e.g., “borrowed starlight” recurs to illuminate truth, and no artifacts obscure clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense, poetic, and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation. However, it flirts with overwriting: phrases like "scintillatingly somber" and "demure audacity" risk feeling ornamental, and there is occasional synonym churn (effort/labor). These are minor artifacts that do not obscure causality or the closure image but prevent a flawless score.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and artifact-free; figurative language ("radioactive tempest," "stillpoint of quiet resolve") serves pressure and clarity. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates the revelation and decelerates at the contemplative close.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyrical, dense prose with varied rhythm; figurative language is purposeful and consistent. No loops or scaffold; high information density advances story, as in "lightning flash-lit the churning cloud ocean." Meets the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is often lush and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, artifactual phrasing and mild overwriting create friction: "profound hush of lonesome splendor" is decorative; "sweetening the raw dawn chorus" is a slightly strained metaphor; adjacent paraphrase occurs ("sorrow and solace," "apology, a legacy, a key"). These patterns, while not catastrophic, dull the closure image's clarity and momentum, triggering a patterned-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Figurative language is consistent and purpose-driven, though a few phrases verge on precious ("fleshly in its vibration").

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures. Information density is high (e.g., the lantern description does multiple jobs). Minor artifacts: phrases like "fortified vulnerability" and "empathic imprints" edge toward therapy-speak/labeling, and there's slight conceptual redundancy in describing the memories ("not hallucinations, but empathetic imprints"). However, these do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. The final paragraph's cadence is particularly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and propelled, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("dust motes drifted like silent prayers") is consistent and voice-motivated. Peak beats remain clear.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and often carry dual loads of image and concept (e.g., “a sanctuary where decay was a method of grace”). The prose occasionally edges toward repetition and abstraction, especially in the repeated framing of “gradual change,” “decay,” and “meaning,” and some late lines paraphrase prior insights. There is a touch of purple in piling conceptual phrases in the closing stretch, which slightly blurs impact. Nonetheless, rhythm, clarity, and information density mostly hold, and no major artifacts undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, rhythmically varied, and densely informative, with many lines doing double duty for setting and theme. The figurative language (e.g., “frost etched across the ledge like a frozen scripture,” “drifting resonance”) is generally apt, though abstract nouns and repeated phrases (“drifting resonance,” “purpose,” “clarity”) accrue to slight purple-ness. There are minor redundancy/echo issues, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closing image. A light tightening of thematic abstractions and repeated conceptual terms would move this into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished, with varied sentence rhythms and dense but readable imagery (“Grief bloomed as deep indigo swirls; anxiety flared in jagged crimson”). Most lines do multiple jobs—advancing mood, world, and emotional state together—without clumsy scaffolding or loops. However, there is some purple, slightly redundant emphasis (“unshaken marvel,” “silence was not void but canvas,” followed by explicit thematic statement) that could be tightened. These issues don’t obscure clarity but keep the line-level work from feeling utterly taut.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied in rhythm, and densely informative, with most lines doing dual work for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and unmuddled; there’s little to no scaffold, synonym churn, or redundant paraphrasing. Pivotal images (the shard’s gold pulse, the mosaic beacon, turning off his lamp amid the residual glow) land cleanly. A few lines edge toward explanatory (“He had not repaired the lens; he had repurposed its brokenness…”) rather than fully trusting the images, which keeps it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and largely efficient; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character (e.g., the bell’s “clapper silenced by faded ribbon—a relic of joy deemed too dangerous to sound”). Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep momentum in a quiet piece, and there are no major clarity issues or artifacts. That said, certain phrases and ideas are reiterated in slightly paraphrased form (“amplified quiet,” “gently persistent,” and the statement about trust as the “true donation”), which introduces minor redundancy. A touch more cutting of explicit thematic restatements would sharpen the already strong line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences are clear, musical, and information-dense, often accomplishing atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Imagery is rich but mostly coherent, with recurring motifs (sparks, breath, inversion, blooming) rather than scattershot metaphor. There is some risk of purple prose and conceptual repetition in the closing third, where insights are paraphrased and named instead of left in image form, which slightly dulls momentum. Still, there are no major scaffolding artifacts or syntactic monotony, and closure remains textually sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, strong verbs, and a high density of meaningful images; lines generally do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme). The description of the fragment’s “luminous threads…tracing geodesics that diverged into infinity” exemplifies effective, concept-specific figurative language. There is some tendency toward piling abstractions and near-synonymous sentiments in the ending paragraphs (e.g., “peace settling,” “homecoming,” “dancing with time”) that could be tightened for maximal impact. Still, readability and momentum are maintained, and there are no major loops or muddled metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, image-rich, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and function (e.g., the bulldozer shadow as sundial both deepens mood and tracks time). Key objects and actions are described clearly, and momentum is preserved despite the lyricism. There is some repetition of constructions like "quiet," "sacred," and "staggering grace," and a few lines verge on purple or summarizing the theme, especially near the end. These are minor enough that they don’t seriously cloud clarity or dull the closure image but do keep it just shy of elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, interiority, theme) with rhythm that suits the lyrical mode and few redundancies or scaffolding artifacts. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise, with images of absences and marine decay cohering into a clear symbolic field. There is mild overwriting and some conceptual repetition around silence/absence and explicit thematic phrasing, which slightly softens the sharpness of the closing beats. Nonetheless, clarity, momentum, and music remain high, and no figurative muddle impairs the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished and musical, with strong sensory specificity and recurring motifs that carry thematic weight. However, figurative language around light and destiny is quite dense, and some phrases feel like paraphrase or slogan (“not a portrait, but a promise”; “press her ear against destiny’s door”) rather than fresh image, softening impact. A few beats reiterate the same idea in slightly different wording, adding a touch of redundancy. Overall momentum holds, but the line-level occasionally veers toward purple, keeping this below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and images that often do double duty (e.g., the “liquid metronome” of the thaw). Prose supports momentum, with most sentences advancing atmosphere and emotional stakes rather than scaffolding. Some figurative language (“weighty lightness,” reiterated thaw metaphors, explicit restatement of already-implied ideas) borders on purple or redundant, suggesting opportunities for tightening. These do not significantly obscure clarity or closure but do keep the piece a notch below the absolute sharpest line work.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level writing is generally clean, concise, and purposeful, with several strong images (“rust tears,” “skeletal ruin of forgotten knowledge”) and good information density. Nonetheless, there are moments of abstraction and purple tilt (“transformative betrayal,” “cradle of resilience,” “authentically whole”) that read more like thematic labels than lived experience. The closing paragraphs, in particular, paraphrase the story’s meaning rather than trusting accumulated images to carry it. These issues don’t break clarity or momentum, but they do blunt the prose’s edge at the most important beat.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, often doing multiple jobs—building world, theme, and mood at once—and most metaphors are coherent and on-concept. There is some overwriting and repetition (numerous rephrasings of hush/silence and similar textural descriptions) that could be trimmed without loss, which slightly drags momentum in a short piece. Still, syntax is clean, sequencing is clear, and the final image lands vividly. Line-level craft is strong enough for serious consideration, though not yet polished to the spareness expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and fluid, with good information density and a pleasing mix of concrete and abstract phrasing. Some phrases are striking (“dissolved like melting glass,” “mundane mysticism”), and syntax varies enough to avoid monotony. However, the prose occasionally tips toward over-explication and conceptual repetition in the closing passages, where ideas are restated instead of allowed to resonate purely through image. The language remains clear throughout, but trimming a few explanatory lines would tighten momentum and sharpen the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent (“whispering forecourt,” “emotional landscapes”), but mostly coherent and purposeful rather than showy. There are mild instances of abstraction or redundancy in the closing moral sentences, yet they do not significantly obscure sense or momentum. Overall, the prose feels polished and publication-ready, if slightly lush.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and economical for its lyric density; most sentences do at least two jobs (image, character, and theme) without obvious scaffolding. Recurrent motifs like “blooming” and “withering” and the sensory diction around soil, cloth, and glass feel deliberate rather than purple. The main limits are a few explanatory sentences that paraphrase the symbolism (“The mended deception was clear…”) and minor redundancy in restating the theme near the end, which slightly blunts impact. The bracketed numeric artifacts interrupt the flow but can be cleanly excised without structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is often striking and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and there is a strong ear for image (e.g., “settled like frost on glass”). However, the density of figurative language is high, and certain phrases repeat (“mechanically warm hands,” “hush of beating wings,” “time…breathed sideways”) to the edge of self-conscious motif. A few lines veer close to purple or pseudo-profound (“a universe infinitely kinder than he’d dreamed”) and could be sharpened or pruned. Overall clarity and momentum survive intact, but some tightening would elevate it to top-tier literary polish.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, sensory, and doing multiple jobs (advancing mood, stakes, and character simultaneously). Repetition of key phrases (“in between spaces,” “wordless conversation,” “hush”) functions as motif rather than mere loop, and there’s little genuine scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, avoiding mixed or strained metaphors. A few lines verge on purple or expository (“His motivation burned clear”), which slightly dulls the otherwise excellent texture.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most carry multiple loads (setting, character, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Metaphors—stone of guilt, auroral sorrow, margins—are coherent and sustained, and although the prose is dense, it remains largely clear and purposeful. A few lines edge toward purple or abstract (“a light born of collision,” “peripherally aware of grace”) but they do not significantly obscure action or closure. There are no noticeable grammatical slips or structural artifacts that drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level work is generally strong: varied syntax, good information density, and effective sensory choices that advance both mood and character. Some phrases and concepts recur in slightly paraphrased form (“swallowed truth,” “weight,” “ghost shift” vs. “truth shift”), and there are occasional adjective-stacked sentences that verge on purple without adding new pressure. The explanatory paragraph about the foreman and pact leans more toward telling than the rest, softening momentum. Still, clarity never falters and the final images (“soft click of bead against iron,” “faint, grey promise of dawn”) are clean and affecting.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, syntactically varied, and often do double duty, advancing both image and theme (“moss to stitch broken flagstones with emerald thread,” “each fracture was not decay but dialogue”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, creating a unified aesthetic rather than scattered metaphors; there’s little genuine scaffolding or paraphrase looping. At times the density of modifiers and abstractions (“regenerative silence,” “crumbling peace,” “metamorphosis”) edges toward purple, especially given the low-tension stakes, which can slightly slow momentum. Nonetheless, clarity remains high and the final images land crisply.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally smooth and readable, with pleasing sensory density and a coherent rhythmic flow that suits the contemplative mood. Many sentences do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and emotional state, and there are few outright clunky constructions. However, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases and concepts (“ordinary magic,” “softly adaptive,” “hush of dreaming roots”), and a tendency toward purple, abstracted diction near the end where a sharper, more concrete image might hit harder. The prose remains clear, but occasional overstatement and conceptual language slightly dull momentum and undercut the climax’s delicacy.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is strong, with high information density and evocative images that often do double duty (e.g., “brittle maps of sorrow,” “a fragment…showing dragons coiled around a fractured crown”). Line-level clarity remains intact despite the lyrical mode; cause/effect and image logic are never obscured. There is some repetition of phrasing and motif (“bronze quiet,” “silence,” “stories”) that risks slight over-insistence but mostly feels patterned rather than accidental. Figurative language is frequent yet disciplined, with no significant mixed metaphors or scaffold sentences dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally precise and musical, with high information density—many sentences simultaneously advance setting, character, and theme. Imagery such as “granite teeth,” “rose-gold light bled the horizon,” and the final “steady rhythm of two hearts learning a new melody” feels controlled rather than gratuitous. There is some repetition and mild purple or didactic phrasing in the thematic wrap-up, but it doesn’t significantly obscure clarity or momentum. Line-level craft is solidly publication-ready, if not utterly spare.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: high information density, clean syntax, and recurring images (silence, color, threads) doing real work. There is a consistent tendency toward lush, figurative language—“chapel woven from solidified silence,” “possession was a cold vine”—that mostly lands but edges into purple at times and risks saturation. A few lines paraphrase thematic points already made, and some metaphors (“decorated the sanctuary not with icons, but with intentional silence”) are reiterated in slightly varied form. Despite this, clarity and momentum are preserved, and the closure image reads crisply.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are clean, vivid, and information-dense, with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language (e.g., “fossilized map of time,” “upturned hush”) is apt and generally unstacked, avoiding mixed metaphors even in peak beats. The prose sustains momentum despite its lyricism, and the final third in particular is sharply cut, landing on a precise, charged cadence. There is mild risk of saturation—nearly every line is doing something poetic—but it doesn’t tip into muddle or slow the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntax varied, and most lines carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion plus theme). The opening and closing paragraphs are especially polished, with precise, evocative images like “each puddle a captured fragment of dying light” and the “calm, concentric wave healing fractures in time and self.” There is some purple density and abstraction—“labyrinth of self,” “integrated strength,” “procedural generation reshaped the labyrinth”—that begin to feel repetitive and slightly expository, especially near the end. These tendencies don’t break clarity, but they do dull some peaks that might hit harder with more concrete, specific phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong image economies like the broken needle as “a shard of her own grief” and numbness “like frost over her spirit.” Sentences generally do multi-duty—advancing setting, theme, and emotion—without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, and key beats (the drum’s impact, the memory flood) remain clear and grounded. A very slight tendency toward stacked metaphors in reflective lines keeps it just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with purposeful imagery, with few wasted sentences and generally clear syntax. Sensory detail, especially around weather and physical space, is strong and often multi-functional. There is some tendency toward conceptual/abstract phrasing and repetition (“nurtured integrity in solitude” appears twice; “progress laterally” is labeled and then reiterated) that edges into slight over-articulation. Trimming a few explicit labels in favor of image or action would heighten impact at this level of venues.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: vivid metaphors, efficient syntax, and high information density with most sentences doing double duty. Images like tears scattering “tiny, crystalline shadows” are both fresh and precise. There is some repetition and mild purple-prose accumulation, especially in the final third where abstractions and thematic statements slightly dull the impact. Tightening those late explanatory lines would lift the piece into a more rarefied band.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and lines that typically carry multiple jobs (setting, emotion, and theme in one). Sensory specificity (“a single tear traced dust on his cheek,” “starlight pooled like liquid silver”) gives the piece strong read-aloud cadence. There is some tendency toward stacked metaphors and explicit abstractions in the closing stretch, which verge on purple and slightly blunt the delicacy of earlier images. Still, momentum and clarity are maintained, and there’s little true scaffolding or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, theme) and maintain good rhythm, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. The prose is lush but mostly disciplined, with metaphors echoing core motifs (ash, silence, resonance) rather than scattering. That said, the density of figurative language occasionally edges toward purple, and some abstract formulations (“beauty found in fragile, ongoing creation”) are less sharp than the best concrete images. These are refinements rather than structural problems, but they keep the piece out of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and efficient, with vivid images like “amber grotto,” “captured sunset,” and “rain on cobblestones” doing layered work for atmosphere and emotion. Sentence rhythm varies, and most lines advance multiple levels (world, character, theme) without obvious scaffolding. There is some conceptual repetition and a few abstract, essay-like phrases in the final third that marginally reduce sharpness. Overall line-level craft is publication-ready but not entirely free of mild overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with some lovely lines and images. A few phrases verge on purple or abstract (“logistics of the soul,” “cautious exuberance bloom”), but clarity remains intact. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and sentences generally do double duty for character, setting, and theme. The density of figurative language is high, yet not so stacked as to blur sense or obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant and economical, packing worldbuilding, mood, and character into dense sentences that carry multiple functions. Imagery is often strong and coherent (“liquid starlight,” “star-flecked shadow”), and there is little scaffolding or redundancy. At times the language veers toward purple, with stacked metaphors and abstractions (“luminescent ache,” “harmonious chord,” “guardian of fading light”) that risk sentimentality. Still, clarity and momentum are preserved, and line-level craft is above average for competitive markets.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, dense, and purposeful, with vivid metaphors (“lattice of solidified soundwaves,” “unraveling like thread from a spindle”) that support the conceit. There is some risk of purple prose and conceptual redundancy in stacked abstractions (time, echoes, soul, resonance) but it rarely muddies sense or momentum. The rhythm through the climax remains propulsive despite lyricism, and there are no major loops or scaffold phrases. Minor trimming of overtly grand phrases could push this closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, imagery is largely coherent, and most lines carry multiple burdens of setting, emotion, and theme without bloat. There is some density of figurative language, but it’s mostly purposeful and pattern-consistent rather than purple for its own sake. A few adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas about transformation and connection in the closing stretch, creating a slight sense of redundancy and softening the impact of the final images. Tightening those repetitions would sharpen momentum and let the strongest lines ring longer.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty with setting and emotion. A few phrases veer toward the purple or slightly familiar (“minutes stretched like taffy,” repeated “sapphire hush”/illumination metaphors), but they do not obscure sense or closure. There is little visible scaffold or synonym churn, and action ordering remains clean throughout. Slight trimming of descriptive redundancies and a touch less adornment in peak beats would lift this further.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density and images that often do double thematic and sensory duty (e.g., the leaf’s veins as “a journey of surrender”). Sentence-level rhythm flows smoothly, and there are few, if any, outright clunky lines. That said, figurative language is frequent and sometimes leans toward purple or explanatory (“metamorphosis within her,” “method for true reconstruction”), nudging into telling where an image might suffice. The lushness is controlled enough not to impede clarity or momentum, but some trimming could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most images work double duty for setting and emotion (“sea glass gleaming like forgotten tears,” “bright as shattered glass”). The prose edges toward lush, but figurative language is generally coherent and not so stacked as to blur sense or momentum. There is little scaffolding or repetition; almost every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. A slight tendency toward repeated formulations (“wryly earnest,” explicit thematic aphorisms) keeps this shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with rich imagery and a good sense of cadence; most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). There is some density/overwriting—stacked modifiers and repeated abstractions (“unseen forces,” “bright darkness,” “tapestry”) that could be trimmed without loss. A few sentences paraphrase already-implied ideas, particularly in the closing reflection, which modestly blunts impact. Nonetheless, clarity is never in doubt, and the rhythm of the closing paragraphs lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, with high information density and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned (salt, rain, stone, sound, fragments), avoiding mixed metaphors. The prose largely balances lyricism with clarity; even complex images like “reactively visionary…mapping the contours of what was lost” remain intelligible. While a few descriptors verge on lush, they do not noticeably drag momentum or obscure cause and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is fluent, image-dense, and generally precise, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., the vellum life-map annotated with “inked regrets and watercolor joys”). Sentence rhythm varies and reads smoothly aloud, and there are no major clarity issues or mechanical errors. That said, figurative language is nearly constant, veering toward purple in places and occasionally restating similar ideas with different ornamentation, which slightly dulls momentum. A modest tightening of modifiers and thematic restatements would elevate this to elite line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and image-rich, with high information density—sentences often do double duty for setting, mood, and character. Metaphors (symphony, tapestry, song) are cohesive rather than muddled, and the line-level rhythm supports the gentle escalation toward revelation. There is mild risk of purple repetition around “symphony/song” and “sculpted space,” but it doesn’t materially slow momentum or cloud meaning. Overall, the craft is strong and polished, if a touch thematically on-the-nose at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization (“Ten thousand years of solitude had polished his boredom to a flawless, suffocating sheen”). Figurative language is generally coherent and thematically aligned, and there’s little outright scaffolding or repetition that stalls momentum. That said, the density of metaphors and modifiers is high enough that some lines feel ornamental rather than necessary, softening impact in pivotal moments. Trimming a few abstractions and intensifiers would sharpen pressure without losing the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: most lines do double duty, advancing mood and character while maintaining clarity and momentum. Figurative language is generally apt and not overstacked, with only occasional abstract formulations that approach thematic exposition. There’s little scaffolding or synonym-churn; repetition (e.g., “mathematics of a fair trade,” “deathly vitality”) feels patterned rather than accidental. A slight tendency toward conceptual phrasing in mid-story reflection keeps this from reaching the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: high information density, few wasted sentences, and metaphors that stay coherent with the story’s motifs (light, hum, texture, refracted perception). There is a consistent lyric richness, but it stops short of full purple prose; most images earn their place. A few lines lean toward explicit abstraction or repetition of concepts already implied (“incandescent restraint,” thesis-like sentences about her work), which slightly softens impact. Rhythm and clarity hold through the ending, keeping the closure image clean.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are varied, dense with information, and multi-functional, advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously. A few lines flirt with purple or explanatory phrasing (e.g., explicitly naming “the core of erased histories”) and the figurative load is consistently high, but it remains coherent and controlled. There’s little to no scaffolding, synonym churn, or obvious loops; most sentences earn their place. The final movement’s prose stays clear and charged, preserving closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, musical, and information-dense, with minimal scaffolding or repetition, and images like “salt-tinged breath of the churning sea” and “gloomy cheerfulness” feel fresh. Figurative language is present but not so overstacked that it muddies clarity, and the action sequence (bow across strings → hum → memory) is easy to follow. The final paragraphs tilt toward abstraction and paraphrase thematic conclusions already implied, which slightly blunts momentum and subtlety. Still, there are no serious artifacts or syntactic monotony, and the closure image lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line by line, the prose is fluent, mostly economical, and rhythmically varied; sentences often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and plot) without obvious scaffolding. A handful of moments flirt with purple or conceptual redundancy (“vibrant, anarchic soul,” “language of vibrant resistance,” “profound comfort”), but they do not materially obscure sense or closure. There are no major loops, syntactic glitches, or mixed metaphors that impede momentum. Tightening a few abstract formulations into more embodied images would raise it to a more rarefied tier.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythms, clean syntax, and many striking images (the crater as a “bowl-shaped scar,” dawn setting “billion-year-old rock layers ablaze”). Information density is high and most lines do more than one job, particularly in the central vigil passage. However, there is some over-writing and repetition—the “he had outlasted” triad, clusters of abstract nouns (“vigil,” “melancholy,” “presence,” “testament,” “elegy”) and adjectives—that could be tightened for a top-tier venue. These purple touches don’t obscure meaning or closure, but they slightly slow momentum and could be pared for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with evocative images like “liquid rainbows” and “iron bones softened by a perpetual pearl-gray haze.” Yet there is a noticeable accumulation of abstract intensifiers and near-redundant formulations (“magnetic calm,” “sacred duty,” “perfect clarity,” “unwavering purpose”) that edge into purple prose and minor paraphrase loops, especially in the closing thematic exposition. These choices do not obscure causality, but they slightly blunt momentum and subtlety. Tightening a few over-written lines would push this toward top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with most sentences doing at least two jobs (world-building plus character, theme plus atmosphere) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; motifs like ice, condensation, convergence, and atlas marginalia recur in deliberate, coherent ways rather than as purple clutter. There are a few abstraction-heavy lines, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure image—the final paragraphs remain clear and resonant. Line-level craft is very strong and near-ready for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: many sentences do double duty, advancing atmosphere and action, and the repetition patterns (tap/steps, hush) feel designed rather than accidental. There is some density of figurative language and stacked modifiers (“silence thick with the weight of forgotten footsteps and impending loss”) that could be pared for even more impact. Momentum holds because each descriptive flourish is tied to emergent change in the town, with minimal outright scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The closure image is clear and uncluttered, indicating solid control despite occasional lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid metaphors (“woven tapestry of stillness,” “liquid gold light”) and good rhythmic variation that supports mood and momentum. However, figurative density is high throughout, and certain lines feel redundant or slightly purple, restating the same emotional note (e.g., multiple invocations of the hush and solitude’s splendor) without new pressure. There are no major clarity issues or structural artifacts, but a demanding line edit could trim repetition and sharpen impact. The closing paragraphs maintain clarity and cadence, preserving the power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is often strong: many sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, and theme) and the rhythm of long, sinuous lines interspersed with short emphatic ones supports the meditative tone. Images like “the moth… wings catching copperlight like whispered prayers” and “a tear cut through the grime on his cheek, gleaming copper-bright” are vivid and apt. However, repeated formulations and explicit thematic clarifications (“He had chased the hush not to escape noise, but to find the silence where understanding begins”) verge on purple and slightly dilute momentum. A modest tightening of redundancies and trust in the images over expository restatement would lift this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished, generally clear, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for mood and plot (“A wave of light cascaded through the greenhouse, awakening every plant in a symphony of color, scent, and resonant song”). However, figurative language and modifiers are heavily stacked across the piece, pushing toward purple in places and slightly dulling impact via over-saturation. There are minor redundancy and echo issues (“lovingly venomous,” “mournful elation,” multiple “resonant” uses). Line-level craft is strong but would benefit from selective pruning for a truly elite finish.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, atmosphere, and emotional shading at once. The prose leans lush, with abundant modifiers and figurative language, yet generally avoids mixed metaphors or outright muddle, and action remains legible. There are minor redundancies and slightly overworked phrasing (“hauntingly optimistic,” “orchid solace,” repeated invocations of reverence/ruin) that could be trimmed for greater sharpness in a top-tier venue. Overall momentum is more contemplative than propulsive, but the syntax and imagery are controlled enough to keep it from feeling bogged down.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are dense, multi-functional, and image-rich, with minimal redundancy and clean grammar. Metaphors are coherent and grounded in the story’s material vocabulary (roots, shadows, breath) rather than reaching for flashy surprise. There is some conceptual repetition (“interrupted journeys,” “rebuild”) and a few lines that tilt toward didactic abstraction, slightly blunting momentum at the close. Overall, though, rhythm and clarity hold, and the climactic alignment image remains vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is largely clean, fluid, and image-dense; many sentences multitask by advancing setting, character, and theme simultaneously. Rhythm varies enough to read smoothly, and the final images (letter traveling, chalk dust on shoes) land with clarity. That said, there is a mild tendency toward abstraction and stacked modifiers (“carefully inventive,” “profound juxtaposition,” “perfect alignment,” “futuristic nostalgia”) that sometimes label the effect instead of letting the concrete particulars carry it. This leans a hair purple at points but never enough to obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is polished, with rhythmic variation and strong information density—most sentences advance setting, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language (threads, embers, starlight) is recurrent but mostly coherent and pattern-consistent rather than muddled. There is some mild repetition (“echoed silence” twice, several “she [verb]” lead-ins) and occasional purple edges, yet clarity and momentum remain intact and the final images land cleanly. No major scaffolding, loops, or grammatical distractions interfere with closure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong sensory detail and metaphor (“bruised twilight,” “noose of pride and fear”) and generally good momentum. There is some drift toward purple and thematic repetition (“transcends,” “healing,” “love”) and a slightly over-packed final stretch that explains what the images already show. Nonetheless, clarity remains high and sentence-level rhythm largely supports the emotional arc. Trimming a few abstract or summative lines would elevate already good line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for character and mood. The piece largely avoids scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and the progression of images is clear. However, figurative language is nearly continuous (“lotus-hearted ache,” “rope braided not for escape, but for connection,” “sanctuary woven from breath and twilight”), pushing toward purple and risking saturation. A touch more restraint and a few sharper, plainer lines in peak beats would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong imagery (“magic in a darkroom tray,” “tactile whisper from a silenced era”) and good information density. There is some repetition of key terms (joy, luminous, memory, fog) and a few sentences that explain what the images already show, creating a faint sense of over-articulation. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme rather than muddled. Tightening a few redundant or abstract lines would sharpen momentum without sacrificing music.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: high information density, vivid images, and multi-function sentences that carry setting, theme, and character simultaneously. Rhythm varies enough to avoid mechanical cadence, and the magical mechanics of sound and light are described clearly despite their complexity. There is some ornamentation and conceptual repetition (“pause between inquiry and insight,” “fertile pause”) that veers toward purple and slightly dulls momentum. Still, line-level artifacts do not obscure cause-and-effect or closure, and most figurative language is controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: images are vivid, sentences vary in length, and most lines do double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Phrases like “cartographer of hope” and “cathedral where converging chaos was…architecture of liberation” are striking and conceptually coherent. There is some repetition of key abstractions (“spark of defiance,” “warp”) and a high density of metaphor that occasionally veers into purple territory without adding new pressure. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved, and no major scaffolding or loops drag the piece down.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level writing is lush but generally precise, with images doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphor density is high, yet the vehicles remain coherent and tonally aligned, avoiding major purple-prose muddle. The only constraint on an even higher score is that the near-uniform ornateness occasionally risks flattening contrast; a touch more spareness at pressure peaks might sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically aware, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and world-building. Nonetheless, there is a tendency toward purple phrasing and repetition (“gently systematic,” “foxglove regret,” stacked modifiers) that doesn’t always add new information or pressure. Some sentences could be tightened without any loss of meaning, and the final paragraph in particular veers into abstract, summary-like assertions. Line-level craft is strong, but the occasional overwriting and conceptual redundancy would face cuts at a top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished, grammatically clean, and often musical, with strong imagery like “silver particles…swirled like captured starlight.” Information density is high; most sentences do double duty advancing action and atmosphere. However, there is some repetition of favored terms and images (“luminous,” “glow,” “symphony”) that edges toward purple and slightly blunts the impact of key moments. Trimming a few decorative phrases would sharpen momentum without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density—many lines do double duty for setting, character, and theme. Recurring images (breath, brass, stone, light) are mostly well-handled, and grammar and sequencing are clean. However, there is a tendency toward purple phrasing and repetition (“encrypted compassion,” “slyly heartfelt,” multiple “breath” metaphors) that occasionally feels ornamental rather than necessary. These choices don’t obscure meaning, but they do slightly blunt momentum and risk preciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, image-dense, and generally high in information-per-line, with recurring motifs (dust, bloom/withering, echoes) doing multiple jobs at once. Syntax varies enough to avoid mechanical rhythm, and causality remains clear despite the lyric mode. There is a mild tendency toward over-saturation in figurative language and thematic vocabulary, particularly in the final third, which slightly risks purple tonal monotony. Still, there are no real scaffolding loops or muddled metaphors; line-level craft supports rather than obscures the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often beautiful and image-dense, with strong sensory specificity (crystalline facets, grain whorls, prism-lit logbook) and generally smooth rhythm. At the same time, there’s a tendency toward conceptual repetition and explicit paraphrasing of the theme, especially in the back half, which slightly dulls momentum and surprise. Some phrases verge on purple or mechanically echo prior lines (fractured hush, necessary distances) without always adding new nuance. Line-level craft is solidly above average but would benefit from a few strategic cuts and more trust in implication.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is rhythmically varied, image-dense, and generally precise; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once). Motifs and phrases recur with clear intent, giving the piece a musical cohesion rather than accidental looping. That said, there are moments of near-purple layering (“shadowseam wonder,” “luminous respite,” “softly ingenious”) where abstraction piles up and slightly blurs immediacy. The line-level craft is strong enough for serious consideration, but would likely need a subtle tightening pass for an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are mostly clean, information-dense, and purposeful, and the story moves without noticeable scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language—“dew on a web,” “seeds of memory traveling to nourish tomorrow”—is coherent and thematically aligned. There is some repetition of key phrases and a mild tendency toward abstract summation in the last paragraphs, but it doesn’t obscure sense or dull the closure image. Overall, the prose would be competitive in many top venues with only light tightening at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    The line-level craft is strong, with striking images (“star-dusted wilderness of sky,” “moonlight pooling in specific hollows”) and generally good syntactic variety that sustains a measured, atmospheric pace. However, figurative density is high throughout—many sentences stack modifiers and abstractions—which edges into purple and occasionally feels redundant (e.g., multiple restatements of orchestrated serendipity and purpose). Some lines explicitly explain what the images already convey, which slightly blunts momentum and sharpness. A tighter, more selectively lush revision would likely be required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (image, world, emotion), and syntax is generally clear and varied. However, figurative density is high throughout—multiple metaphors per paragraph, repeated cosmic diction—which edges into mild purple prose and can soften impact. There are a few near-redundant intensifiers (“cosmic verse,” “luminous map of courage,” “guiding light”) that could be tightened for greater punch. Despite this, momentum holds and the closure image is not obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: varied syntax, rich imagery, and a good sense of cadence, especially in the early paragraphs. Many sentences do double duty—advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously. That said, figurative and abstract language is very dense, and certain ideas are reiterated in different phrasings (“to make the invisible visible,” “to read between the lines,” “illuminate value in the mundane”), edging into mild redundancy and purple prose. The closure image remains clear, but some tightening would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting and emotion. Images generally cohere—porcelain cracks, scars, celestial motion, and fire echo without obvious contradiction. There is some redundancy and explanatory scaffolding, especially around restating the thematic thesis, and the figurative density occasionally approaches purple. Still, clarity is maintained, closure lands crisply, and there are no serious loops or mechanical flaws that impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and image-rich, with strong information density—most sentences serve both atmosphere and concept. Metaphor frequency is high but generally coherent and thematically linked (balloons, tides, spirals, equations) rather than random ornament. There are a few near-redundant phrasing moves (“quiet revolution of spirit,” “serene upheaval”) and slightly purple touches, yet they don’t obscure sense or momentum. Overall, the craft is publishable-level lyrical, just shy of the most austere, cut-to-the-bone control.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images and a good sense of rhythm, and most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding + emotion + theme). Still, there is noticeable redundancy and near-phrasing loops around key concepts (legacy, burden, dreams of walls), and a tendency toward abstract nouns and solemn modifiers that border on overwrought. Lines like “heart heavier yet clearer” and repeated constructions weaken impact via familiarity. Momentum never collapses, but tighter pruning would sharpen the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong and musical, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and action. However, figurative density is high—“liquid rainbows,” “liquid hope,” “thread of silver,” “gentle inevitability of sunset”—bordering on purple in places and risking sameness in tone. A few abstractions (“profound peace,” “essence of his offering”) lapse into telling and slightly blunt immediacy. Line-level control remains solid and clear, but some tightening and pruning of metaphors would benefit a prestige-market submission.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and high-density: most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) and maintain momentum. Imagery like "boots whispered," "sigils blooming like dark flowers," and "path…not paved with ash" is vivid without incoherence or mixed metaphors. There is minor repetition of conceptual phrases (ritual significance, flawed peace) and a touch of slogan-like abstraction, but it doesn’t materially dull the closure. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and there are no major scaffold or loop artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished: strong verbs, concrete images, and metaphorical consistency around steel, cracks, maps, and song. Most sentences do double duty (worldbuilding plus psychology, image plus theme) with little visible scaffold or redundancy. A few lines edge toward purple or abstract (“a cartography of loss,” “masterpiece of cold logic”) but remain legible and character-appropriate, not bogging momentum. The final cadence is especially well managed, landing on a precise, quiet image rather than an over-explained moral.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is rich, rhythmic, and generally precise; most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and action) without losing clarity. Metaphors are frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, and the ritual’s mechanics remain understandable despite the lyric density. There is some flirtation with purple prose and adornment—several similes and abstractions could be trimmed without loss—which slightly blunts momentum. Still, there are no serious loops or muddles, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, rich but mostly precise diction, and images that tend to pull multiple weights (e.g., the radar dome as both physical space and ethical metaphor). Information density is high and there’s little true scaffolding or dead weight. That said, there is some repetition and purple-text risk—phrases like “meteor hush,” “uncommon serenity,” and generalized statements about ethics and restoration recur enough to flirt with overwriting. These don’t break clarity but do slightly blunt momentum and nuance in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are generally precise, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. Key beats (producing the splint, the monarch’s testing of its wings, the ascent and disappearance) are rendered clearly and without scaffolding. There is some repetition of favored phrases and motifs (“blushing stillness,” “transiently rooted,” knots and threads) that edges toward purple but stops short of muddling sense or dragging pace. Overall density is high but well-managed, with only minimal sense of over-ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally elegant and efficient: most sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, character) and read smoothly aloud. The metaphoric system is coherent—casting, light, ice, and sound all interrelate—and there are no major clarity issues or logical slips. That said, the prose occasionally drifts toward overwriting and repetition (the repeated “technically gentle” and “snowmelt ardor,” stacked modifiers like “silent, swirling aurora”), which slightly blunts momentum. Tightening a few redundant or lush lines would move this closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong sensory images (“path of luminous sand,” “rain now lashed the roof, a frantic drumbeat”) and generally efficient sentence-level momentum. There is some overreliance on abstract or stock-lyric formulations (“sacred circuit of meaning,” “ethereal peace layered over the gritty reality of the storm”) and a pattern of similar sentence rhythms that can feel slightly purple. Still, clarity remains high and most sentences pull multiple weights (setting, mood, theme) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Tighter trimming of the most generalized spiritual language would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences have musical rhythm, information density is high, and most lines do at least two jobs (image, theme, character). However, there is noticeable repetition of motifs and formulations (“dusky harmony,” “encrypted devotion,” “covenant,” “alignment”) and stretches where adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea in slightly different language, which flattens momentum. The prose leans toward abstraction and nominalized phrases (“empirically ironic truth,” “architecture of connection”) that occasionally blur immediacy. Still, clarity is maintained, and the strongest images (lamp oil, glowing schematics, warm tile) land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images and efficient compression; many sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme). There is some tendency toward repetition and abstraction (“resentment,” “release,” “cellular memory,” “grace”) and a few lines verge on purple or expository (“Her pacifism was strategic compassion; her schemes cultivated peace where conflict once festered”). Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to sustain momentum, and the closure image is clear despite the lyric density. Tightening a handful of declarative, thematic sentences would sharpen the piece for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally elegant and precise, with strong imagery (“branches etched like veins against pearly fog,” “breath on glass”) and good rhythmic variation. However, figurative language is very dense—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or elevated descriptor—creating a mild purple sheen that occasionally risks numbing impact. There are a few near-redundancies around fog, frost, and light that could be trimmed for greater punch. Clarity remains intact, but some tightening would improve propulsion and make the best images land harder.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: varied syntax, clear sequencing, and many sentences doing double duty for image and emotion. Some metaphors are fresh and precise (“amber tears”), though a few are a touch ornamental, contributing to a slight purple sheen in places. There is modest conceptual repetition around vows, roots, and bridges that could be trimmed for sharpness. Still, there are no major artifacts, and the final lines land with a clean, concrete image rather than pure abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and largely avoids redundancy; nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and concept). Metaphors (“blossoms that shimmered like captured starlight,” droplets as “tiny, liquid planets”) are coherent and thematically apt, and there are no significant syntactic glitches or clarity breaks. There is a mild tendency toward density—stacked modifiers and named abstractions like “nonlinear inheritance” and “simply complicated”—that occasionally edges toward purple but does not obscure sense or closure. A touch more spareness around the climactic communion could heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and free of scaffolding or obvious loops, and the prose carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) efficiently. The figurative language is rich and mostly coherent, though nearly every line carries an image or abstraction, which edges toward over-saturation in places. A few phrases (“unheard symphony,” “pages turning toward dawn/understanding”) feel slightly recycled within this short length, but they do not materially obscure meaning or momentum. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the closing image is clear and well-shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally elegant and dense, with sentences doing multiple jobs—building atmosphere, advancing interiority, and reinforcing motifs. Rhythm varies well, and there are few if any genuine artifacts or confusions. The main limiter is a tendency toward over-articulated thematic lines and repeated key phrases (“unkindled solace,” “trapped freedom,” “Recapture was not retrieval; it was reverence.”) that slightly flatten the otherwise vivid imagery. Trimming a handful of explanatory or near-duplicate sentences would sharpen momentum and let the strongest images breathe even more.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, character, theme) without obvious redundancy, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and anchored (“like a watercolor touched by rain”), seldom veering into muddle or strain. There are no noticeable loops, scaffold phrases, or filter-verb stacks that sap momentum, and syntax remains clear even in more abstract moments. A few abstractions (“clarity, warm and certain”) could be grounded more, but they don’t materially harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world, mood, and motion), and rhythm modulates well between pressure and release. The main weakness is a tendency toward stacked modifiers and near-redundant intensifiers (“visceral, soul-deep imperative”; “peace with texture, weight, and profound depth”) that edge into purple and could be pared. There are few, if any, outright muddled metaphors or syntactic confusions, so closure remains crisp. Tightening 10–15% of the heaviest lines would move this into elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, sonically pleasing, and information-dense; most sentences carry both image and emotional or thematic weight. Figurative language is rich but generally controlled, with only occasional mild redundancy (the extended thistle metaphor is arguably one beat too long). Momentum holds well despite the lyricism; the sequence of actions around the alignment and rekindling stays clear and unencumbered by scaffolding or loops. No significant artifacts, tense slips, or metaphoric muddles touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with many doing double duty for setting and interiority. Figurative language is rich and often beautiful (“preemptively nostalgic sorrow,” “solidified fog,” “pearlescent white where mist had congealed into silent, unyielding marble”). However, the frequency of metaphor and modifiers flirts with purple prose, especially in the first half, and a few abstract formulations could be pared without loss. Despite this density, causality and the closing image remain clear and unaffected by artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythms and dense images that usually do more than one job (world-building, mood, and character in one move). Key metaphors—gravity of hopelessness, seed of light, filtering flame—are coherent and sustained, and line-level clarity remains intact despite lyricism. There is some repetition of favored phrases (“ambient awareness,” “gravity of hopelessness,” “hush”) and a mild tendency toward purple in places, but it doesn’t significantly stall momentum or blur sense. Information flows cleanly and the final image is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong rhythm and high information density—most lines do double duty for image and theme. However, metaphor and symbolism are almost continuous, creating a lushness that borders on overwrought and occasionally leads to explanatory lines that feel like glosses rather than images (“In this ebb, she saw the texture of their pause: not emptiness, but fertile ground…”). There are no major clarity issues, scaffold sentences, or loops, but a demanding editor would likely trim some abstract phrases to sharpen momentum. The final image is clear and charged despite the ornamental density.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) with high information density and little visible scaffold. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically aligned with silence, inversion, and growth; it rarely feels mixed or gratuitous. There is some conceptual redundancy and occasional purple-leaning abstraction, particularly in the late thematic formulations, which softens impact slightly. Nevertheless, rhythm, clarity, and image control remain solid through the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are musical, varied in length, and often do more than one job (worldbuilding plus emotion plus theme). At times, the prose edges into purple or self-conscious abstraction—phrases like “vaulting hush so profound it felt like the world itself was listening” and repeated engineering metaphors (“calibrated,” “catalyst,” “designed”) add a faint sense of overwriting. There are a few paraphrase-like reiterations of the same idea about silence’s nature that could be tightened. Nonetheless, clarity is never compromised, and the final image lands cleanly and with atmospheric power.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and motion) with few redundancies, and the rhythm varies with the scene’s needs. Imagery is inventive and mostly coherent, even when baroque (“liquid light shifting through hues of forgotten nebulae and drowned sunsets”). There is some tendency toward stacked modifiers and figurative density, especially early, that could be pared for even greater sharpness in a top-tier venue. Nonetheless, momentum and clarity are not significantly impeded, and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with rhythmic variation and many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. However, figurative language is very dense—“loaded emptiness,” “shy, sentient smoke,” “oxygen of presence”—and occasionally risks purple prose or conceptual repetition without adding new nuance. Several adjacent lines restate similar emotional content (emptiness, suffocation, release) in slightly different metaphors, which marginally slows momentum. Despite this, clarity remains high and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is vivid and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“towering fungal caps pulsed with soft cerulean, emerald, and violet light, casting dancing shadows that felt alive”). Line-level clarity is strong; cause and effect in the ritual and its aftermath are easy to follow. There is some conceptual and adjectival stacking (“shadowseam wonder incarnate,” “translate crushing pressure into diamonds of meaning”) that verges on purple and could be pared for greater impact. Still, there are few true loops or muddles, and the closure image is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is vivid, with strong verbs and multi-function sentences that advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously (e.g., “A fossilized echo of resonance”). The piece maintains clarity despite a high density of figurative language, and there are few, if any, true redundancies or structural scaffolds. That said, the prose occasionally tips toward purple, with metaphor stacked upon metaphor and repeated tonal phrases (“golden shadows,” “sepia,” “eloquently silent”) that slightly blunt impact and momentum. Trimming or varying a few of these would elevate the piece into a more rarefied tier.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, with few true redundancies or mechanical artifacts. However, figurative language is nearly continuous (“leviathan ribs,” “Möbius strips of light and shadow,” “bridge of understanding woven into existence’s tapestry”), which occasionally blurs emphasis and borders on purple. Some abstractions (“shape of possibility itself,” “pure potential”) repeat without additional concreteness, softening momentum in what should be peak-pressure lines. Overall readability and closure clarity remain high, but a demanding editor would likely trim and sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong images (“dust…unfurled a philosophy,” “a tiny, tarnished testament to love’s quiet bravery”) and good sentence-level rhythm. However, the line-level leans toward purple in places and cycles similar abstract formulations—“sanctuary of whispered resilience,” “examined unknown,” “hidden heart”—that start to feel redundant. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same insight about kindness and archives, slightly dulling momentum. Tightening those loops and trimming some of the overtly metaphoric language would bring it closer to top-tier literary finish.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is above average: sentences are mostly clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with few redundancies and no serious grammatical issues. Imagery around light, reflection, and gold is coherent and thematically apt, and the prose maintains momentum across a largely expository premise. That said, there is a persistent tendency toward purple abstraction and reiterated formulations (“coded freedom itself,” “tyranny of indifference”) that feel like commentary rather than scene, especially in the final third. Trimming a few declarative theme lines and tightening modifiers would give the existing images more force.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) and the prose reads smoothly aloud. Motifs like fog, light, and silence recur in a controlled pattern, and key beats are rendered through concrete images (the meadow, dewdrops on crystal tips). At times, the density of modifiers and coined phrases (“quietly vivid,” “garment of calm against dread”) edges toward purple, risking over-insistence on mood. Still, clarity and momentum hold, and there are no major loops or figurative muddles undermining the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and often lovely, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. That said, it leans toward purple at times, with dense modifiers and repeated constructions (“mossy delight,” “hush,” “sacred work”) that risk slight redundancy. There are no serious clarity issues, but a tighter line edit could trim ornamental phrasing without losing effect. Strong craft, just shy of the razor-sharp concision expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and do multiple jobs (advancing action while carrying mood and theme). Imagery is often striking (“obsidian pool,” “skeletal remains,” “swirling leaves”) and rhythmically pleasing. There is some redundancy and a touch of purple or over-explicit phrasing in the final third where realizations are spelled out rather than condensed into image. Still, there are no major loops or figurative muddles, and momentum holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line by line, the prose is largely clean, grammatically sound, and image-rich, with several striking formulations (e.g., rainwater “like liquid obsidian”). That said, figurative density is high and sometimes repetitive, especially around “luminous,” “golden,” and “mystical,” leading to a mild purple-prose sheen. A few adjacent sentences restate similar emotional or thematic content, particularly near the ending, slightly dulling momentum. The final explicit truth-statement functions more as essayistic summation than fresh image, softening the closure’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished, with strong sensory images (“luminous ache,” “whispering boots,” “spiderweb catching dawn light”) and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and nearly all carry atmospheric or character weight. There is some flirtation with purple prose and repeated metaphorical territory (e.g., “luminous ache” returns, and figurative density is high) but it remains intelligible and largely purposeful. No significant loops or artifacts blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong, with varied rhythm, high information density, and effective sensory layering. The piece occasionally overreaches into purple territory and repeats concepts (“ultraviolet penance,” “mathematics of mercy,” repeated “he brace”) in ways that feel like minor loops rather than fresh advances. Some abstract formulations (“his motivation burned with stellar intensity”) read more like scaffolding than lived perception. These issues lightly drag momentum but do not seriously obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong, dense, and rhythmically controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“This shard…held the ghost of salt spray and a keeper’s steadfast breath”). Information flows smoothly without scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and the closure image is clear. At times, figurative language stacks toward the purple (“eternal instant,” “time’s relentless tide”), slightly risking over-ornamentation, but it remains legible and pattern-consistent. The line-level craft is publishable quality even under a demanding standard, though not utterly flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, with vivid but controlled imagery (golden motes “drifting like dandelion seeds,” dust as historical record). There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and the prose flows without syntactic monotony. A few lines drift into abstraction or on-the-nose formulation (“his motivation now a solemn vow,” “gift mends cracks in reality’s façade”), which slightly undercuts immediacy. Still, no major figurative muddle or loops appear, and momentum is well maintained for a quiet piece.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally polished, imagistic, and efficient: most lines carry worldbuilding, tone, and motion simultaneously (“Cracks of light, not of breakage but of revelation…”). Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and figurative language, while frequent, remains coherent and controlled. There are mild redundancies and occasional purple-leaning abstractions, but they do not seriously impede clarity or momentum. Strong line-level craft that could be sharpened further by trimming a few explanatory or near-duplicate phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is rich, image-dense, and mostly controlled: metaphors like “time-filaments… flowing calligraphy of intention” and “liquid gold” are vivid and coherent with the story’s conceptual frame. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and nearly every line works double-duty for atmosphere and theme, keeping momentum despite the lyricism. The density of ornament occasionally approaches purple, but it does not materially obscure causality or the closure image. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or rhythmically mechanical stretches, which is rare at this level of lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, theme, emotion), and rhythm supports both reverence and urgency. Imagery is often striking (“a sound like the universe sighing relief”) and usually coherent. There is some density of figurative language and abstract phrasing that could be pared (“paradoxical art of mending what isn’t torn,” repeated covenant-of-rust explanations), which edges into mild overwriting. Even so, clarity at pivotal moments remains intact and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and almost no scaffolding or redundant loops; most sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, character, and theme). Imagery is generally precise and fresh, and rhythm modulates well from exploratory to contemplative. There is a mild tendency toward conceptual abstraction in the final lines (“quiet wisdom,” “calibrated not to north, but to grace”), which borders on purple but remains intelligible. Tighter, more image-based phrasing at the very end could heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is generally strong, with vivid images (“granite rib,” “turbine-hum reverie,” “its edge a whisper”) and good information density. However, figurative and thematic language is nearly continuous, leading at times to a slightly purple, overworked feel and some conceptual repetition around “timewoven” guidance and simplicity vs complexity. Trimming a handful of overt thesis sentences would sharpen momentum and give the best images more room to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; images often do multiple jobs at once (e.g., snowmelt mirroring emotional thaw). At times the language edges toward purple with stacked modifiers and abstractions (“sacred threshold,” “profound humility,” “hard-won truth”), which slightly dulls impact rather than sharpening it. Nonetheless, clarity remains high, there’s little scaffolding or repetition, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, details do double duty for atmosphere and character, and there’s minimal redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent (“pool of liquid night,” “truth drinks the moon”) rather than stacked or muddled. The momentum holds through long, dense sentences because information is layered carefully, and the closing paragraphs tighten rather than dissipate. A few phrases edge toward purple, but they don’t obscure causality or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and character) and maintain momentum despite a reflective mode. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. Phrases like “decade-long silence a physical weight” and “a perfect teardrop of fossilized resin holding a captured sunbeam” are lush yet precise, supporting tone and image. The main ceiling comes from near-constant metaphorical density, which risks saturation in a longer piece but remains effective at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and musical, with high information density—most sentences advance setting, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, and motifs (stone, horn, apple, silence) are reused rather than multiplied. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding sentences, or syntactic monotony; line-level rhythm supports the accumulative structure. The only restraint from an even higher score is that a few formulations edge close to “pretty for its own sake,” risking slight overrichness in a couple of beats.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, syntactically varied, and largely free of scaffolding; most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and thematic suggestiveness) without bogging down. Imagery is vivid and mostly coherent, with only occasional abstraction (“vortex inheritance,” “pure intention”) flirting with over-conceptualization, balanced by tactile counterweights (frost, soil, acorn, petal). Some phrase repetition and density of modifiers in close proximity edge toward purple but do not blur sense or obscure the closure image. Overall momentum is steady for a lyric piece, though a slightly leaner middle could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and densely imagistic without tipping into full purple; most sentences do double duty for mood and character. Recurring phrases (“favor listening over noise,” “solstice hush”) function more as intentional motifs than as sloppy repetition. There are no major clarity issues or structural scaffolds, though the closing paragraphs edge toward thematic paraphrase rather than fresh imagery. Overall, line-level craft is strong enough for publication with only minor tightening of redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level work is polished, largely grammatical, and often beautiful, with strong images like “dust motes danced like dormant stars” and the meteor’s “silver scar.” Many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and theme, and the final cadence is musically satisfying. That said, figurative and abstract language is very dense, leading to a slightly purple, repetitive feel (“vulnerability,” “stillness,” “dance,” “cosmic tapestry” recur without always adding new nuance). Some adjacent lines paraphrase similar insights, modestly flattening momentum and diminishing the sharpness of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images (“skeletal apiaries,” “brittle ghosts of lavender fields”) and good rhythmic variation. Most sentences do double-duty for atmosphere and theme, keeping density high. At times the language drifts into abstract noun clusters and similar constructions that feel slightly repetitious, especially near the end. It stops short of true purple prose, but a few lines could be sharpened by favoring concrete over conceptual phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences flow with varied rhythm, imagery is fresh (seconds as textures, seed/pollen metaphor), and most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and character at once). There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; exposition is compressed efficiently (e.g., the Chronos Guild, Great Shift) without clogging momentum. A few phrases tilt toward overt theme-statement or repeated vocabulary (“texture,” “time”) but don’t seriously blur clarity or cadence. The final beats are sharp and legible, with no muddled metaphors or structural artifacts dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is polished, with many strong images (“lagoon polished to liquid obsidian,” “a bridge between chaos and calm”) and clean grammar. That said, figurative density is high, with some repetition and near-purple flourishes that feel redundant or on-the-nose, especially around thematic restatements. Trimming a few echoed constructions (“burnished hush,” reiterated motivations) would increase propulsion and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong: clear syntax, vivid concrete images, and good economy for a lyric-leaning piece, with many sentences doing double duty (world-building and character). There is some repetition of concepts and phrasing—“brazen calm,” “gentle precision,” reiterations of legacy and presence—that borders on paraphrase rather than fresh deepening. A few abstract explanatory sentences near the end (e.g., summing his legacy and the meaning of the months) feel less alive than the earlier, more image-driven lines. Overall momentum holds and closure is not obscured, but occasional purple or redundant notes keep it below elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—many sentences do double duty for atmosphere, worldbuilding, and character. Sensory images like “bronze quiet,” “honey-colored tear of resin,” and “tears cutting clean paths through the dust” are vivid without generally tipping into muddle. There is some repetition of signature phrases (“bronze quiet,” “luminous skeptic,” the reiterated homecoming thesis) that reads slightly scaffold-like and a touch purple in the final third. Still, clarity and momentum remain strong, and no figurative confusion undercuts the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for image and theme. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to maintain momentum, and there are few if any true redundancies or scaffolding sentences. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, and a couple of lines drift into explanatory or abstract phrasing that slightly blunts impact (“This was the essence of narrow vastness,” “its blooms a silent, persistent argument for peace”). The piece skirts purple but remains largely clear and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished, often beautiful, and information-dense; many sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without feeling bloated. Recurrent phrases (“wild hush,” “translate distance into closeness”) land more as intentional motifs than careless repetition, though a few lines tip close to purple or redundant abstraction. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and well-matched to the emotional register. There are no major clarity issues or mechanical errors, and momentum is preserved despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, metaphors are mostly clean and concrete, and nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or thematic framing. Repetition of key motifs (silence, true north, confusion→exploration) is patterned rather than churning, though a few abstractions (“thrilling hypothesis,” “latent meaning”) could be sharpened into more embodied language. There is no major scaffolding, template cadence, or figurative muddle that impairs clarity, especially near the ending. The prose leans lush but remains controlled enough for this contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with evocative yet controlled imagery and minimal redundancy. The prose integrates exposition smoothly into action, avoiding clunky scaffolding or obvious loops. There is a mild tendency toward abstract labeling and stacked descriptors (“sacredly playful reverence,” “actively twisting the heavens”) that occasionally flirt with exposition over felt experience. Overall, rhythm and clarity hold, comfortably meeting publishable standards even if not yet at a razor-honed, sentence-by-sentence brilliance.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and generally efficient, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and action at once). Metaphoric density is high—“interregnum hung…like a held breath,” “luminous absence,” “nomadic penumbra”—but remains mostly coherent and legible, avoiding mixed or clashing images. There is minor risk of over-saturation and abstraction, which can slightly blunt immediacy, yet momentum and clarity largely hold. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only small trims needed for maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density and many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion, or action plus theme). Metaphor and image (e.g., “chasm of poetry,” “hidden thunder of suppressed sorrow”) are mostly coherent and evocative. There is some risk of over-saturation—figurative language is frequent enough that a few lines feel slightly purple or redundant. Still, clarity and momentum are maintained, and the closure image is sharp rather than muddied.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally strong: concrete, imagistic, and efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and meaning. Metaphors like “living chessboard arrested at checkmate” and “tears of remorse… could not fall in this frozen realm” are apt and clear, and there’s little in the way of scaffolding or synonym loops. There is some risk of density/purple drift with stacked descriptors (“gilded cage of silence,” “pattern resolved in his mind—a map of grace”), which at times state theme as well as show it. Still, clarity and momentum are never lost, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong imagery and generally efficient sentences that each advance atmosphere, character, or theme. There are a few instances of purple or near-redundant phrasing (“a symphony where blame dissolved into understanding,” “forged hush, dense and deliberate”) that risk overstatement but do not obscure meaning. Momentum holds throughout; there are no major scaffold or paraphrase loops, and syntax shows healthy variation. Tightening a handful of abstract or decorative lines would push this closer to elite-level compression.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically considered, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for setting, emotion, and theme. The figurative density is high—nearly every sentence bears an image or metaphor—which flirts with purple prose but rarely confuses the action. Phrases like "scent of ozone and regret" and "ghost of her lavender soap" are evocative yet legible, and causal sequences (gear failure, listing workshop, ritual steps) are easy to follow. A bit more sparseness at peak-pressure beats could heighten impact by contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: vivid, concrete imagery, generally efficient sentences that do double-duty for atmosphere and character, and a clear, propulsive through-line with little scaffolding or redundancy. The opening mirror sentence and the cave’s “liquid starlight” oasis are especially striking without losing clarity. That said, figurative density and compounded metaphors around the shell and “temporary eternity” occasionally verge on purple and explanatory, softening impact rather than sharpening it. These are minor slips; overall momentum and clarity remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, and the prose carries both scene and emotion efficiently. The motif of vibration and scent is handled with consistent metaphor rather than muddled figurative stacks. That said, there are moments of purple or redundant phrasing (“screaming tenderness,” repeated thesis lines) that slightly overstate what’s already clear in the images. These do not obscure meaning, but they do soften the sharpness expected at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are mostly efficient, with concrete detail doing double duty for setting and emotion, and there are few if any true scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and apt, with recurring metaphors (migration, geography, bridge) creating a stable conceptual field rather than mixed imagery. The main weakness is some repetition of key abstractions (“geography of loss,” “reverse migration,” “raw solace”) that could be trimmed or varied for maximum impact. Momentum is well sustained, especially through the build-and-circuit sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that often do double duty for mood and theme. Some phrases and concepts are repeated a touch too explicitly (e.g., “psychological safety,” the textbook quote) rather than letting earlier images carry the weight, which slightly flattens momentum in the closing stretch. Overall, density and clarity remain high and the prose supports rather than obscures the emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong sensory detail and a good read-aloud rhythm; most sentences carry more than one layer of work (image, mood, theme). However, figurative and abstract language is densely packed, especially around “gaps,” “witnessed isolation,” and “borrowed memories,” creating a mild sense of conceptual repetition. Several sentences approach pseudo-profundity by stating what the images already imply, which slightly blunts momentum and sharpness. Overall craft is high but not yet ruthlessly pared or surprising in its line-by-line turns.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and structure, and most carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language—“lived in the quiet spaces between ink and paper,” “golden light that felt like forgiveness”—is mostly clean and evocative, with no major mixed metaphors. There is some adjective and image stacking that edges toward purple in the cavern description, but it doesn’t seriously obscure meaning or momentum. Overall, the prose reads polished and publishable with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are fluid, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology, and there are few if any outright clunky constructions. Metaphors and images (“celestial wound weeping luminous sorrow,” “ridge’s jaw,” “emerald sparks”) are striking and mostly coherent. That said, the density of figurative language and modifiers is high across many consecutive sentences, which occasionally blurs emphasis and verges on over-ornamentation. A bit more restraint or sharper selectivity, especially near thematic statements, would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often beautiful, with high information density and images doing thematic and atmospheric work simultaneously (e.g., “a fossilized echo of cosmic geometry,” “embers rising like released breaths”). At times, metaphor and abstraction stack (“density of presence,” “hidden architecture,” “scientifically romantic truth”) to the edge of purple, and a few phrases repeat concept rather than add new pressure. Nonetheless, rhythm varies well, syntax is clear, and key beats remain fully intelligible. Line-level polish is strong but could benefit from a slight pruning of overt conceptual phrasing to sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images like “minutes bled into decades” and “feral nostalgia” do multiple jobs, and there’s little true scaffolding or redundancy. The prose largely balances density and clarity, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. There is some flirtation with purple prose and stacked abstractions (“utterly eclipsed,” “animalistic hunger for the unburdened certainty of a self”), which occasionally feels a shade overdetermined. Those minor excesses and slight repetition keep it out of the absolute top tier but still mark it as high-quality work.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished and often beautiful, with strong rhythm and high information density—most sentences do double duty for mood and character. That said, figurative language and abstracted phrases are dense enough that the piece occasionally borders on over-ornate, especially in thematically loaded lines near the end. There are a few conceptual redundancies around “ordinary miracles,” “unveiling beauty,” and “mending the world” that could be trimmed for even greater impact. Clarity and momentum remain intact throughout, but a touch more spareness under pressure would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology (“a disc of ancient granite beaded with rain from the departed storm” both sets scene and mood). Figurative language (e.g., scars as “liquid starlight”) is vivid and largely controlled, rarely tipping into muddle or overload. There is little scaffolding or repetition; momentum is maintained even through reflective passages. A few thematic abstractions and slightly ornate phrases prevent it from feeling utterly razor-cut at an elite level, but they don’t materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and emotion, and the prose passes a read-aloud test for rhythm and clarity. That said, figurative language is heavily stacked (“cathedral of suspended breath,” “ethereal grit coated her soul,” etc.), sometimes in adjacent lines, pushing toward purple and slightly dulling impact through saturation. There is minor conceptual redundancy (reiterating the imperfect-miracle idea in different phrasings) but no serious loops or scaffolding. The closure image remains clear and effective, so the main deduction comes from occasional overwriting rather than confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, carry multiple functions (world, theme, action), and maintain momentum despite the contemplative mode. Figurative language is mostly coherent and controlled, with recurring images (light, hush, spiral) creating texture without devolving into mixed metaphors. There is some mild abstraction and echoing of terms (“silence,” “hush,” “truth,” “essence”) that could be pared back for maximum sharpness, but they do not seriously blur sense or closure. The final beats (“I am,” the wave of silent light, the humming silence) land clearly and rhythmically.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally efficient yet textured, and most images are coherent and mutually reinforcing (water, mirrors, edges, silence). There is some tendency toward stacked modifiers and high-density metaphor (“surgically precise line,” “ancient conversation,” “silver tear returning to the sky”), but they remain legible and don’t blur causality. Redundancy is minimal; each paragraph advances scene, atmosphere, or idea. The final paragraphs risk mild overstatement but still move with momentum rather than collapsing into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often accomplishing atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously without obvious scaffolding. Phrases like “a cathedral of release” or “quiet wildfire of connection” are striking and mostly clear, and there are few if any syntactic or grammatical slips. There is some tendency toward purple or piled abstraction in the later paragraphs, with closely packed metaphors and explicit summary of insight, which slightly dulls the immediacy of the peak beat. Still, momentum and clarity are maintained, and the closing image lands cleanly at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant, image-rich, and largely free of scaffold or repetition; nearly every sentence pulls weight for atmosphere, character, or theme. Motifs like mica, clover, and traversal recur with clear variation rather than synonym churn, and the read-aloud rhythm is strong. There are moments of near-purple abstraction and explicit labeling (“gentle imperative,” “responsible perspective-widening”) that could be pruned for even greater sharpness and momentum. Still, clarity remains high, and no figurative muddle or loops harm the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences do at least double duty in mood, theme, or character. Musical and circulatory metaphors are sustained and largely coherent; lines like “a resonant thrum felt through concrete and bone” work both sonically and thematically. There is some risk of purple density, but it stops short of muddling clarity or momentum, and repetition is motif-driven rather than scaffolding. Minor over-articulation in a few thematic statements is the main factor keeping this from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, grammatically clean, and often do two or three jobs at once (advancing ritual, evoking setting, and deepening emotion). Key images (steam as ghost, blossoms as transformed grief) are effective and coherent. There is some repetition of concepts/phrases (“weight,” “gently thorough,” “proximate causes”) and a touch of purple in stacked modifiers, but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or slow momentum. A light trim of redundancies and a few abstractions would sharpen already very good prose.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and images that generally carry both atmosphere and theme (“time pooled like spilled ink beneath the frozen clock tower”). Prose avoids major loops or scaffolding, and most figurative language is coherent and apt. There is some abstraction and theme-statement phrasing in the final third, but it doesn’t obscure sense or dull the closure image; it just edges toward over-explanation. Overall, the writing would need only light tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious padding. Sensory metaphors are generally clean and coherent with the story’s sonic/tactile logic. There is some repetition of structures and key phrases, and occasional near-platitudinous formulations, but they don’t significantly blunt momentum or obscure closure. Overall, line-level craft is solidly above average and largely publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) at once. Vivid metaphors like “spacetime pooled like spilled ink” and the humming, yielding metal are clear and resonant. That said, figurative language and abstract terminology are stacked thickly enough in places that they flirt with purple and occasionally restate ideas (regret into resolve, seeds/threads/web) rather than advancing them. The prose is clearly above-average but could benefit from a few strategic cuts for maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level work is polished, with strong rhythmic control and many sentences doing double duty for mood and characterization (“His fingers, etched with age yet fluid as water…”). There is a high density of figurative language and repeated formulations (“joyful sorrow,” “translate silence into music”) that edges toward purple and mild looping but doesn’t quite tip into muddle. Momentum holds despite lyricism, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. A ruthless edit could trim a few redundant abstractions without harming the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level writing is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty (advancing plot while enriching theme or setting). Figurative language tends to be apt and resonant—scars as music, tears as “hot as embers yet gentle as dew”—though the metaphor load is high and occasionally feels ornamental. Repeated coinages like “volcanic tenderness” and explicit thematic summaries introduce a touch of overwriting. Still, momentum remains intact and closure is clear, so the stylistic excesses are noticeable but not structurally damaging.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“liquid gold swirled like captured dawn,” “auroral sorrow saturated the air”) and generally high information density; most lines carry both atmosphere and story work. Some metaphor stacking and intensifier density push toward purple, but they rarely confuse the literal action or obscure stakes. Repetition is mostly purposeful (drumming, auric imagery) rather than looped scaffolding. A slightly leaner line in a few places would sharpen impact, but current craft is already solidly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: rhythmic variety, concrete sensory detail, and multi-tasking sentences that build atmosphere while advancing action. Phrases like “whispers of the containers seemed to hum in agreement” border on purple but remain coherent and thematically aligned. There is some conceptual repetition around the whisper/shout contrast and Kael’s philosophy, but it doesn’t significantly stall momentum or obscure causality. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final line lands with a clear, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and high information density; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and emotional shading. Imagery is generally coherent and well-chosen, and there are no major clarity issues or obvious scaffolding loops. However, modifiers and metaphors are quite dense (“spiralingly calm,” “stillwater tension,” “polished obsidian”), occasionally flirting with purple prose and reducing impact by over-insistence. A touch more restraint and variation in figurative load would sharpen the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, image-dense, and largely free of scaffolding or repetition; most lines do multiple jobs in character, mood, and theme. Metaphors (forests of second thoughts, amplified quiet, magnetic grotto) are coherent and sustained rather than stacked haphazardly. Momentum holds despite lyricism; information flow remains clear through the climax and closing image. A few phrases verge on overt thematic labeling, but they don’t materially blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are generally precise, sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, character), and the piece reads smoothly aloud. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and thematically aligned with the sea and transformation. Some phrases and ideas are repeated a bit too directly (“combative tenderness” as a coined term; explicit thematic restatements) and a few sentences could be trimmed without loss, but these do not seriously obscure clarity or dull the closure image. Overall, the prose is polished and near-ready for high-level publication with minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is highly polished: images like “blades carving the gray sky into measured segments of silence and sound” and “faded to the color of old bruises” are vivid, apt, and rhythmically controlled. Sentences vary in length and structure, maintaining momentum while allowing for lyric pauses; nearly every line carries multiple functions (setting, character, theme). There is minor over-explicitness in a few late-theme sentences, but no real redundancy, metaphor muddle, or syntactic monotony. Line-level craft comfortably meets elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and sonically attentive, with generally tight sentences that multitask—advancing image, mood, and concept at once. Some phrases (“a new aesthetic truth was born,” “tremor of certainty”) edge toward abstraction or repetition, and a few constructions lean purple, but they don’t seriously muddy sense or stall momentum. Imagery is frequent yet mostly coherent and thematically aligned with fluidity and dissolution. The closing cadence is clear and satisfying, with minimal scaffold or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: vivid, precise images (“Shards of molten glass glittered like frozen tears among stubborn green shoots”) and efficient, multi-tasking sentences dominate. The prose generally balances lyricism with clarity, and there’s little true redundancy or scaffolding. That said, the last third accrues abstract nouns and theme-labeled phrases, creating a slight sense of over-explanation and softening the sharpness of earlier images. Tightening those summaries into a few charged images would raise momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (image, theme, character) and maintain momentum despite a lyric density. Recurrent motifs (“golden shadows,” the lens, seeds vs. artifacts) feel deliberate rather than like synonym churn, and there are no significant clarity lapses. The prose skirts purple at times with stacked figurative language, but physical logic holds and metaphors are generally coherent. Trimming a few redundant conceptual restatements would heighten impact further but the closure image remains sharp and undulled.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty (moving emotion and image), and there’s little true scaffolding or synonym churn. Recurrent phrases (“genuinely artificial,” “teach the withering to bloom again,” “curtains of intention”) feel more like deliberate motifs than loops. There is mild risk of purple edging in places, with stacked abstractions and thematic terms clustering in later paragraphs, but clarity remains intact and closure is not dulled. Tighter trimming of a few overtly explanatory lines would make the already-good prose even more incisive.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is sensuous and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is generally precise and thematically aligned (maps as nervous systems, ink as constellations), and rhythm varies well. There is a minor artifact (“[12”) and a tendency toward high descriptive density that risks purple in places, though it rarely tips into muddle. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publishable, just shy of the absolute top tier due to that artifact and occasional heaviness.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do more than one job, weaving atmosphere with interiority and advancing the ritual’s progress. Figurative language is generally coherent and thematically aligned, and there are few if any true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The prose risks density—multiple abstract nouns in close succession, repetition of “anguished joy,” and some ornate constructions—but it remains legible and rhythmic. Slight trimming of modifiers and abstractions in the final third would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery and generally efficient sentences doing double duty (world-building and emotional shading). There is a clear rhythmic control, alternating long, flowing descriptive lines with shorter, forceful statements at key turns (“She had clung to the river stone’s simplicity…”). At times the language approaches purple, with stacked abstractions and repeated luminous/hope imagery that could be pared back for even more impact. Still, clarity is never compromised and momentum holds across the reflective arc.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level work is polished, with strong sensory specificity and generally good information density—most sentences do at least two jobs. There is, however, a noticeable tendency toward purple prose and abstraction stacking (“quietly vivid tapestry of sensory details,” “clarified spirit,” repeated “shimmering stillness”), which can feel over-curated and occasionally redundant. Despite the lushness, clarity is never seriously compromised and the closure image reads cleanly. Trimming or grounding a handful of the more ornamental metaphors would sharpen momentum and emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, dense, and purposeful, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Sensory details and metaphors are vivid, though figurative language is very frequent, occasionally flirting with purple or redundancy (reiterated formulations of closure and miracle). Despite this, clarity and momentum are maintained; there are no major loops or syntactic artifacts that obscure action or thought. A touch more spareness, especially in the final third’s thematic statements, would lift the craft into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and interiority (“a temporal echo of her own quest,” “the busker’s melody swelled below”). There is some tendency toward stacked figurative language and familiar intensifiers (“hushed thunder,” “shook her soul without sound”) that slightly dull freshness and momentum. Nonetheless, the writing remains clear, grammatically clean, and purposeful, with few if any genuine scaffolding or paraphrase loops. A modest pruning of metaphors in the middle third would sharpen impact and bring this closer to elite line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatically clean, and rhythmically pleasing, with some striking images (“needles of light stitching moments together,” “a timeline measured in heartbeats, not dates”). Information density is good; most sentences do at least two jobs (atmosphere plus emotion, or theme plus action). However, figurative language is thickly layered, and several lines paraphrase similar ideas (“trapped creativity,” “cage of her own making,” “door she alone had sealed”), creating mild redundancy and a faint purple sheen. This slightly dulls momentum in a piece that otherwise reads smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically controlled, and dense with image; most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and mood at once). Recurrent terms (“spark,” “glow,” “bloom”) are purposeful but verge on monotony, and figurative density occasionally approaches purple without breaking clarity. There are no major loops, scaffolding sentences, or syntactic artifacts dragging momentum. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publication-ready, with only minor tightening needed for variation and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythm varies, and many lines do double duty in worldbuilding and mood. Figurative language is abundant but usually coherent with the mechanical-organic conceit. There is some repetition and mild purple-prose drift—especially in the closing third, where similar insights are restated with slightly different metaphors—which softens momentum and impact. Still, no major artifacts obscure meaning, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: images are vivid, syntax is smooth, and most sentences carry multiple functions (atmosphere + emotion + theme). There is some redundancy in motifs and phrases (shoreline lullaby, twilight vigil, gentle wisdom) and a tendency toward stacked metaphor that occasionally feels purple. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained throughout, and the final beats land cleanly without figurative muddle. A touch more spareness or contrast would elevate the prose from strong to truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“shard of frozen sky,” “frostbitten hope”) and generally high information density; most sentences advance character, mood, or stakes. There are no major clarity issues or scaffolding loops, and rhythm adjusts well between description and decision. At times, metaphor and abstract phrasing stack a bit thickly, risking purple edges and slight momentum drag. Trimming a few heightened turns of phrase or conceptual restatements would tighten an already strong line-level performance.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, varied in structure, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for world-building and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, rarely slipping into mixed metaphors or outright purple prose, and the final movement is particularly well-controlled. There is some redundancy in emphasizing Kael’s duty and the regality/unpretentiousness contrast, and nearly every sentence carries an image or abstraction, which risks saturation. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved throughout, and the closure image is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm and paragraphing are varied, with strong images (“skeletal structure of recycled polymer and steel,” “chemical whispers guiding coral larvae”) that carry both world-building and emotion. Most lines do multiple jobs—advancing atmosphere, theme, and character simultaneously—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. There is a mild tendency toward conceptual density and thesis-like phrasing in the AI’s diagnostic text and a few closing sentences, which edges toward didacticism but doesn’t significantly impede clarity or momentum. Figurative language is frequent but generally consistent and coherent, keeping the prose just this side of overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, well-shaped, and information-dense, and many images (“first star pierced the dome’s wound like a needle of hope”) are memorable. However, figurative language is nearly continuous—metaphor and abstraction are stacked in many sentences—which at times verges on purple and risks dulling impact. There are light conceptual redundancies around “meaning,” “lull,” and “serenity” that could be tightened. Momentum holds, but judicious pruning would heighten force and readability.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, high information density, and vivid but generally precise imagery (“steam rose in ghostly plumes,” “bubbles dance like joyful spirits”). There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or action. At times the figurative language approaches the threshold of purple, but it largely remains coherent and purposeful rather than showy for its own sake. Rhythm and clarity are maintained even at the emotional and conceptual peak, supporting closure cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is mostly clean, grammatically sound, and often lovely in its concrete details (sea mist, pine scent, gravel crunch, cypress tips ignited by sunlight). Many sentences do useful double duty, advancing both atmosphere and interior state. Yet there is substantial repetition of key phrases and structures (“pearl of stillness,” “somatic markers,” the realism/optimism binary, parallel “This X was Y” formulations) that begins to feel looped rather than intensifying. That sameness saps momentum and edges toward purple/conceptual overgrowth, especially in the middle third, keeping the line craft below publish-now caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, theme) with good rhythmic variation, and most metaphors are coherent and sensorially grounded. Some lines stack lush metaphors and adjectives (“silvery threads spilled like liquid starlight, glowing with a sorrowful luminescence”) that approach purple but stop short of obscuring meaning. The prose occasionally leans on repeated abstractions (“necessary darkness,” “luminescent ache”) yet avoids true redundancy loops. Momentum is preserved throughout; no paragraphs feel like removable scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally beautiful, dense, and purposeful, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and meaning (“a patient sculptor of centuries,” “a willing pilgrim”). There is some mild purple-ness and conceptual redundancy in the ending stretch (“He had sought a cosmic law…”; “a truth as transient as the ink”) where explanation and motif restatement stack instead of advancing. Nonetheless, clarity is never compromised, and rhythm remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences have rhythmic variation, and many pull double duty for atmosphere and character. Some metaphors and intensifiers (“cathedral of frozen memory,” “contraband truths in its purest, most corrosive form,” “scandalize the city’s soul”) stack toward purple, and there are a few near-repetitions of concepts (silence/quiet/dizzying quiet; weight of snow vs. weight of decision). Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained; key beats are not obscured by ornament. Pruning a few overtly rhetorical lines would lift this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, largely free of scaffolding or syntactic clutter, and uses strong, specific imagery (“tiny bell of renewal,” “molten gold and violet”) that does multiple jobs at once. Line-level rhythm and clarity remain high throughout, with no serious metaphor muddle or structural confusion. There is a slight tendency toward repetition and purple flourish (“weave continuity through chaos” twice, “tranquil blaze,” “engraved quiet”) that risks over-insisting on its motifs. Still, momentum is maintained for this quiet mode, and the final lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is rich and image-dense yet mostly avoids redundancy and mixed metaphors; lines typically do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and pressure) at once. Rhythm varies well between long, textured sentences and punchier beats at moments of impact (“She struck the glowing rail spike into the vortex’s heart.”). Figurative language is frequent but purposeful, and doesn’t materially obscure action or closure. A few phrases verge on purple or abstract (“wave of profound understanding”), but these are isolated and don’t materially drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and several striking images (“stone chamber floated above an endless sea of cloud”) that also carry narrative work. A few phrases edge toward purple or repetitive metaphor (“orbits of regret,” “crystalline loneliness,” “crushing orbits”) and the closing generalization about truth reads more like a thesis sentence than an image. Nonetheless, line-level clarity and momentum remain intact, with no major scaffolding loops or syntactic clutter obscuring cause and effect. With a touch more restraint and trust in implication, this would be ready for high-level venues.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and evocative figurative language that often does multiple jobs at once (e.g., beeswax and sorrow in the desk). Line-level rhythm is varied and mostly propulsive, and key images (the amber, the wasp, the chime) are sharply rendered. However, there are visible artifacts—bracketed numbers like “[8” and “[10” and one duplicated clause (“The handwritten letters had promised this”)—which break immersion and would need editorial cleanup for elite publication. A few phrases (“meteor hush,” “universe witnessing reconciliation”) edge toward purple but remain intelligible.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character, and the piece reads smoothly aloud with varied rhythm and clear syntax. Imagery is rich and largely precise—lilac mist, sand colors, emotional textures—without major mixed metaphors or logic breaks, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. That said, figurative density is consistently high, especially in early paragraphs, edging toward purple in places and occasionally softening momentum. Trimming a few abstract descriptors and letting key images breathe would sharpen the impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most lines do multiple jobs, advancing setting, theme, and emotion simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, and key images (ash, tessera, steel, shattered sky) recur with increasing charge rather than as decorative churn. There is some redundancy and near-platitudinous phrasing (“perfect paradox,” “meticulous act of love,” “necessary mercy of hope”) that edges toward purple and could be trimmed for tautness. Still, clarity and momentum are maintained, and the closure image is not muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean for their lyricism, information-dense, and syntactically varied, with figurative language that is coherent and sensorially grounded in Elara’s synesthesia. There are few, if any, true redundancies or looped paraphrases; nearly every line does atmospheric or emotional work. However, figurative density is very high across the piece, so even though individual metaphors are competent, the cumulative effect occasionally feels close to purple and might benefit from a few plainer beats for contrast. This density is the main limiter keeping the prose from absolute top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level writing is generally strong, with vivid sensory images (ozone scent, liquid starlight, camera “drinking” photons) and mostly efficient sentences. There is some repetition (“fractally precise” appears multiple times) and a tendency toward abstract nouns and stacked concepts (“somatic markers,” “embodied truth,” “pathways”) that flirt with purple prose. Despite this, clarity is maintained and momentum is acceptable for a quiet, reflective piece; most sentences do at least two jobs. Trimming a few expository or redundant phrases would sharpen an already effective style.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character) with clean syntax and pleasing rhythm. Some moments verge on purple or expository redundancy, especially where the narrative explains the miracle’s scientific validation rather than trusting the image. Still, there are no major loops or artifacts, and the final images (map as guide, fossil in the crevice, warmth in her chest) land clearly and musically.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: high information density, varied syntax, and images that often do double duty for setting and theme. Metaphors are frequent but mostly coherent, and motifs (buttons, sand, silence, echo) are tightly woven into the prose. There is some redundancy in conceptual phrasing and a saturation of figurative language that borders on purple, which slightly blunts momentum and sharpness. Nonetheless, clarity and propulsion hold, and the final sentences land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with imagery that usually pulls its thematic weight—mist as confession, snow as vanishing message, thaw as inner shift. Sentence-level clarity is high; actions and emotional beats are easy to follow with little scaffolding or redundancy. There is some drift toward purple and abstraction in the final third (“unused courage had not been buried in regret,” “some fractures let in light,” etc.), which slightly reduces sharpness and freshness. Overall, though, momentum holds and most lines are doing multiple jobs without obvious loops or muddled metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally tight, musical, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Recurring metaphors (percolation, palimpsest, weaving/mending) are controlled and coherent rather than piled on haphazardly. There’s minimal redundancy and no significant scaffold or loop artifacts; the line-level clarity supports, rather than obscures, the emotional turn. Occasional abstract formulations nibble at concision, but they don’t dull the closure image or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight and high-quality, with strong imagery and minimal scaffolding; most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and thematic seeding simultaneously). There is some risk of saturation from frequent figurative turns, but they remain coherent and rarely feel overwrought or redundant. Rhythm and paragraphing provide momentum despite the reflective mode, and there are no obvious loops or mechanical artifacts. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor potential trims for density.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythms and dense images doing multiple jobs at once (character, mood, setting). However, the prose sometimes edges into overwriting—stacked modifiers and repeated conceptual tags (“sacred threshold,” “protected vulnerability,” “wistfully pragmatic heart”) could be trimmed for tautness. A few adjacent sentences paraphrase similar emotional content, especially near the ending, softening momentum. None of this obscures sense or closure, but a demanding editorial standard would ask for tightening to reach top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and purposeful imagery that usually does double duty (world-building plus emotion). The recurring “brittle awakening” and similar phrases risk minor redundancy, but they function as motif more than scaffold. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly precise and coherent; purple excess is limited. Aside from the stray “[418” artifact, there is little extraneous wording, and momentum carries cleanly through to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and image-dense, with many lines doing double duty for setting and theme (“every secret left became a stitch, every visitor a thread”). Syntax is varied, and the narrative flows without evident scaffolding, redundancy, or grammatical slips. Some metaphoric stacking (threads, webs, tapestries, spirals) risks mild overload but largely stays coherent and thematically aligned. The closing paragraphs maintain clarity and cadence without purple drift, supporting the closure cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, information-dense, and often do double duty (world-building plus emotion, concept plus action). There is some tendency toward abstraction and coined phrases (“celestial puppeteers,” “cosmic game continued”) that pile up and occasionally feel a touch purple, but they rarely impede clarity. Repetition of certain conceptual terms (hope, fragile, cosmic/ethereal language) nudges at over-patterning without becoming outright loop. Rhythm and concision are good enough that momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and images that often carry multiple jobs (emotion, worldbuilding, and theme). Rhythm varies well, and there are few if any true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. However, figurative language is very frequent—“liquid light,” “tightening like a fist,” “silent tapestry of constellations”—creating a consistently lush texture that occasionally risks over-saturation. A bit more austerity at peak beats could sharpen impact and avoid the sense of near-constant metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences carry multiple duties (setting, interiority, theme) with good rhythm and minimal scaffolding, and key images are clear and memorable. There is some repetition of conceptual pairs and phrasing around “unifying opposites” and the stone/silk motif that edges toward over-insistence but doesn’t obscure sense. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly apt, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. A light tightening of a few nearly redundant lines in the closing third would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.7)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, well-paced, and often do multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, and plot) without feeling bloated. Recurrent images (damp, bruised sky, spongey dread, copper nail) are controlled and not overextended, though “dread” and “exile” are named a few times where image alone might suffice. There are no significant loops, syntax glitches, or metaphor muddles that impede momentum or clarity. The closing section leans a bit on explanatory phrasing rather than trusting the already-earned images, but the cadence still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (“glass flake…more like a seed—its cracks promising new growth”). However, there is a noticeable tendency toward conceptual abstraction and motif repetition (luminous, pixelated, amnesty, sculpting possibility) that occasionally verges on purple and slightly dilutes impact. Some lines paraphrase existing ideas with higher rhetoric rather than adding new pressure or detail. Despite this, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the closing cadence is clean and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid metaphors and tight, image-rich openings and closings that carry atmosphere. Most sentences do double duty—advancing mood and theme together—and mechanical clarity is sound. There is some tendency toward purple or slogan-like abstraction (“dusky harmony of acceptance,” “every rise carries the blueprint of its fall”) and stacked metaphor, which can feel slightly heavy-handed. Still, line-level craft remains above average, with no major loops or scaffolding that sap momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, sonically pleasing, and generally multi-purpose, advancing atmosphere and character together. A few lines edge toward abstraction or redundancy (“A profound peace settled within her; the weight dissolved into connection”), and the closing paragraphs stack thematic declarations more than necessary. Figurative language is mostly clean and coherent, without mixed metaphors or purple overload. With some pruning of explicit “meaning” statements, the prose would be exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, and plot), and rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum through dense description. There are striking phrases (“her calm was not peace, but the focused stillness of a blade before the strike”) that feel precise rather than showy. That said, figurative language is extremely frequent and sometimes redundant (“guarded heart was armored in thorns of solitude,” “storm of sorrow,” “melting denial with gentle warmth”), creating a faint purple-glow and occasional sense of paraphrase-looping in emotional commentary. Tightening a few over-explained or metaphor-saturated lines would sharpen impact without sacrificing music.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid metaphors (“cobalt shadows swirled like liquid twilight,” “the unnatural dusk a scar”) and good information density—most sentences carry world, mood, and character simultaneously. There is a high figurative load, but images are coherent and not significantly mixed, and line rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum. Occasional repetitions and slightly purple turns nudge toward excess but do not obscure clarity or the closure image. There’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym churn, and the final beats land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich and mostly purposeful, with many sentences carrying dual loads of atmosphere and character insight (e.g., “He practiced inlaying meaning everywhere: seeing sacred geometry in root spirals…”). Rhythm varies well between lush description and tighter ritual beats, and there are no major clarity or grammar issues. There is some redundancy and near-purple abstraction (“His motivation was fulfilled”; repeated motif statements) that could be trimmed for even sharper impact. Overall, line-level craft is strong but not yet razor-edged enough for the very top bracket.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with a good balance between concrete detail and interior reflection. Recurring motifs (echo, valley, applause, service) are woven through without becoming fully redundant, and there are few if any outright clumsy lines. There is a mild tendency toward over-explicit thematic phrasing and abstract noun clusters (“purpose after loss,” “workshop of redemption”) that risk edging into purple or didactic, especially near the end. Still, these do not obscure causality or dull the closure image, so the momentum and clarity remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and efficient, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Imagery like “a colossal tree of woven ironwood and shimmering magnetic filaments” and “a silent, graceful unspooling of luminescent energy” feels controlled rather than overwrought. Minor phrases such as “tears traced clean paths” and “gardener of hope” flirt with cliché and soften the otherwise precise register. Still, momentum and clarity are strong, and there are no meaningful artifacts or redundancies dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is generally polished: sentences are well-shaped, imagery is often striking, and most lines carry more than one function (world, mood, and theme at once). That said, figurative language is very dense—metaphor and elevated descriptors appear in nearly every sentence—so the texture can feel overwrought and slightly blur emphasis. A few lines paraphrase a point already made in different words, adding ornament more than momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density—many sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Yet figurative language and elevated modifiers are stacked heavily throughout (“cathedral silence,” “latent radiance,” “sacred junction of shared fragility”), approaching purple in places and risking desensitization. A few concepts and phrases recur with minimal new pressure (“resonant hush,” “latent radiance,” walls dissolving), edging into mild redundancy. Rhythm and clarity remain good, but some tightening and restraint would likely be required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with vivid yet controlled figurative language (“a chaotic archive of hopes and regrets”). The recurring imagery of river, erosion, and patched bellows is handled with mostly disciplined restraint. There is mild redundancy and a few purple-leaning or paraphrastic lines in the final third, where thematic statements repeat what the images already show. These don’t obscure closure but keep the prose just shy of a fully spare, elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most lines do double work for atmosphere and character. There is some repetition of key phrases (“unfolding cipher,” “propagation delays”) and a slight tendency toward purple abstraction, but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or slow momentum. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and metaphors are largely coherent with the established fantastical logic. The closing images land clearly and musically, without scaffold or paraphrase loops dulling the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and largely precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and emotion; the glacier-note and liquid light ripple are standout lines. However, figurative density is very high—metaphors and abstractions stack in many consecutive sentences (“perforated destiny,” “mulberry ache,” “promise loses its glow,” etc.), occasionally feeling like purple saturation rather than necessary pressure. There are few, if any, outright muddled images, but a leaner line in places would increase impact and momentum. Clarity at the climax and closure remains intact, so the stylistic excess is more a matter of taste and pacing than structural harm.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is polished, with few if any syntactic or logical slips, and many sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). However, figurative density is very high—nearly every line carries metaphor or grand abstraction—which edges toward purple and slightly blurs immediacy. There’s some repetition in conceptual terrain (radiance, hush, light, essence) that could be pared without loss. Even so, clarity at key beats (the mandala, the infusion, the vial) remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong images (“vineyard hush,” “pearl gleaming like a captured tear of joy”) and sentences that do multiple jobs. There is some purple tendency and conceptual redundancy, especially around forgiveness, rebirth, and contentment, with several lines restating similar insights. Sentence rhythm leans heavily on long, flowing structures, which occasionally muddies momentum and dilutes impact. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained, grammar is clean, and no major figurative muddle harms the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythm, high information density, and metaphors that mostly cohere with the maritime, reflective frame (cloak, shard, wind, light). The prose rarely loops or pads; nearly every sentence advances either atmosphere or emotional pressure. A slight overuse of conceptual phrases (“calcified his spirit,” “sincerely insincere,” “capacity to see its painful, beautiful complexity”) edges toward essayistic abstraction, but not enough to blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and packed with meaningful information, and the imagery around water, magnetism, and light is often striking. There is some density creep toward purple—abstract nouns and thesis-like restatements (“This was the core of his work”; “The lesson woven through trance and rings was complete”) slightly dull momentum and feel redundant. Figurative language remains coherent and thematically aligned, with no major mixed-metaphor or clarity failures. A light tightening of repeated concepts and overt summary would likely bring this to a publishable polish.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and image-dense, with many sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, emotional coloring, and thematic work concurrently. Line-level clarity holds despite the heavy metaphor load, and there are few genuine paraphrase loops or muddled comparisons. At times the density of modifiers and similes edges toward purple, particularly when several ornate images cluster without added pressure, which slightly blunts momentum. Tightening a few overlush lines would likely move this into truly top-tier line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion; theme plus action) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Imagery like “brilliant dimness,” “mercury-waterfalls flowed upward,” and “liquid light that chimed like crystal bells” is fresh and coherent within the established magical logic. The density of figurative language occasionally comes close to over-rich, but clarity and momentum remain intact, and there are no significant loops or template cadences. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final paragraphs land with a precise, charged simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and densely informative, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Phrases like “a cathedral of drowned knowledge” or “their journey creating a profound meteor hush” are striking and precise. That said, figurative language is thickly layered in nearly every sentence, which sometimes risks purple-prose saturation and diminishes the impact of the strongest images. There are a few conceptual redundancies (“luminous vows” and hush/light imagery reiterated) that could be pared back to sharpen momentum and leave more air around crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong images like “a silent museum of cosmic expansion now concluded” and the universe as a “condensed tapestry of every star, galaxy, and moment.” Information density is high: most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus theme or emotion). There is, however, some figurative overload and repetition—tapestry, thread, stitch, museum, sanctuary, pearl, light, remembrance—creating a mildly purple feel and occasional redundancy (“Backwards prophecy was not mystery—it was memory given voice” restates what’s already dramatized). Despite that, clarity remains high and the closing cadence is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are generally efficient while carrying multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and emotional state), and the rhythm supports the accumulating ritual without bogging down. Figurative language (“slow bleed of dusk,” “each particle a tiny chronicle”) is mostly apt and not overstacked, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. A mild tendency toward ornate phrasing and stacked modifiers in early descriptive passages edges close to purple but never quite tips into muddle or confusion. Overall, clarity and momentum remain solid through the climax and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (image, worldbuilding, and emotional shading) and the rhythm supports the meditative build toward the bell’s restoration. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and thematically aligned; the rare slightly purple or reiterative phrase (“brittle devotion,” “torn fabric,” “cosmic imbalance”) doesn’t materially blur sense or dull the climax. There are no significant scaffold loops or mechanical artifacts, and information flow stays clear even under the lush style.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and meaning, and rhythm that suits a contemplative, lyric piece. However, there is noticeable density of abstractions and similar constructions (“spin these unearthed fragments into shared meaning,” “precisely humane attribute,” “compass of connection”) that sometimes paraphrase what has already been shown. The repeated thematic lexicon (memory, meaning, connection, mirrored hush) borders on redundancy and could be trimmed for sharper impact. A bit of tightening and reduction of purple tendencies would bring the line-level craft up to elite standard.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is polished, with rich imagery and a generally strong ear for cadence; most sentences do double duty in advancing atmosphere and character. Motifs like the waterfall, starlings, and crystal are threaded without obvious redundancy, and the action of the ritual is clearly sequenced. There is some risk of purple prose and metaphor density (“liquid prism,” “living inkblot,” “liquid luminescence”) that occasionally feels ornamental rather than strictly necessary, but clarity of causality and the closure image remain intact. Scaffold or paraphrase loops are minimal, and information density is high without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and often beautiful, with strong information density per line. However, it tends toward purple in places—frequent invocations of silence, echo, trust, and burden risk feeling redundant (“soundless echo of resolution,” “soundless echo of clarity”). A few phrases drift into sentimentality or near-platitude (“Each star was a promise; each revised pattern, a prayer”), softening impact. Despite this, clarity and momentum remain intact, and most imagery earns its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, with few wasted words. Some metaphors and phrases repeat or lean abstract (“history rewrote itself,” “slices through pretense,” “complementary opposites”), and there’s a mild drift toward didactic, summary-like statements in the latter half. Still, there’s little true scaffolding or muddle; the prose moves the scene forward and supports closure. With slightly less abstraction and thesis-stating, it would step into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and dense with information and image; there are few, if any, syntactic or grammatical missteps. The recurring imagery of hush, flow, and bloom is cohesive. At times the prose tilts into purple or redundant phrasing (“across the hush of a possibility just born,” “liquid metaphor for creativity’s persistent, unseen current”), and several lines paraphrase the same insight in different words. These occasional excesses slow momentum and slightly blunt the power of otherwise lovely images.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with many sentences doing double duty in advancing both mood and character. However, figurative density is very high, and certain metaphors or abstractions (“macerate the silence,” “sacred duty,” “unspoken”) recur in ways that verge on self-conscious rather than sharpening. A slight pruning of redundant formulations would increase propulsion without harming lyricism. Clarity and cadence remain intact at closure, and no metaphoric muddle disrupts the core images.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally precise, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, emotion, and theme. The figurative language stays coherent, with motifs (books, ice, light, mist) repeated in purposeful patterns. There is some redundancy and abstract phrasing in the final third (“beautiful uncertainty,” “profound connection,” “simply being present”) that slightly softens momentum and edges toward purple, but it does not blur the central action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: many sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, character) and the rhythm varies enough to sustain momentum. Images like “silver softened, flowing like liquid moonlight” and frost mirroring crystalline growth are vivid and apt. Yet figurative language is almost relentless, and some abstractions and paraphrase-like restatements near the end (“It was a masterpiece where destruction had midwifed authentic creation,” followed by moralizing lines) push into mild purple and thematic redundancy. Tighter pruning of explicit commentary would let the best images breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled, with rich but mostly purposeful imagery (“a shard of hush, solidified silence fallen from the void between creation and oblivion”) and good information density. There is some repetition of favored phrases and a slight tilt toward purple/thematic exposition in the closing paragraphs, yet it rarely muddies clarity or stalls momentum. Sentences vary in length and structure, and almost every line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. For top-tier, a bit of pruning and trusting images over explicating them would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and usually carry multiple functions (atmosphere plus character plus concept). There is some mild purple tendency—stacked modifiers and elevated abstractions (“profound beauty,” “starlit clarity,” “permanent transient”)—but they don’t obscure meaning or causality. Redundancies are limited, with only small repetitions (“resiliently positive spirit”) and a few phrases that could be tightened. Overall momentum is well maintained and the closure image lands sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally high-caliber: dense, image-rich sentences often carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without losing clarity. Lines like “a river of flowing time, thick with the scent of old paper and rain” are vivid and legible, even if they edge toward the ornate. There is some risk of purple accumulation, with metaphors stacked in close succession during peak beats, but they do not materially obscure causality or the closure image. Trimming a few abstract formulations and near-redundant intensifiers would sharpen momentum without sacrificing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft is often elegant, with high information density—many sentences do double duty in world-building and theme, and the prose generally flows cleanly. Yet there is recurrent abstraction and repetition (“horizons unfolded,” “somber marvel,” “balancedly curious understanding”) that feel like scaffolding rather than fresh image. Some phrases tilt toward purple or meta-thematic declaration instead of concrete dramatization, slightly slowing momentum in a short piece. Nonetheless, clarity is never lost, and there are several striking, specific lines that carry real weight.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong, with rich imagery (“thin as spider silk yet threaded with urgent tenderness”) and generally purposeful sentence rhythms that support mood. There is some tendency toward stacked modifiers and abstractions (“sacred tension,” “profound reeling hush,” “gentle, ongoing mending of the world”) that flirt with purple prose but do not break clarity. Most sentences do double duty—advancing atmosphere and action—without obvious scaffolding or repetition loops. The closure image is clear and not dulled by figurative muddle, though slight pruning could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are largely clean, and almost every line does multiple jobs (advancing action, deepening setting, and echoing theme). Figurative language is dense but generally coherent and purposeful, with minimal redundancy or scaffold. The piece avoids obvious loops or synonym churn, and transitions between beats (descent → chamber → activation → escape) are smooth. A few phrases approach purple (“profound peace,” “eternal rhythm”) and could be sharpened, but they don’t materially blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is strong: sentences are varied, images are mostly clear, and nearly every line does double duty for mood and meaning. A few abstractions and explicit thesis-statements feel like scaffolding rather than image (e.g., “a blueprint for resilience etched in humility”), nudging toward mild purple. Still, there’s little true redundancy or syntactic templating, and rhythm generally supports the contemplative pressure of the scene. The closure image is not muddied by figurative excess, even if the wisdom is more told than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and action) with minimal scaffold or redundancy, and syntax is clear. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent, with recurring motifs (bone, echoes, light) reinforcing rather than muddling. There is mild risk of purple prose saturation, yet it doesn’t significantly obscure causality or the closure image. Tighter pruning of a few near-duplicate phrasings (“quietly articulate,” reiterations of echoes) could sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences do multiple jobs, imagery is often striking, and there is minimal scaffolding or repetition. Some metaphors border on purple or pile up (“cathedral of roots and resilience,” “gravitationally playful pirouette,” “cosmic joke of healing”), but they remain mostly coherent and legible. Momentum is maintained through the scene; description rarely stalls the narrative. Tighter pruning of the most abstract or duplicative flourishes in the final third would sharpen the closure’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences tend to do double duty (world-building plus emotion), and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language (“vibrated down the cables into the soil like a root seeking water,” “fireflies sparked like living stars”) is largely apt and non-muddled, with good sonic rhythm when read aloud. The repeated phrase “resonantly soft” borders on over-insistence but is clearly a deliberate motif, not a verbal tic, and most modifiers earn their keep. Overall, prose has momentum and clarity, with only a slight risk of excess lushness rather than any true opacity or drag.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is polished: strong verbs, vivid images (“cobalt light pooled like liquid sapphire”), and generally high information density without much scaffolding. The prose manages a rich, lyrical register while remaining mostly clear and forward-moving. There is some tendency toward stacked abstractions and near-redundant phrases (“sacred and sorrowful,” “respectfully rebellious,” “fragile threads of connection”) that could be tightened for maximum impact. Still, no major artifacts or figurative muddles blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong sensory specificity and generally clean syntax; many lines carry atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. However, figurative density is high—“misting hush,” “whispering gleam,” “cradle of renewal,” “sacred timeframe”—and occasionally approaches purple, with some repetition of key phrases that reads more like stylistic habit than deliberate patterning. This lushness sometimes blurs edge and momentum, preventing a higher elite-venue score.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and information-dense: most lines carry setting, character, and theme simultaneously without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent, with recurring motifs of folds, geometry, and light producing a unified texture rather than purple clutter. Sentences vary in length and cadence, and transitions between present, memory, and reflection are clean. A few formulations verge on over-explicit summary, especially near the end, but they do not significantly dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is polished, with strong rhythm, vivid imagery, and generally efficient sentences that move character, setting, and mood simultaneously. Yet the density of figurative language and elevated abstractions (“luminous absence,” “resonant truth,” “cipher of longing”) becomes heavy, edging into purple and occasionally feeling redundant. Some late thematic lines restate what the images already convey, slightly dulling the closure’s sharpness. Tightening a few over-explanatory or double-phrased moments would sharpen momentum and lift this closer to elite craft.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong information density—most lines carry atmosphere, concept, and motion simultaneously. There is some tendency toward purple layering of abstractions (“hush of cosmic possibility,” “world grown weary of shadows,” “improbable longing”) that risks redundancy and slight momentum drag. Figurative language is largely consistent and non-muddled, and action sequences are easy to follow. Minor overwriting keeps it shy of the absolute top tier but does not obscure causality or blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, with figurative language that mostly clarifies rather than clutters (“iron ribs twisted like a beached leviathan’s skeleton”). There’s little to no scaffold or synonym churn; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or the ritual’s progress. A few phrases lean slightly purple (“nostalgia’s sharp perfume”), but they’re consistent with the established tone and not overstacked in high-pressure beats. The closing cadence is especially well-controlled, with images carrying weight rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically conscious, and densely informative without frequent scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Imagery is precise and largely coherent—“a fossil of potential,” “combative tenderness,” and the geometry motif create a unified figurative field. There is some risk of over-saturation in the repetition of abstract nouns (“geometry,” “resilience,” “annotation”), but it stops short of purple prose and remains legible. No major artifacts or clarity issues interfere with momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong sensory images and a clear through-line; sentences often do double duty for atmosphere and concept. However, figurative density is very high—nearly every line reaches for lush metaphors—which risks purple prose and occasionally blurs impact rather than sharpening it. There’s some conceptual redundancy (“insatiably creative” repeated; multiple variations on weaving/light/essence) that could be cut for concision. Despite this, clarity of action and closure isn’t compromised, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with image; most sentences pull double duty for atmosphere and character. Motifs of silence, weaving, and light recur with intention, and there is little outright redundancy or scaffolding. However, figurative language is nearly continuous—“whispers coiled like smoke,” “silence…thickening like settling frost,” “a living tapestry around them”—which occasionally edges toward saturation and risks numbing impact. Trimming one or two metaphors in high-intensity moments could sharpen propulsion without sacrificing the lush texture.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions, rhythm varies, and there are few if any genuine redundancies or clarity slips. Imagery like “watercolor memories” and “each stain a sentence in a language of erosion she had learned to read” is vivid and apt. That said, figurative density is high across the entire piece, and some phrases slide into conceptual abstraction or reiterate the same idea of “silence as vessel” and “shielded openness” without adding new pressure. For an elite publication, a touch more spareness and variance in register would likely be expected.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with high information density and generally purposeful metaphor; many sentences do double duty for setting, character, and theme. The ear for rhythm is strong, and there are few if any syntactic or grammatical slips. That said, some passages edge toward purple or explanatory (“This ritual translated emotion into data, seeking anchors in memory’s storm”), and the closing paragraphs contain a mild paraphrase-loop of the letting-go thesis. These issues slightly dampen propulsion and subtlety but don’t seriously obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and mostly efficient, with many lines doing double-duty for mood and concept, and relatively few genuine redundancies. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and thematically aligned; only occasionally does it edge toward purple. There are minor repetition artifacts (e.g., “tinkersong wonder” re-used, similar sentence rhythms) but they don’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. Overall line-level craft is strong, though a light trim of abstractions would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished, sensuous, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and emotion. However, figurative language is nearly constant (light, crystal, cold, clouds, navigation), edging toward purple and reducing impact via saturation. The final paragraphs repeat thematic formulations (“joy beneath anguish,” “light in the fracture, hope in the cipher”) in slightly different words, creating a mild paraphrase loop. Despite this, clarity and momentum remain intact, and most lines feel deliberate rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Some phrases, however, slide into mild purple or redundancy (“dusty starlight that dusted the heavens like powdered memory,” repeated “quietly explosive,” explicit recap lines late in the piece). Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent; only occasionally does it feel like ornament rather than pressure. Trimming a handful of summarizing or over-explicit sentences would sharpen momentum and allow the strongest images (the fallstreak hole, the final journal line) to breathe more.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple loads (setting, character, mood) and the rhythm varies effectively between long, flowing description and clipped demolition beats. Figurative language (“spiral galaxy within a nautilus shell within a fern frond’s unfurling”) is vivid and mostly precise, rarely feeling mixed or gratuitous. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and clarity of action and emotional state is maintained throughout. The density of imagery occasionally brushes against purple, especially in thematically restating lines, but it doesn’t obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, varied, and purposeful, with many doing double-duty for atmosphere and character. Phrases like “a majestic relic embodying stranded luminance both literal and metaphorical” show ambition and control, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. A few constructions lean toward ornate (“cerulean silence,” “a living tapestry of synchronized motion”), which risks slight over-richness but does not impede clarity or momentum. There are no noticeable grammatical errors or structural artifacts that blunt the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is vivid and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, emotion, and theme (e.g., the gear assortment as heartbeat and history at once). Sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid mechanical cadence, and key beats (“Ice surrendered with a sigh.” “A deep hum resonated through the hall.”) land cleanly and memorably. The density of imagery occasionally edges toward purple, with metaphor stacking (“driftwood nostalgia,” “liquid silver,” “sea-worn driftwood” vellum) that could be pared slightly without loss. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, rhythm varies, and most images do double duty for atmosphere and theme (“brambled hope,” “liquid-silver light,” “wave of visible gold”). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically consistent; it rarely lapses into mixed metaphor or clutter that obscures sense. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and crucial beats (bell revelation, nebula alignment, Elara’s farewell) are rendered concretely rather than summarized. The density of adornment occasionally edges toward lushness, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with high information density: most sentences layer setting, emotion, and concept at once (“At the lens’s heart lay the pane of hush, a disc of solidified silence that drank sound and birthed structured light.”). Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and figurative language is vivid yet mostly coherent and on-theme. There is some purple-leaning diction and minor repetition of concept-words (hush, ripple, lullaby, nested patterns), but these function as motifs rather than artifacts. Because there are no obvious loops, strained metaphors, or structural clutter to cut, only the slight richness/overornamentation at times keeps this just shy of elite line-level mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, vary in rhythm, and carry multiple jobs (world, mood, stakes) with minimal padding. Imagery—mechanical birds’ ticking wings, luminescent trails, frost on cursed branches—is vivid yet controlled, with little purple excess or metaphor muddle. Minor redundancy (“offhandedly exact precision” after an earlier very similar phrasing) and a few slightly ornamental modifiers keep it just short of exceptional, but momentum and clarity are consistently high.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.3)
    The line-level writing is generally strong, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and interiority, and there are few outright clunky constructions. However, figurative density is high and repetitive—polymers, braids, chains, bridges, and “translating separation into connection” recur in ways that sometimes feel like paraphrase loops rather than fresh turns (“The polymer of his life would be stronger for its intentional branching” is one of several near-synonymous summations). A handful of abstract, thesis-like sentences sap momentum in the final third. Trimming redundant moral statements and trusting concrete images would sharpen both propulsion and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and images that often do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once). Rhythm varies well, and line-level clarity is maintained even in figuratively rich passages. There is some risk of overwriting—frequent metaphors and abstractions (“quantified absence,” “fragile covenant,” “absolute void”) cluster, and the conceptual lexicon can feel slightly repetitive—but it doesn’t materially obscure causality or dull the closure. Tightening a few conceptual restatements would elevate the effect from lush to truly incisive.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, image-dense, and mostly efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is some piling of metaphors and elevated diction (“crystalline sorrow,” “liquid sky,” “captured starlight”) that occasionally nudges toward purple, though clarity is rarely compromised. Momentum holds across the piece: no obvious scaffolding, redundancy, or structural loops, and the climax on the coral is rendered in-scene rather than summarized. The lushness might benefit from a touch more sparseness at peak-pressure moments to heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with high information density—most sentences do dual duty for mood and worldbuilding—and few outright redundancies or scaffolding artifacts. Some metaphor clusters risk excess (“weaving isolated threads of community into a resilient tapestry,” “vigorous tender chaos,” repeated “borrowed starlight”), nudging the piece toward mild overwriting. Still, cause-and-effect remains clear, temporal progression is easy to follow, and there are no syntactic confusions or copy errors. Tightening a handful of near-duplicate thematic phrases and trimming one or two ornate modifiers would raise the work to a sleeker, magazine-ready polish.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong metaphors (“moon, a sliver of polished bone”) and good information density. However, figurative language and abstract phrasing are nearly constant, creating a mild sense of purple over-saturation and reducing the impact of peak images. Certain concepts and words (“helix-minded,” “modify,” “profound transformation”) recur in near-identical registers, producing subtle paraphrase loops rather than fresh turns. Despite this, clarity and momentum remain intact, and key beats are legible and rhythmically controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush but mostly disciplined: many sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) and the imagery is coherent with few mixed metaphors. Information density is high with clear sequencing, so momentum rarely stalls despite the lyricism. There is some risk of purple prose and redundant intensifiers (“spectral shroud,” “clandestinely luminous glow,” repeated blaze metaphors) that could be pared for sharper impact. Still, line-level craft is above average and closure remains crisp and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and often beautiful, with strong images like “a complex cartography of stress cracks mapped its surface like a sorrowful score.” Information density is high: most sentences do more than one job, advancing atmosphere and character at once. However, metaphor and abstraction are frequent (“empathy in motion,” “symponically minded perception”), nudging toward overwriting in places and creating a slightly uniform lushness. Momentum remains clear and un-obscured, but some tightening of figurative language would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong information density and purposeful imagery (e.g., “the dent in the stone was not weakness; it was devotion carved by pressure”). There is some overwriting and abstraction—stacked metaphors, repeated shadow/light formulations, and thesis-like sentences—which slightly dull momentum and edge toward purple in the final third. A stray “[8” artifact near the end also breaks polish. Tightening a few redundant or expository lines would lift this to elite line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished, with high information density and strong rhythmic control; most sentences do at least two jobs (world, mood, and character) simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and thematically aligned, and I didn’t spot outright mixed metaphors or confusing constructions. There is some risk of purple prose and repetition around key terms (“silence,” “resonant,” “path to empathy”), which slightly softens impact rather than sharpening it. Nonetheless, momentum holds, and the closure image is crisp and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level writing is generally strong, with good information density and a smooth rhythmic flow; nearly every sentence does character or atmosphere work. Some repetition of key abstractions (“serenity within motion,” “wildflower hush,” “undercurrent of wisdom”) edges toward thematic overstatement rather than fresh image-making. Diction is mostly precise and concrete, though occasional register bumps (“olfactorily,” “journalize”) jar mildly against the otherwise natural style. There are no major artifacts or clarity issues, but the piece stops short of the sharpest, most economical lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, good rhythm, and high information density—most lines do double duty for image and concept. Figurative language is rich yet largely coherent with the established physics and tone, and I see no major paraphrase loops or template cadences. A few phrases veer toward purple or abstract (“hope took root—accelerated by understanding, nurtured by silence”), but they don’t significantly muddy clarity or dull the final image. Line-level control is easily at a competitive-publication tier, if just shy of the most razor-cut minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally do multiple jobs (advancing plot, character, and atmosphere at once). Imagery is sharp and mostly well-calibrated to the moment, with only occasional hints of purple (“shadows stretching like liquid mercury”) that don’t significantly impair clarity. There are no evident loops, scaffolding, or confusing metaphors, and the rhythm carries momentum through a largely reflective piece. This is high-grade prose that could run with minimal line edits.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting and theme. The figurative language—“sculpted hush,” “crystalline cerulean blue,” “a lullaby for the mountain”—is rich and mostly coherent, with few if any mixed metaphors. There is some repetition of similar lofty constructions and imagery (starlight, light-as-music, cathedral-like ice) that edges toward overwriting but does not significantly slow momentum or obscure cause/effect. Pacing through the climax and into the closing cadence is smooth, and the final line ties motifs together cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: syntax varies, images are concrete, and most lines do multiple jobs (advancing ritual, world, and emotion together). However, the prose leans heavily on figurative and abstract phrasing—“cosmic weave,” “sonic architecture,” “avalanchingly quiet”—with some repetition (“avalanchingly quiet” appears twice) and mild density bloat. A few insights are told rather than embodied, creating moments of conceptual overstatement that slightly blunt the otherwise fine rhythm and clarity. Still, momentum is maintained and there are no major artifacts or confusions.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and economical for its density: most sentences carry multiple loads (world-building, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Imagery is largely coherent and non-generic, and cadence varies enough to avoid monotony while sustaining a lyrical register. There is some risk of over-saturation in abstract nouns and thesis-like statements in the final third, but clarity at the climax and closure remains intact. No major line-level artifacts or loops dull momentum or obscure cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong: vivid images, good sentence variety, and a clear forward pulse with almost no true dead lines. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (light, vibration, seeds), and action ordering is easy to follow. There is a slight tendency toward purple abstraction and reiterative phrasing in the closing paragraphs, which blunts impact and could be tightened at a top-market level. Minor bracket artifacts (“[290”, “[468”) are visually jarring but do not meaningfully obstruct sense.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and image-rich, with strong information density—nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Recurring motifs (prism, frost, mist, arbor) are handled with purposeful variation rather than redundant looping. Some lines flirt with purple or thematic overtness, but clarity never suffers, and there are no noticeable scaffold sentences or mechanical cadences weighing the piece down.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing atmospheric and emotional work simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme (threads, tapestry, borders), contributing to a unified texture. There is some tendency toward repetition and purple edges—stacked modifiers and recurring formulations that could be trimmed for greater impact. Momentum is maintained despite the lyricism; no major loops or artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and mostly efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and story. Imagery is clear and rarely muddled, and there are no glaring grammatical or syntactic issues. That said, there is noticeable repetition of key terms and concepts (“resilience,” “rubble,” “azure,” “quiet determination”) and a tendency toward uniformly lush phrasing that occasionally borders on purple. Trimming a few near-duplicate emotional statements would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, varied in rhythm, and information-dense, with most lines doing double-duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Images are clear and rarely over-written; metaphor chains like “skeletal ships… like forgotten prayers” land cleanly. There is some lexical repetition around “resonance,” “weight,” and “purpose,” and a few abstract summaries could be trimmed, but they do not materially blunt momentum or the closing image. No major artifacts, loops, or syntactic monotony interfere with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence craft is generally high, with strong imagery (“moonlight bled through the colossal Fresnel lens…”) and good information density, and almost every line does emotional or atmospheric work. However, figurative language is very dense, with frequent elaborate metaphors (“bottled the feeling of safety,” “luminescent ache”) that occasionally edge into purple and feel reiterative. A few conceptual redundancies—restating the legacy/safety idea in similar terms—slightly drag momentum. These issues modestly limit the piece under a top-tier editorial standard.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and motive) with minimal redundancy, and rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. Figurative language is frequent but largely apt and coherent; images like “waves unclenched their white fists” and “etched with faint, fading impressions of the shadow-glyphs” are vivid and legible. There’s occasional flirtation with lushness (“infinite velvet sky,” “shadowed elation”) but it doesn’t obscure cause/effect or closure. No noticeable loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean despite their lyricism, and images like “a shard of fallen sky” or dust motes and spiderwebs in the sunbeam do multiple jobs at once. The prose maintains clarity even in its densest figurative moments, and information rarely feels repeated as scaffold. There is a mild tendency toward stacked abstractions in the final third (“chromatic truth both fleeting and eternal,” “quiet explosion of empathy”) that verge on purple but don’t quite obscure sense. Rhythm and paragraphing support the gradual, ritualistic pacing effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, and character) with good rhythm and few, if any, mechanical errors. Imagery is often striking and coherent (“trees…not passive witnesses but compassionate archivists”), and the prose has a consistent musicality that suits the material. There is some risk of over-density—stacked modifiers and recurrent grand abstractions near the end flirt with purple prose and reduce impact slightly. Trimming a few explicit thematic phrases would sharpen momentum and let the already-powerful images breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with many sentences performing double duty (worldbuilding plus emotional state) and a strong rhythmic sense. Imagery is generally precise and legible (“dewdrop, formed of condensed song and starlight”) and avoids mixed metaphors despite the density. However, the line-level sometimes veers toward purple—metaphorical stacks like “shattered loom,” “luminous threads,” “tapestry of light,” “sacred loom” cluster heavily—creating a mild sense of saturation that slightly slows momentum. There is little redundant scaffolding, and causality/closure remain clear despite the ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are generally clear, rhythmically varied, and purposeful, with strong control of imagery and little scaffolding. Many lines do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and interior state (“The library itself seemed to breathe with her, shelves leaning inward like guardians holding their breath”). There is mild repetition of key phrases and some abstract, slogan-like constructions in the final third, which slightly dull momentum and subtlety. Overall, though, there are no serious artifacts or confusion, and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are rhythmic, sensory, and purposeful, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. The bread and gardening images carry multiple functions (setting, memory, theme) without feeling cluttered. There is some drift into near-purple abstraction and reiterative thematic phrasing in the final third, which slightly blurs the sharpness of the closing images. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and most lines earn their place.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with few redundancies and a clear forward momentum despite the contemplative mode. The figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (quartz hush, mathematical elegy, midwifed meaning), avoiding mixed metaphors or serious muddle. There are minor purple notes and repeated constructions (e.g., “gently meticulous,” repeated “as long as…” structure) that edge toward over-insistence, but they don’t significantly drag clarity or cadence. The closing cadence (“For as long as light lingered in glass…”) is particularly well-shaped and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and action. Sensory specificity (sea glass shattering, whiskey-scented air, blue dye on a cuff) strengthens the line-level work and supports plot beats. There is some mild repetition of key phrases and a few explanatory/theme-summary sentences near the end that could be pared back for greater impact. No serious artifacts, loops, or figurative muddle interfere with momentum or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are generally crisp, rhythmically varied, and dense with sensory and conceptual information that does multiple jobs at once. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, with “terrestrially cosmic” and the taste-mapping of direction standing out as strong, unifying devices. There is a slight tendency toward abstraction and repetition of key formulations (“terrestrially cosmic,” explicit thematic restatements) that edges into mild overwriting but doesn’t obscure clarity or momentum. No obvious scaffolding, loops, or mechanical cadences interfere with the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is polished and generally clear, with strong sensory nouns and verbs and a good sense of cadence. However, the prose frequently tips into purple, with stacked modifiers and repeated metaphors (“auroral,” “sorrowful light,” “shattered completely,” etc.) that sometimes restate rather than deepen. Several sentences perform thematic explanation where image alone would suffice, slightly dragging momentum. Despite this, cause/effect remains legible and the closing image is not obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and generally spare despite its lyricism; most lines carry two or three jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without feeling bloated. Imagery is strong and coherent—the recurring water/plant/gold motifs rarely mix metaphors or strain logic. There are a few lines that lean toward aphorism or thematic sloganing, which slightly dulls the sharpness of the final cadence, but they don’t create confusion or loops. Sentence rhythm and paragraphing support momentum well for a reflective, accumulative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length, imagery is mostly precise, and most lines do double duty advancing both mood and information. There is some purple density and conceptual echo (“symphonies of truth,” “color of wonder,” “endless poem”) that edges toward redundancy, but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or closure. Momentum remains acceptable for a lyric piece; no major scaffolding or obvious loops. The final image (dull shard, steadfast heart, enduring silence) is clear and well-framed.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: clear, varied sentences; precise images; and minimal scaffolding or redundancy, with each beat advancing atmosphere and emotional state. Figurative language is controlled and usually apt (“thick trunks storing memories of rare rains,” “ductile” fear objects, the sap lens), and the prose reads cleanly aloud. There are a few explanatory or label-like lines that momentarily slow momentum or repeat concepts (“This was the action of miniaturize…”, multiple “This was…” thematic tags), keeping it just under exemplary. Still, there are no serious artifacts or muddle, and information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and musical, with varied sentence structures and vivid but generally controlled figurative language. Some descriptions edge toward lush repetition (multiple restatements of listening as healing and story as tapestry) yet they don’t significantly stall momentum. Information density is high: almost every sentence advances atmosphere, theme, or plot. A touch of abstraction and thematic reiteration in the final third keeps it just shy of top-tier concision.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong cadence and generally efficient sentences that do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition loops. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and tonally apt—the spider/web, loom, and dance motifs interlock rather than collide. There is mild purple-glow in a few abstractions ("calm defiance was her legacy," "quiet triumph of intention") that slightly flatten specificity, but they don’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. Syntax and punctuation are clean, and the closing images land clearly despite the density.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs at once (setting, mood, and character) with few redundancies or scaffolding. The prose has a distinct cadence and good variation in structure, and key beats (“tears traced clean paths through the salt dust”) are vivid and precise. There is some purple stacking of modifiers and motifs (“profound, gleaming silence”; repeated “glowing with inner fire”) that feels slightly overdecorated. Still, these do not materially obscure sense or closure, so the piece remains polished and nearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are musical, image-dense, and precise enough to maintain clarity despite the lyricism. The ritual action flows in an understandable sequence, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. However, figurative language is nearly constant—“terrestrially cosmic harmony,” “thin as a promise,” “smoothed hush”—which occasionally edges toward purple and could be pruned for greater impact. Minor redundancy in phrasing and intensity slightly blunts propulsion but does not seriously obscure cause or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmic, precise, and generally high in information density, with pleasing motifs (steam, keys, stone, sugar) woven without obvious scaffolding. There is some repetition of phrases (“patiently nimble,” “interrogate stone”) and a few slightly on-the-nose or purple constructions, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or obscure sense. Syntax varies well, and most lines do multiple jobs (setting, emotion, and theme at once). Minor tightening for redundancy would raise this to a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, and thematic hinting) with few redundancies, and rhythm is pleasingly varied. There is some repetition of concepts and modifiers (“tragically radiant,” “ghostly resolve”) and occasional explanatory lines that tell what the images already imply, edging into mild overwriting. Figurative language is generally coherent and apt, and no metaphor muddles sense or obscures the closure image. Momentum holds despite the lyric density, but a very rigorous editor would likely trim a small amount of abstract restatement.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, image-rich, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; almost every sentence does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). Motifs like dripping, light, and stone recur with clear intentionality rather than mechanical repetition. The density of metaphor edges toward purple in places but remains coherent and legible, without mixed images or rhythm-breaking clutter. A slightly tighter pass on a few abstract or reiterated formulations would move this closer to publish-now perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is generally strong: varied sentence structures, high information density, and vivid, concrete images that usually do more than one job at once (e.g., the shell’s heat signaling both magic and rising stakes). The prose sustains a high-lyric register with relatively few mixed or strained metaphors, and momentum rarely stalls despite descriptive density. There are moments of near-purple stacking (“tapestry of cold, watchful stars,” “melody of reed-blown melancholy”) and some conceptual repetition that could be tightened. Still, these are minor frictions; clarity and cadence are preserved through the climax and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding. Imagery is largely fresh and coherent, with recurring motifs (ice, candles, starlight, snow globe) reinforcing one another instead of competing. There is some tendency toward lushness and near-repetition of thematic language in the final third, skirting sentimentality but not tipping into muddle. Line-level clarity and momentum remain intact through the closing beat, allowing the final images to land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is frequently beautiful, dense with multi-tasking images that build atmosphere and theme (emerald foam as “miniature galaxies,” knots like stars, dripping parapet as “liquid affirmation”). Line-level clarity is maintained despite the lyricism, and there are few outright muddled metaphors. However, the frequency of high-register abstractions and thesis-like sentences, plus some repetition (“scintillatingly somber beauty,” restating what the whistle “was”), reads as mild overwriting that slightly blunts impact. Trimming a few explicit thematic statements and stacked modifiers would sharpen momentum and let the strongest images breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, information-dense, and usually do double duty for atmosphere and character without bloat. The opening image and closing cadence are both well-honed, with minimal scaffold or redundancy. There is some repetition of abstract phrasing (“comfortable lies,” “stillpoint” as philosophical principle) and a tendency toward explicit summary in the final third, but not enough to drag momentum. Figurative language is controlled and coherent; no mixed metaphors or obvious cadence templates intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, with recurring motifs (shadows, static, ocean of clouds) rather than scattershot similes. A few phrases (“news spread like gentle tide, eroding Kael’s doctrine,” “gritty whimsy lived in this truth”) flirt with purple or expository abstraction, slightly dulling momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained throughout, and the final image lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. The recurring images of jars, sound, and light are well-handled without major figurative muddle. That said, the piece verges on purple at times, stacking abstractions (“gleaned redemption,” “captured grace,” “lonesome splendor”) and repeating similar tonal notes, which slightly blunts impact. A bit more spareness or contrast would sharpen the strongest sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, musical, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors and sensory details are vivid and usually coherent, and there is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping that would bog the prose. The density of figurative language is high, sometimes flirting with purple (“molten amber and rose,” “liquid silver,” “forgiveness of sound”), but it remains legible and rarely obscures action or causality. Minor redundancy around the definition of “sonic absolution” is the main place where tightening would benefit momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush but mostly efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (e.g., impatience as a “trapped bird” and the lake as an “obsidian mirror”). Rhythm varies nicely between long, incantatory lines and shorter emphatic beats like the single crack across the lake. There is some conceptual redundancy around patience/impatience and “patient revolution,” edging toward thematic repetition, but it doesn’t seriously bog momentum or obscure action. Figurative language is generally controlled and unmuddied, avoiding mixed metaphors in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is clean, with strong, specific images (“the scent of wet concrete, rust, and the ghost of desperation”) and mostly efficient sentences that each add atmosphere or information. There is some conceptual and lexical repetition (“preventable death,” “controlling influence,” “fortified vulnerability”) and a tendency toward abstract formulations and thematic slogans in the final third. Figurative language remains coherent and doesn’t cloud action, but a few sentences feel like scaffold or paraphrase of what’s already implied. Overall momentum holds, yet tighter pruning of moralizing phrases would sharpen the close.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence lengths, mostly precise diction, and a high information density where images often work on both literal and symbolic levels. There is some purple shading (“divine precision,” “like silent prayers”) but it remains controlled and pattern-consistent rather than florid clutter. Minimal redundancy or scaffold is visible, and causality remains clear despite the lyricism. A touch more restraint in the closing thematic sentences could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, rhythmic, and information-dense: most sentences perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and thematic charge at once). Some metaphor stacking ("bubbling acid sea," "furious green beast," "skeletal remains," etc.) veers toward purple, but it doesn’t significantly obscure action or closure. There is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the piece largely avoids explaining what it has already dramatized. Overall readability and momentum remain strong despite the high decorative load.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally tight, with high information density—most sentences advance both world and character, and metaphor is controlled (“digital echoes,” “keeper of echoes”). Rhythm is varied and readable, and there are no major clarity issues or syntactic artifacts. A few phrases veer toward the purple or redundant (“sacred spaces,” “living tapestry of protected secrets,” repeated “brightly attentive”), slightly softening impact. These remain minor blemishes rather than structural problems, leaving the closure image clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are largely clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Imagery is mostly precise and controlled, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyric bent. There is some nearing of purple—clusters like “shadow-laced…soft, living shadows that shifted like smoke,” “restoration of context over clarity,” “courageous anomaly”—but they don’t obscure causality or closure. Tightening a few conceptual phrases and trimming one or two overlapping descriptors would elevate it further to top-tier minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant and information-dense, with varied syntax and strong concrete imagery; lines often carry multiple jobs (setting, emotion, and theme at once). There is some repetition of favored phrases and a tendency toward stacked lyricism (“windborne solace,” “gentle horizon under star-dusted sky,” “survival’s symphony”) that grazes purple without crossing into true muddle. Momentum holds, and clarity is never in doubt. A slight trim of explicit abstractions and a firmer check on near-duplicate insights would refine this to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is polished, with high information density and images that generally do multiple jobs (setting, emotion, and theme at once). There is some risk of purple or overworked metaphor (“liquid honey,” “gentle bridge,” “sacred geometry”) and abstract nouns, but clarity remains intact and sentences don’t stall momentum. Repetition is purposeful rather than looped scaffolding, and syntax varies enough to avoid a mechanical cadence. Trimming a few of the more overtly conceptual phrases would lift the prose into a leaner, more quietly powerful register.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is generally tight and musical, with most lines doing double duty (advancing ritual, world, and theme). Figurative language is frequent but coherent, and it rarely muddies sense or causality. There is some conceptual redundancy around the periphery/center contrast and the nature of the clearing that could be pruned without loss. Still, there are no glaring loops or artifacts, and the closure image reads clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally graceful, with pleasing rhythm and a good density of image; phrases like “silver arcs caught dawn and dusk light like threads of starlight” are effective. There is some tendency toward abstraction and purple phrasing (“alchemically transmute the town’s collective pain,” “masterpiece of shared understanding”) that feels slightly over-wrought for the emotional temperature. Repetition of certain constructions and motifs edges toward redundancy but doesn’t significantly hinder clarity or momentum. Line-level craft is clearly above-average but not yet razor-honed for maximum economy and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, mostly free of redundancy, and often do double duty in advancing mood and meaning (“hanging like a frozen constellation” both grounds and resonates thematically). Figurative language is present but not piled so thickly that it muddies clarity, and the progression from concrete description to more abstract insight feels earned. There are a handful of near-platitudinous constructions and parallelisms that could be tightened, but no real loops, mixed metaphors, or artifacts that dull the closure image. Read-aloud rhythm and paragraphing support the quiet escalation effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, images are generally coherent, and most lines do at least two jobs (world-building plus emotion, or action plus theme). However, figurative density is very high—“tidal longing,” “magnetic silence,” “condensed sorrow,” etc.—and the repetition of certain conceptual nouns (“echo,” “longing”) risks slight saturation. A bit of pruning could sharpen impact and pace, which keeps this from the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with rich metaphors and good rhythmic variation; many sentences perform multiple functions (setting, mood, and character all at once). There is some density of figurative language and abstraction (“covenant,” “cosmic indifference,” “mechanical vertigo,” “luminous ache”) that risks purple patches and could be tightened for greater sharpness. Still, causality and imagery remain clear, and there are few, if any, true loops or scaffolding lines. The closure image reads cleanly and is not muddied by metaphor overload.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and rich with sensory detail; many sentences do double duty for image and emotion. However, metaphor density is high—“liquid gold,” “pulsing stillness,” “silent rivers,” “scent of hope”—pushing the line toward purple and occasionally feeling redundant. Despite this, clarity is never lost and the closure image is clean. A lighter touch on figurative language in a few spots would raise it to truly top-tier line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, coherent, and carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and action) without obvious scaffold or loops. The figurative language is occasionally lush but mostly controlled, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. A few phrases flirt with purple (“echo of revelation,” “nebula-strewn void”) yet do not obscure meaning or causality. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready with only minor opportunities to tighten or sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and loaded with more than one function (world, character, theme). However, motifs and phrasing repeat with little added pressure—“constellations,” “shrewd innocence,” and bone-setting as metaphor are reiterated in ways that feel like paraphrase loops rather than escalation. Several late sentences summarize her mission in abstract, thesis-like terms that slow momentum and could be cut or sharpened. It’s polished but somewhat overwritten, reducing the impact of the otherwise lovely images.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory images and generally efficient sentences that carry multiple layers (setting, emotion, theme). However, there is some accumulation of near-synonymous expressions and echoing constructions ("born of," "bloom," "quiet certainty," "gentle transformation") that verge on purple and slightly slow momentum. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and thematically aligned. Tightening a few redundant modifiers and repeated conceptual frames would elevate line-level impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, dense with purposeful imagery and sensory detail; the read-aloud rhythm largely works and the closure image is clear. There is some overwriting—frequent metaphor stacking, repeated formulations (“honeyed hush,” “graft new meaning”) and a few near-paraphrase sentences about transforming regret and passivity—that could be trimmed for sharpness. Nonetheless, most lines do more than one job (atmosphere + theme + character), and syntax remains legible without muddling causality. The lyrical mode is well sustained, if occasionally heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong images and generally clean syntax. However, there’s some repetitiveness in phrasing and concept (“Lucidly watchful” twice; several near-synonymous restatements of his “method” and “inside the whisper of closing pages”), approaching mild paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent, with only occasional edges of purple. Information density is solid and momentum adequate for lyric mode, even if the rhythm is somewhat uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and densely packed with sensory and thematic work. Figurative language (“dawn bled softly,” “filament of liquid gold”) is often striking and coherent. However, nearly every sentence carries an image or modifier, so the cumulative effect verges on purple and slightly dulls momentum in what should be the most pressurized moments. There are no serious loops or scaffolding artifacts, but a leaner line occasionally would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and generally high-density: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Syntax varies nicely, and rhythm supports the sense of ritual and slow tension, especially around the blood-drop and starlight descent. Occasional clusters of ornate modifiers (“vibrant, impossible bloom,” “luminous cartography,” “moving stillness”) edge toward purple but do not significantly obscure clarity or causality. Line-level tightening—trimming a few near-synonymous intensifiers—could further sharpen impact for elite placement.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally free of redundancy or scaffolding. Imagery (light, marble, echoes, liquid starlight) is vivid and mostly well-controlled, with multi-tasking lines that carry setting, theme, and character. There is a slight tendency toward lushness and repeated abstract phrases (“wounded season,” “cellar of reason”) that flirt with purple but don’t obscure clarity. Overall momentum remains intact despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and high information density; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent with the world. A few phrases edge toward decorative abstraction ("boundary-lessly trapped anxiety") and there’s mild modifier stacking, but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or drag momentum. The final image is clean and unblurred by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level writing is strong, with high information density and many sentences doing double duty for scene, character, and theme (“This shaving held the lesson of tenderness, harvested from quiet vulnerability.”). Sensory detail is precise, metaphors are generally apt, and rhythm avoids mechanical patterns. There is some repetition of key words and concepts (“harvest,” “lesson,” “here and gone,” “contain”) that flirts with over-insistence, and a few phrases verge on purple or didactic. Still, clarity and momentum are preserved, and no major artifacts dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“islands of solidified emotion—joy like amber, sorrow like polished obsidian”). There is some risk of purple prose and abstraction, especially in phrases like “integrated time” and “compassionate understanding,” which slightly dilute immediacy. Still, clarity holds, scaffolding is minimal, and the line-level rhythm supports the contemplative pace. A small trim of conceptual nouns would likely elevate it to truly elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, character, theme) and the rhythm is varied and readable. Yet the prose regularly borders on purple, with dense figurative language and repeated conceptual motifs (“redirected flows,” “functionally creative,” “equation for hope”) that can feel more self-conscious than necessary. Some sentences echo each other conceptually without adding new pressure, creating mild redundancy. Still, clarity and momentum hold, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with good rhythm and high information density—most sentences advance both scene and emotion. Sensory detail is lush and often precise, particularly around smell, light, and texture. That said, there are a few clear redundancies and over-intensifications (“petrichor” repeated in one sentence, “excruciatingly gently” reused, multiple heavy modifiers stacked) that tip into overwriting and could be cut for greater sharpness. These issues don’t obscure meaning but do modestly blunt momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“sky bleeding from amber to deep indigo,” “cathedral of deceit”) and generally efficient sentences that carry both atmosphere and character. There are some paraphrase-like echoes and abstraction clusters in the final third (reiterating “salvage,” “clarity,” “truth”) that slightly dull momentum and freshness. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, avoiding serious mixed-metaphor confusion. The line-level craft is strong and near-publishable, though a tough editor would trim a few redundant conceptual phrases to sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, precise images (“snow glittering like scattered promises,” “a twisted root of smoky glass”) and a good balance of sentence lengths create momentum within a calm scene. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, rarely tipping into purple. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or mechanical cadences that dull the effect. A slight density of metaphor in places is the only minor risk area, but it doesn’t harm clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: vivid images, purposeful diction, and most sentences doing double-duty for mood and meaning. There is some tendency toward density of metaphor and elevated phrasing (“salt-thick twilight,” “sacred geography,” “lonesome splendor”) that occasionally edges into purple but remains coherent. Repetitions around “map,” “geography,” and “holy spaces” begin to feel slightly redundant at the end, where trimming could heighten impact. Rhythm and clarity, including at closure, remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and generally efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information (“Light painted ephemeral forests on the walls; a resonant hum vibrated deep within the bones of the palace”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and internally consistent; it supports the lyric mode rather than obscuring sense. There are minor tendencies toward redundancy and explicit telling at the end (e.g., restating the thematic insight) and a few near-purple turns, yet momentum and clarity never collapse. Tightening a handful of explanatory lines would bring the piece closer to elite-line precision.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and packed with information, and most metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned. The prose mostly avoids redundancy, with each step of the ritual introducing a new layer of meaning rather than restating the same point. There is some risk of purple prose and abstraction (“tapestry of her unyielding compassion,” “living truth”), which slightly softens impact and momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is preserved, and the closing images land without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and images that often do double duty (e.g., geese as both time marker and constellation mirror). Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and most metaphors are coherent and grounded in the story’s sky/water/stone palette. There are a couple of noticeable artifacts—“unstick ed,” “unstick ing”—and some formulaic repetition of highlighted terms that slightly dulls the finish at an elite-publication standard. Trimming a few near-duplicate thematic formulations in the final third would further sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Repeated phrases and images (“quiet sigh of falling petals,” approximation of infinity) largely read as intentional motif rather than scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and legible; it rarely muddies cause/effect or the closure image. A slight uniformity of lushness and occasional near-redundant sentiments prevent it from reaching the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, varied in syntax, and often carries multiple loads (image, emotion, and theme) in a single sentence; lines like “thundering calm” and “silent majesty” are memorable. Information density is high without major repetition or scaffolding, and action/order remain clear despite lyricism. The main constraint at this level is a mild tendency toward over-saturation of figurative language and elevated modifiers, which occasionally risks purple prose without quite tipping into muddle. Tightening a few stacked metaphors or adjective clusters would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. There is some overreliance on thematic vocabulary (“balance,” “absolution,” “ethically diligent”) and a few concept-heavy lines that feel slightly didactic or redundant with surrounding images. Figurative language is mostly controlled and grounded (e.g., obsidian pools mirroring the tower’s shadow), with no major mixed metaphors. Momentum holds for a lyric piece, though trimming a couple of explicit thematic restatements would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with figurative language that usually clarifies rather than obscures. Phrases like “velveteen gloom,” “tenderly organized,” and the color-coded threads are memorable without collapsing meaning. There is some risk of purple prose and repetition of key modifiers, and a few lines tip into explanatory abstraction (“a compass for her gardening and her soul”) rather than trusting image alone. Still, rhythm, clarity, and economy are good enough that these issues feel like polish tweaks, not structural debts.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong imagery (“shard of solidified night,” “ice-core whispers”) and generally efficient sentences that carry both worldbuilding and theme. There is some density drift toward purple and redundancy—phrases like “threshold of pure potential” and reiterations of “grounded imagination” and “sustaining transformation” feel slightly ornamental. Nonetheless, syntax is varied, pacing is controlled, and there are no real clarity issues or figurative muddles that undercut the ending. A judicious tightening of abstractions would move this closer to elite-level line work.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and image-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“her pen a needle stitching silence back into song”). Metaphoric language is generally precise and coherent, though the accumulation borders on purple in places and leaves little negative space. Line-level clarity and momentum remain intact; sentences vary in length and structure with purposeful rhythm. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffold, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and often do multiple jobs at once (advancing action, mood, and theme). Recurring phrases like “somber marvel,” “quiet resonance,” and repeated formulations of “truth” and “crystallization” veer toward redundancy and mild purple prose. Still, the imagery (porcelain dust like snow, chair as heartbeat) is coherent and the closure image is vivid and legible. Trimming some abstract commentary would sharpen momentum without harming the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and dense with information, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and character. Recurring phrases like “abrasive calm” and the cog motif feel intentional rather than repetitive scaffolding. There is minor conceptual redundancy in the closing third (restating his role and philosophy in slightly different abstractions), which trims momentum a bit. Figurative language stays coherent and controlled, with no purple excess that obscures sense.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and musical, with varied sentence rhythms and strong sensory density. Repeated motifs ("velvet," "stillness," "subtracted noise") function as pattern, not artifact, and there’s little in the way of scaffolding or synonym churn. A few moments lean toward purple or over-explicit metaphor, but they don’t obscure clarity or dull the closure image. Overall, information density is high and most sentences carry multiple layers (setting, emotion, theme) efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong: vivid images, efficient sentences, and good rhythmic variation with few true redundancies. Taste-based metaphors (“tart joy,” “metallic salt of a gardener’s tears”) are specific and apt, doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Some lines lapse into abstract or platitudinous formulation (“This was wisdom earned not in halls of learning, but in the quiet honesty of dirt and decay”), slightly dulling momentum and freshness. Overall clarity and propulsion remain high, with only occasional overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally elegant, with high information density—many sentences carry setting, mood, and theme at once. There is some risk of purple prose in stacked metaphors (“liquid gold and deep violet shadows,” “diamond dust”), but coherence is maintained and the imagery is internally consistent. Repetition of certain words/gestures (“reverent,” “legacy, not a log”) flirts with redundancy but doesn’t meaningfully slow momentum or cloud the closure. The prose would be competitive in many literary venues, though a slight trim of intensifiers and self-conscious phrasing could sharpen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally high: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, and thematic work), and rhythm varies effectively. Some figurative density and repetition ("quiet blaze," "hush," reiterated explanations of displaced objects) risk mild overwriting, though clarity remains intact. There are very few scaffold or loop sentences that restate without adding pressure. The prose is polished and publication-ready with minor trims, rather than razor-honed at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, with rich imagery and good information density—many lines advance both atmosphere and theme simultaneously. However, modifiers and abstractions accumulate (“profound duality,” “beautiful complexity,” “hard-won wisdom”), and certain constructions recur, giving a faint sense of purple repetition. Several sentences rephrase the same thematic point with minor variation, which slightly drags momentum in what is otherwise a compact piece. Despite this, clarity of action and closure image remains strong, and there are no serious syntactic or logical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied rhythms, dense information, and vivid imagery that typically does more than one job (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) at once. There is some tendency toward repetition and near-paraphrase, especially in the closing paragraphs where ideas about confinement, beauty-in-brokenness, and acceptance are stated in multiple adjacent lines. The prose occasionally edges into purple or expository when a lighter touch would suffice, but clarity and momentum remain intact. No significant metaphoric muddle or syntactic artifacts interfere with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is mostly apt and non-muddled, e.g., “pigment the color of quiet hope” and “saffron quiet of the greenhouse.” There is some repetition of favorite constructions and a mild purple tendency, but it does not obscure meaning or dull the closure. The prose is strong and ready for publication with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, character) and maintain momentum, with few wasted or redundant lines. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically grounded (thaw, stone memory, rosewater dread, protective hymn), and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. There is some mild purple edging—occasional clusters of abstractions like “profound warmth” and “loving preservation”—but they don’t significantly obscure clarity or dull the closure. With slightly more restraint in the most explicitly “big statement” lines, this could edge higher.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is high: syntax is clean, metaphors are mostly apt, and nearly every sentence carries sensory or conceptual weight. However, figurative density is extreme—metaphors and abstractions stack line after line (“bruised twilight sky,” “quiet desperation,” “bleak exhilaration”) and sometimes risk numbing impact. There is minor conceptual redundancy around the same emotional notes (defiance, possibility, time as design) without fresh facet each time. Strong, clear prose overall, but a demanding editor would want selective trimming for maximum sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, dense with meaning, and most images do double duty for atmosphere and theme. A few spots veer toward purple or stacked modifiers (e.g., “repulsive allure of decay—sweet rot from spilled candy apples warring with the metallic tang of old blood”), but clarity remains intact and momentum doesn’t significantly stall. There is little obvious scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances mood, world, or conflict. Tightening a handful of overloaded phrases and trimming one or two explicit thematic restatements would elevate this to truly elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong: high information density, clear sequencing, and vivid imagery that advances both atmosphere and concept. There is some mild repetition and formulaic phrasing around “fractal generating” that reads more like prompt compliance than natural metaphor. Nonetheless, sentences mostly avoid loops or padding, and the closure image is clean and undulled by purple excess. Line-level craft is publish-ready with only small refinements needed for maximum polish.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences are varied, images are clear, and most figurative language earns its keep while doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding + theme + mood). Information density is high without serious opacity, and there’s little true scaffolding or synonym-churn. A few spots verge on purple or repetitive in motif (“pattern language,” “sunwashed dread”), which slightly dulls their impact by the end. Nonetheless, the prose maintains momentum and clarity through the climax and closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are well-shaped, imagery is clear, and there is good information density with few genuine redundancies. Some phrasing circles the same idea ("noble lie," "rescued truth," "recapture") in near-synonym loops, and a few metaphors are explained rather than left to resonate, which slightly dulls momentum. Nonetheless, the prose remains lucid and musical, with no artifacts that obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, figurative density is high and occasionally borders on purple or redundant, especially with repeated metaphors around tapestry, blaze, and thresholds. A few lines simply restate prior insights in elevated language, lightly dragging momentum. Despite this, clarity remains intact and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant and well-controlled, with high information density: many sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and character sensibility simultaneously. However, there is a noticeable tendency toward over-saturation of figurative language and repeated phrasal motifs (“reclaimed stillness,” “dappled”), which edges into purple in places and could be tightened for greater impact. Line-level clarity remains solid; actions are easy to follow and the closure image is crisp. Trimming a few modifiers and slightly varying metaphor texture would elevate the piece into a more rarefied band.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) and rhythm is varied enough to avoid mechanical patterns. The metaphoric texture is rich, and many images (“woven from light and longing,” “luminous monuments to a folded sorrow”) earn their place. However, there is some overwriting and explanatory echo where the text names what the images already show, and ascent/descent/the-transformation are occasionally re-stated rather than allowed to resonate. This mild purple tendency trims momentum but does not seriously obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is largely polished, with strong rhythmic variation and many lines doing double duty for setting, emotion, and theme (e.g., the “wounded and beautiful” Earth, the “pressure change in the marrow of her bones”). Information density is high and there’s little true scaffolding or redundancy. The main weakness is a drift toward purple or pseudo-profound phrasing in spots (“intangibly tangible,” “sacred geography of what-could-have-been,” “canvas alive with echoes of infinite possibility”), which softens impact and feels slightly overworked by top-tier standards. Clarity and momentum remain intact, but a sharper, more distilled line would lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images, clear sequencing, and a good sense of rhythm; most sentences do multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, and plot). However, figurative language is dense and sometimes conventional (“stars pricked the violet sky like scattered diamond dust,” “felt like destiny in his palm”), risking over-ornamentation in places. There are minor redundancies around similar emotional beats (repeated emphasis on “brilliant dimness,” “frequency of belonging”) that could be tightened for sharper impact. Despite this, the closure image is clean and undulled by artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with recurring images doing real work. Yet there is noticeable repetition and near-paraphrase around key abstractions (“weight of unspoken words,” “sieved hush,” “manufactured memory/false memory”) that could be tightened without loss. Some figurative language veers toward purple or generic (“tides of time,” “holier weight of honesty”) and slightly dulls the closing impact. Nonetheless, prose remains lucid, largely free of scaffolding, and does not obstruct causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level writing is often beautiful, with strong sensory anchors (“storm-worn parapet,” “mist coiled in restless eddies”) and generally clean syntax. The piece occasionally leans toward purple prose and conceptual redundancy—multiple phrases reiterate similar ideas about apology, forgiveness, and wisdom—without adding much new pressure. Still, most sentences earn their keep by doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and the closure image is clear and uncluttered. Some tightening of abstract modifiers and thematic re-statements would sharpen momentum and lift this closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences are generally lean and purposeful, tying atmosphere, emotion, and action together without obvious scaffolding; rhythm and length vary well. Images like “Venus blazed with impossible clarity, a diamond needle stitching night to day” are vivid while staying legible, and most figurative language pulls its weight. There is some repetition of key abstractions (“backlash of regrets,” “alignment”) and a few slightly declarative lines near the end, but they don’t seriously drag momentum or obscure sense. No major loops, muddled metaphors, or grammar issues interfere with closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, character) and the rhythm shifts appropriately between descriptive and climactic moments. Imagery around light, archives, and the body is usually precise rather than generic, and the prose avoids clunky scaffolding or obvious loops. A few turns of phrase edge toward purple or conceptual overloading, but they don’t obscure sense or dull the closure image; tighter pruning could heighten impact in places.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and generally high-density, often doing double duty for atmosphere and emotion (e.g., “their aroma bloomed: cinnamon warmth, void-chill mint, and the sweet sorrow of memory”). However, figurative and abstract language is stacked heavily in many sentences, risking purple excess and slight redundancy (“cosmic intimacy,” “eternity,” “fabric of forever”). Clarity and closure imagery remain intact, but trimming a few modifiers and conceptual restatements would sharpen impact. There are no serious loops or mechanical errors to impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with meaningful images; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. A few phrases and metaphors verge on purple or redundant (“choking beauty,” “saline benediction,” several near-synonymous statements of the same insight), creating slight momentum drag. Still, clarity is never lost, and the final images are clean and memorable. Trimming a handful of overtly ornamental or thesis-like lines would bring the prose into an elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) with minimal waste, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. Recurrent motifs like stitching and lightness are echoed without feeling mechanically repetitive, though there are a couple of near-duplicate structural statements (“This was the essential action,” “This was the key”) that could be tightened. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt, not so dense as to become purple or muddled. There are no major clarity issues or scaffolding artifacts that sap momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is polished and often beautiful, with strong sensory nouns and rhythmic sentences (“a vibrant silence woven from wave sighs, the mountain’s breath, and starlight’s faint rustle”). There is some repetition and scaffold—“whispering hush,” “vibrant hush,” and “texture of transformation” recur in ways that start to feel explanatory rather than purely evocative. A few sentences lapse into abstract summation or quasi-philosophical definition that slightly dampens momentum in the closing stretch. Overall, though, clarity remains high, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished and controlled, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and function. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful (e.g., blackout as canvas, silence as “winking hush”), though it occasionally verges on purple without quite tipping into muddle. There are no major loops or scaffold sentences; momentum is steady despite the contemplative style. Minor repetition of motifs (“spark,” “silence,” “shadow”) reads as thematic patterning rather than redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and image-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“A single tear traced a straight path down her cheek, a physics mourned like a lost language, now returned.”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and internally consistent with the physics-altered world; there are few, if any, mixed metaphors or dead comparisons. Momentum holds despite lyricism because each paragraph advances either the ritual’s progress or Elara’s evolving stance, and there is minimal scaffolding or repetition. Some thematic sentences verge on purple or expository, but not enough to blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, theme), transitions are smooth, and there are no grammatical or clarity errors. However, figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence reaches for metaphor—which edges into purple prose and occasionally blurs emphasis. Key concepts and phrases recur in near-identical language (“rarefy,” “storm-kissed wonder,” “cartography of scars,” “vigil”) in ways that feel like conceptual loops rather than deepening variations. Tightening abstraction and pruning a few explicit thematic statements would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with strong image-making and clean grammar, and it generally maintains clarity. However, figurative language is dense in nearly every sentence, creating a mildly purple, over-textured surface that occasionally blurs emphasis. There are small paraphrase-feeling moves and repetitive abstractions (“dignified chaos,” “sanctuary of clarity,” multiple testament/witness lines) that could be tightened for momentum. Despite this, cause-and-effect and the closure image remain legible, and most lines still carry more than one layer of work.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line to line, the prose is polished, with good syntactic variety and high information density: almost every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Metaphors are generally apt and coherent; “luminous fracture” in particular is a strong, unifying image that carries through to closure. There is some repetition of thematic nouns (beauty, resistance, brokenness, bloom) and a few explanatory sentences that could be cut without loss, nudging the piece slightly toward over-articulation. Still, there are no major loops, mixed metaphors, or rhythm failures that impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are mostly lean despite their lyricism, and images are vivid without frequent muddle or contradiction. There are occasional dense metaphor clusters (“time’s cruel punctuation,” “horizon invited night,” “mercury leaves swirled into a luminous cyclone”) that brush against purple but stay intelligible and intentional. Redundancy and scaffold are minimal; nearly every sentence contributes to scene, mood, or character. The prose could be tightened slightly by trimming a few ornamented phrases, but momentum remains intact through the climax and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) and maintain clear momentum without syntactic monotony. Imagery like “river of liquid starlight flowing backward” and “memory drank the storm” is fresh and legible, and there are no serious metaphor muddles. There is some repetition of favored adjectives and luminous imagery, and a mild drift toward conceptual language near the end, which slightly reduces sharpness and urgency. Overall, however, the prose remains clear, rhythmic, and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, world) and read smoothly aloud, with few true redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically linked to sea, color, and growth, avoiding mixed metaphors. A few phrases repeat or lean purple (“rhythmically placid,” “diffuse” as a concept action, several direct thematic assertions), which slightly reduce sharpness but do not obscure meaning or dull closure. Overall momentum is appropriate for a lyric piece and never stalls in exposition.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.1)
    Significant mechanical flaws undermine the prose, including a glaring grammar error ("he had preprocesses reality") and the aforementioned tense confusion. The writing leans heavily on abstract nouns and filter verbs ("he realized," "he recalled") which distance the reader from the immediate experience. These artifacts suggest a lack of the polish required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and "purple" descriptors ("visceral echo," "annealed spirit," "delicate cartography"). Adjective-noun pairings are relentless and often abstract, stalling momentum. The literal insertion of prompt phrases (e.g., "steadily adaptive resilience") results in clunky, unnatural sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.8)
    Phrasing is often overwritten and adverb-heavy ("profoundly silently expressive grace" is a notable stumble). The prose leans on clichés ("liquid gold," "heart clenched") and "tell-heavy" summaries of emotional states ("grief bloomed," "anxiety flared") rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose has a smooth, meditative rhythm that suits the tone, though it occasionally relies on synonym churn ("deep, profound quiet") and adjective stacking ("sharp, sorrowful"). The pacing accelerates appropriately during the shard placement, supporting the density increase.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.1)
    The text suffers from severe repetitive artifacts, specifically the phrases "gently persistent" and "amplified quiet," which each appear three times in a very short space. This repetition reads as forced keyword insertion rather than organic prose, significantly hampering flow.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and modifiers ("lavish cascades," "visceral flash"), creating a sluggish rhythm that slows momentum. The phrase "foggy lucidity crystallized into truth" is a clunky mixed metaphor that obscures clarity for the sake of incorporating a prompt element.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is polished but suffers from an over-reliance on adjectives and flowery constructions ("dew-kissed," "trembling reverie," "solidified moonlight"). While the rhythm is generally smooth, the density of metaphors sometimes clogs the pacing, prioritizing poetic effect over clarity and momentum. The "read-aloud" quality is musical but occasionally cloying.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.2)
    A severe repetitive loop undermines the prose: the phrase "staggering grace" appears three times (lines 14, 21, 29) in a very short text, acting as a distracting verbal tic. The density of adjectives and abstract nouns ("reverent certainty," "quiet victory") clutters the sentences and stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from adjective-heavy description ("trembling path," "ghostly anemones") and repetitive phrasing artifacts. The phrase "while cells divide" is pasted in three times as a refrain that disrupts rhythm rather than building tension, and abstract nouns often obscure concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant repetitive scaffolding harms the prose; the phrase "destiny’s door" appears three times, and "luminous disbelief" is repeated verbatim in the final line. The reliance on abstract lists ("compass forged from moonlight, petals, and courage") and weak modifier-noun pairings ("quietly savvy") flattens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.4)
    Significant overwriting and purple prose ("sacred ordinary," "liquid metronome") clutter the sentences and slow momentum. The reliance on abstract noun phrases ("gravity of purpose softened by grace") and clichéd imagery ("tear traced a warm path") weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant repetitive artifacts (e.g., "transformative betrayal," "firmly adaptive," and "trembling certainty" each appear twice as forced phrases) disrupt the prose. The writing suffers from density issues and purple prose that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition artifacts, specifically the [Adjective] + "hush" construction ("ambered hush" x4, "marbled hush" x3, "silver-threaded hush," "woolen hush"). This synonym churn creates a robotic, rhythmic monotony. Additionally, abstract telling ("Her mild obsession lent unwavering precision") replaces concrete showing.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished but relies on abstract listing during the climax (“tactile, olfactory, auditory”) rather than concrete sensory immersion. Some phrasing leans toward stock description (“velvet black,” “glittering motes”), though the opening imagery is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and abstract nouns ("silent reverence," "universal feeling") that stall momentum. Metaphorical language ("quiet fire," "seeds") serves as decoration rather than clarifying the action.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is competent but marred by "telling" labels (e.g., "wisely pragmatic resolve") and interpretative summaries that stall momentum. Clichés like "veins like ancient roots" and "broken dreams" detract from the otherwise solid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.8)
    Line-level craft is severely hampered by the quadruple repetition of "mechanically warm" and double use of other complex phrases like "holographic principles" within a short space. These artifacts create a stuttering rhythm and expose the scaffold, preventing the prose from achieving flow or density.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.1)
    Evocative imagery is marred by the "lately inspired" text loop (4x usage) and adjectival overload. These artifacts disrupt the prose rhythm and highlight the artificiality of the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and sentimentality ("river of sorrowful emerald," "aching recognition," "tender smudges"). Metaphors are frequently explained immediately after being introduced. Adjective-heavy description ("cold, dense stone of remorse") slows the rhythm and reduces emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally competent, but the phrase "swallowed truth" is repeated three times (opening, climax, resolution), creating a distracting lexical loop. Some filtering ("Leo’s breath hitched") and abstract phrasing dull the immediacy of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but repetitive; distinct phrases like "regenerative silence" and "cryptic folds" appear multiple times in a short space, dulling their impact. Some imagery leans on familiar tropes ("emerald thread" for moss, "skeletal bookshelves"), though the flow remains rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose flow is severely disrupted by the mechanical insertion of prompt elements (e.g., "action of link," "defined by a softly adaptive attribute"), resulting in ungrammatical or clunky phrasing. The writing leans on abstract nouns and flowery modifiers ("purple prose") that reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose leans toward purple descriptions ("brittle maps of sorrow") and suffers from awkward constructions to fit required elements ("sensitively perceptive fingers"). These artifacts draw attention to the writing process rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is competent and rhythmic, though it leans heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("brittle relics," "shadowy past"). The inclusion of cumulative word count tags in the text is a distracting artifact, and the "telling" of the daughter's reaction reduces the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is strong, with rhythmic phrasing and evocative descriptions like "questions designed as gentle scalpels." There is a tendency toward "purple" abstraction ("liquid light," "restoration's hum"), but the prose is generally dense and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and abstract metaphor ("precise geometry where memory could breathe," "sacred cartography"). Phrases like "upturned hush" and "logarithmic curve" add density without clarity. The reliance on adjectival stacking slows momentum and obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is overwritten with stacked abstract metaphors ("walls of crystallized laughter twisted beside chasms of profound sorrow") that obscure the action. Repetition of prompt phrases ("procedural generation," "periodically eternal") creates noticeable text artifacts that drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("hollow stillness," "tactile symphony," "weathered hands") and abstract summaries of emotion ("emotional numbness fractured"). Phrasing like "audibly muted" creates POV friction for a deaf focalizer, and the climax relies on "telling" the emotional shift rather than showing the sensory details of the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally polished but dense with adjective-noun pairings ("unnatural lightness," "deliberate token"). A significant grammar error occurs in the sixth paragraph ("Unfastening the tube, its unnatural lightness sent a chill..."), where a dangling participle misattributes the action.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is functional but suffers from overwriting and "purple" descriptors ("crystalline clarity," "baptism of acceptance," "alchemized"). Adjective-heavy phrasing and stock metaphors clutter the climax, reducing the emotional immediacy of the memory.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is functional but suffers from adjective-heavy filtering ("star-dappled silence," "phantom imprint") and clichéd similes ("like liquid silver"). The mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("ethically playful") and abstract telling ("uncovering layers of sensation") prevents high-density engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from high figurative density ("acoustic tapestry," "velvety blanket," "sonic soul") that stifles immediacy. Abstract phrasings and personification ("dust motes dancing like forgotten memories") flatten the emotional resonance into philosophical assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose has strong rhythm and density, but is marred by significant clichés in peak beats, such as "unbidden tears traced warm paths" and "cool night air kissed his skin." These artifacts detract from the otherwise sharp imagery and weaken the emotional climax.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from repetition and "telling" artifacts, most notably using the phrase "cautious exuberance" twice (paragraphs 10 and 20) to label the emotion rather than evoking it. Phrasing occasionally drifts into purple territory ("logistics of the soul") that feels overlayed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density and "purple" phrasing ("luminescent ache," "reverent care") that tells the reader how to feel. There is a reliance on abstract noun-phrase constructions that slows momentum and distances the reader from immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is high-density and polished, with strong imagery ("water stilled to glass") that supports the frozen-time motif without stalling momentum. The rhythm effectively accelerates as the giant begins to stir, mirroring the collapsing timeframe.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from severe adjective-noun padding ("slow, persistent drip," "worn velvet pouch," "gently inventive," "fragile threads"), creating a sluggish, ornamental rhythm. The density of modifiers dilutes the impact of the stronger verbs and images.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished but marred by clichés ("minutes stretched like taffy") and adverb-heavy telling ("finally, beautifully, seen"). The phrase "sense memory" is used mechanically as a label in the narrative rather than being integrated into the character's immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished but relies heavily on abstract telling ("She believed preservation meant dominance") instead of showing these beliefs through action. Rhythmic control is competent, though the density of adjectives in the opening slows momentum without adding necessary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.8)
    A severe artifact degrades the prose: the phrase "wryly earnest" appears four times in ~700 words, applying to three different subjects, including in the closure beat. This repetition, along with the twice-stated motivation ("thresh meaning"), creates a template-like quality that distracts from otherwise competent imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose relies heavily on telling over showing ("Elara’s motivation was compassion itself") and utilizes abstract adjective-noun pairings ("shimmering reality," "magnified grace"). There are significant expository lumps that disrupt the rhythm and dilute the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.4)
    While mechanically polished, the prose relies on stock emotional phrasing ("eyes wide with wonder," "straightened his spine," "tears cutting paths through grime"). These clichés flatten the emotional impact of the healing moments. Summary-telling ("Elara administered her cure") replaces dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant "purple" overwriting and abstract metaphor strings ("symphonies," "poignant narratives," "baptism of release"). These constructions obscure the physical action and reduce immediacy, placing a veil of adjectival interpretation between the reader and the events.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is competent but suffers from the repetition of the phrase "courageously kind" (three times) and "unheard symphony," which read as prompt artifacts rather than organic descriptors. The reliance on abstract nouns (tapestry, symphony, resonance) in the climax reduces the visceral impact of the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is dense with modifier-heavy descriptions ("violent emerald and violet curtains") and stock metaphors ("sharp as shattered glass"). Abstract phrasing ("polished his boredom to a flawless, suffocating sheen") often obscures immediate sensory grounding, and the register drift in the middle disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.6)
    While polished, the prose suffers from abstract summary that shortcuts narrative work, particularly the clunky phrasing "facilitated the liquefaction of her rigid thinking." The reliance on "told" internal states rather than "shown" action drags on momentum in the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is significantly overwritten, relying on modifier stacking ("gilded-leaf," "blooming," "frozen," "battered") and clichés ("dawn bled rose-gold") that choke momentum. The density of adjectives distracts from the action, ironically violating the principle of "incandescent restraint" the story claims to embody.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from heavy modification and a lack of syntactic propulsion, relying frequently on adjective-noun pairings ("bruised dawn," "quiet certainty," "fragile mosaics") that slow the rhythm. The density of figurative language borders on "purple," prioritizing ornamentation over narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but marred by the logical impossibility of the cello and some purple phrasing. The oxymoron "gloomy cheerfulness" is repeated as a tell rather than evoked through imagery, and the description of the "ephemeral compass" relies on abstract assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from adjective stuffing ("breathtaking, chaotic mosaic," "vibrant, anarchic soul") and metaphor-heavy summaries ("spark ignited the network") that blur concrete action. Diagnostic telling ("His motivation was clear") replaces high-density scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is mechanically competent but dense with adjectival padding and clichés ("vast, bowl-shaped scar," "sweet and sorrowful ache"). The prompt phrase "dawnlit melancholy" appears awkwardly, and the repetition of "outlasted" works as a rhetorical device but highlights the lack of dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwriting and clichés ("hands... were her true eyes," "finer than spider silk"). There is a reliance on abstract nouns ("sovereignty," "sanctuary") and explanatory telling that slows momentum and reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is functional but marred by modifier stacking and telling-artifacts like "subtly confident grace" and "worrying tranquility," which violate the show-don't-tell principle. Information density is adequate, but the reliance on abstract nouns ("intention," "memory") weakens the physical immediacy of the scene. Rhythm is generally smooth, though the "worrying tranquility" phrase appearing twice creates a repetitive loop without accumulating new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies on clichés ("wind held its breath," "dancer's grace") and heavy scaffolding ("She knew," "She felt"). The explicit listing of prompt elements ("Her action was...", "Her method was...") creates a repetitive, mechanical cadence that deadens the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from frequent abstract labeling ("sorrowful static," "bittersweet anchor") and clichés ("panic was a luxury"). The reliance on adjective-noun pairings creates a "purple" density that dulls the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition artifacts mar the prose; the word "copperlight" appears six times and "hush" five times in a very short text, creating a template-cadence effect. "Lattice" and "scuffs" are also over-repeated, signaling forced prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe repetition of full phrases ("carved stone bead" x4, "mournful elation" x3, "lovingly venomous" x3) creates a checklist-like texture. Adjective clutter slows the pacing and dulls the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is marred by "purple" writing ("gleaming like captured starlight," "alchemized") and significant repetition of prompt phrases ("hauntingly optimistic" appears three times). Phrases like "fragrance of orchid solace" result in awkward, abstract syntax that obscures sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose suffers from abstract labeling ("cautious enchantment"), clichés ("veil between worlds... gossamer"), and metaphor-heavy "was" constructions ("scoop of soil was a whispered apology"). These artifacts distance the reader and reduce the scene's concrete impact.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and relies on "purple" descriptors ("sun’s first blush," "delicate ecosystem"). A major flaw is the repetition of the phrase "carefully inventive" three times (lines 4, 12, and 33), creating a distinct template artifact that disrupts the reading rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant repetitive artifacts undermine the prose quality; the phrase "echoed silence" appears three times, and "cobalt" five times in a short text. The prose relies on clichés ("hung in the balance," "swirled like embers") and telling, failing the density and variety tests.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished but dense with adjectives and metaphors ("bruised twilight," "yielding mud") that slow the rhythm and feel overwrought. The high frequency of figurative language occasionally distracts from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the prose flows smoothly, it is hindered by overwriting and a reliance on abstract nouns and adverbs ("rigid terror," "meticulous tenderness"). The repetition of the prompt word "unknot" feels mechanical, and the density of figurative language ("stark white cast... canvas") slows momentum without adding causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose is marred by scaffold sentences that announce prompt elements ("Her action was to display...", "The core concept unfolded...") rather than integrating them. Heavy filtering ("She saw," "She could almost feel") and cliché phrasings ("blurred time itself," "crystalline moment") dull the immediacy of the imagery. The rhythm is often sluggish, weighed down by adjective-heavy description.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose contains noticeable redundancy loops, specifically "breathless suspension where time itself seemed to hold its breath." The "nested awakening" phrasing feels slightly clinical against the lyrical backdrop. Information density is decent, but abstract nouns ("bewitchment," "enchantment") clutter the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from the repetitive use of specific phrases ("spark of defiance" x3, "converging chaos" x3, "candidly cryptic" x2) in a very short text, creating a jarring echo. Clichés like "steady steel" and "hanging like dew" weaken the imagery. The density is artificial, achieved through adjective stacking rather than active verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=2.8)
    Significant text-artifacting undermines the prose. Unique, complex phrases are repeated verbatim, acting as unintentional refrains that break immersion: "shyly unstoppable" (3x), "off-key wind" (3x), "reef-shadow joy" (2x), "ensconced" (2x). Figurative language is often mixed or muddled ("photosynthesize pain," "bloom like night-blooming cereus" next to "verses").

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.1)
    Significant loop artifacts lower the score: "gently systematic" appears three times, and "foxglove regret" (or "foxglove truth") appears three times, acting as crutches rather than motifs. The prose is dense with adjectival clutter that slows momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is dense with purple modifiers ("reverent finger," "focused daring," "fragile but steady flame") that clutter the imagery. The repetition of "cautious exuberance" constitutes a significant artifact. Metaphors are often mixed or cliché ("swirled like captured starlight," "tears of relief traced warm paths").

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose suffers from adjective density and high-concept filler ("fragile as memory") that clogs momentum. The pivotal sentence involving the "spectrometer" analysis of adhesive to find a "hidden cipher" is a significant logic break that undermines credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally functional but suffers from some overwriting ("Each mote was a tiny historian") and semantic awkwardness in forcing prompt phrases ("atmosphere embodied blooming withering"). The reliance on abstract nouns ("restoration," "fabrication") sometimes dilutes the impact of the concrete imagery, and the density of adjectives slows the rhythm unnecessarily.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.5)
    The text relies heavily on repetitive loops and abstract phrasing ("fractured hush," "necessary distances," "featherly determined") that clutter the prose. The density of abstract nouns over concrete verbs creates a "purple" effect that distances the reader from the immediate experience. The repetition of key phrases acts as a scaffold that was not removed.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.0)
    Significant text artifacts arise from repeating specific multi-word phrases ("shadowseam wonder," "softly ingenious") within a short space. These forced insertions disrupt flow, creating visible scaffold and synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mechanically sound, but the prose suffers from adjective clutter and the repetitive use of the prompt phrase "cheerful gloom" as a telling tag. The reliance on modifier-heavy descriptions ("salt-etched memories," "violet loneliness") reduces momentum and creates a dense, slightly static texture.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive adjective-noun pairings ("damp stone bench," "ancient stone embrace," "weathered colonnade," "worn boots"), creating a sluggish rhythm. While mechanically clean, the over-reliance on modifiers to generate atmosphere reduces the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is overwrought, heavily relying on adjective stacking and abstract verbs ("alchemized," "leached"). The specific phrase "obsidian grace" is repeated verbatim, creating a noticeable artifact, and the object name "moonstone cabochon dust speck" is rhythmically clunky and obstructive.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant repetitive phrasing undermines the prose ("noctilucent" appears three times; "mundane" three times; "read between the lines" three times; "commune/communion" four times). The reliance on abstract nouns ("narrative," "solidarity," "resilience") to describe visual phenomena violates the "show, don't tell" principle. These artifacts stall momentum and flatten the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=2.5)
    Significant penalties for repetitive text artifacts and heavy adjective density. The phrases "gently skilled" (3x), "reflecting deeply" (2x), and "hard softness" (2x) appear as clumsy forced insertions that disrupt the flow. The prose is cluttered with "synonym churn" and metaphors that obscure rather than clarify the action.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is polished but dense with "adjective-noun" pairings and abstract metaphors ("silent seeds," "anchors despair"). The reliance on flowery descriptors ("cathedral of stone") slows momentum and distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from verbatim repetition of complex phrases ("sensitively perceptive" x3, "legacy's burden" x3, "film negative strip" x3) within a short word count. These artifacts read as forced constraints that break the rhythm and create a "template cadence" feel, obscuring the otherwise competent descriptive work.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting, relying on stacked modifiers ("perceptively calm assurance") and abstract metaphors ("liquid hope," "bronze voices") that blur the imagery. The density of adjectives slows the pacing and distances the reader from the physical action. "Liquid rainbows" and similar phrases lean into cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose relies on stock metaphors ("silence... heavier than stone," "roadmap of old grievances," "kissed the horizon") that dull the imagery. While grammatically clean, the reliance on cliché prevents the line-level work from matching the story's literary ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose has good rhythm but suffers from mixed metaphors ("map drawn by... gasp") and clichéd phrasing ("liquid-silver song," "impossible blue"). The anaphoric "Let the..." sequence feels more rhetorical than authentically internal, creating a stylistic distance during the intimate climax.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the prose is descriptive, it suffers from significant repetition of prompt-specific phrasing ("bodily poetic," "sigh and smile") within a short word count. These text loops, combined with a tendency toward heavy adjective stacking ("luminous filaments," "latent memory"), create a cluttered rhythm that drags on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition artifacts mar the prose; the specific phrases "uncommon serenity" (4x) and "meteor hush" (3x) are pasted in mechanically within a very short word count, creating a robotic cadence. The writing relies on abstract, "purple" descriptors ("fragile epiphanies," "meticulous grace") that reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant repetitive artifacts harm the prose: the required phrases "transiently rooted" and "interrupted cadence" appear three times each in a short space, feeling mechanical. Clichés ("minutes stretched like spun sugar," "diamond dew") and explanatory sentences reduce the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is competent but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("technically gentle" x3, "snowmelt ardor" x2) that reads as text artifacts. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings creates a dense, overwrought texture that slows propulsion. The "Time dissolved" transition elides the actual work, weakening the scene's density.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.9)
    Competent sentence flow is marred by dense clusters of abstract nouns and repetitive phrasing (e.g., "crystalline" appears twice in close proximity). Prompt phrases like "precisely playful" are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is marred by severe repetition artifacts, specifically the phrase "schematic representations" appearing five times and "dusky harmony" three times in a short space. These forced insertions disrupt the rhythm and read as mechanical prompt-checking rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density and abstract noun phrases that slow momentum ("violent spasms," "resilient rhythm"). A major scaffold artifact appears with the line "This attribute was undeniable: it reappeared when needed," which reads like a prompt instruction inserted directly into the text, breaking immersion. The reliance on filter verbs ("He recalled," "He felt") distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is polished but adjective-heavy ("fractured brass," "quiet urgency," "mist-shrouded limbo"), leaning into purple description that slows momentum. Several sentences function as scaffold artifacts ("Her action was to recreate the sextant’s purpose"), which should have been subtextualized into action. The rhythm is lulling and lacks the variation needed to build tension.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.0)
    Line-level craft is competent but marred by "telling" over "showing" (e.g., "Accidental wisdom bloomed"). The overuse of the prompt word "feisty" creates repetitive artifacts, and the logic break regarding the ribbon's location creates confusion in the action sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose relies frequently on clichés and abstract noun phrases ("quiet fire," "silent challenge," "wave of calm," "solemn weight"). These stock phrases flatten the emotional impact and clutter the line-level momentum. The reliance on filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") further dilutes the immediacy of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is marred by pervasive "noun of noun" constructions ("syntax of shadow," "cipher of root and regret," "cartography of integrity") which create a repetitive, artificial cadence. Prompt phrases like "Her method was precise..." are inserted mechanically, disrupting flow.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the prose has rhythm, the ending dissolves into abstract summary and metaphorical density that obscures concrete action ("reverence," "sacred space," "freedom vaster than any ocean"). The reliance on high-concept abstraction reduces the visceral impact of the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing, notably the reuse of "warmly methodical" and the word "clarity" (four times), which feels like a bludgeon. Some descriptions lean toward purple ("liquid memory," "cathedral of measured time") without adding precision. The writing is technically functional but relies too heavily on telling ("Clarity, warm and certain, washed over Elara") rather than showing the emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.5)
    The phrase "gently luminous" appears four times and "frantic" three times in a short span, creating significant loop artifacts that stall the narrative flow. Adjectival density ("visceral, soul-deep," "frantic luminescence") often crowds the verbs, reducing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but relies heavily on stock imagery ("tears traced clean paths," "twilight bled into deep indigo," "symphony of light"). Adjective-noun pairings are frequent and sometimes reduce impact through overwriting ("reverent fingertips," "profound quiet"). The repetition of the prompt phrase "thistle-blown hope" feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with adjectival clutter ("preemptively nostalgic sorrow," "visceral echo," "alchemized into quiet certainty"). These constructions tell the reader how to feel rather than evoking the sensation through concrete imagery. The density of modifiers ("obsidian," "granite," "pearlescent," "violet") slows the rhythm and creates a "purple" texture that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from "purple" tendencies and abstract metaphors ("liquid memory," "buoyant weight") that blur clarity. Required phrases like "ambient awareness" feel inserted as labels rather than dissolving organically into the action.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from heavy abstraction and adjectival clutter ("texture of time itself," "granular feel," "refused to let the pause become a void"). The repetition of "warmly observant" constitutes a distractingly visible artifact, and the density of "meaning-making" phrases stifles the action.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is often "purple" and relies on abstract telling ("intangibly tangible," "limiting exposure to visual noise"). There is a tendency to use adjective-noun pairings that decorate rather than drive ("gilded hush," "steadfast xenial grace"). Sentences frequently summarize internal states instead of dramatizing them through action or sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is dense with adverbs and modifier-noun pairings ("fluidly logical precision," "impeccably clear," "weary peace," "gentle catalyst"), creating a sluggish rhythm. Sentence structures are repetitive (Subject-Verb-Participle phrasing dominates), and the reliance on abstract emotional labels weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is functional but dense with adjective-noun pairs and clichés ("profound stillness," "fragile scrolls"). The insertion of the phrase "wisely adventurous" disrupts the rhythm and reads as awkward telling.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is dense with redundant modifiers ("ashen charcoal") and abstract nominalizations ("oxygen of presence," "loaded emptiness"). The reliance on filter verbs and poetic abstraction obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is dense with "purple" abstractions ("shadowseam wonder incarnate," "diamonds of meaning") and cliché metaphors that obscure rather than reveal. The text relies on telling over showing, using high-concept adjectives to insist on the story's emotional weight instead of earning it through specific detail.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is dense with figurative language that sometimes obscures clarity or mixes metaphors, such as "standing waves of courage" and "first yawn of evening." While grammatically clean, the reliance on personification and abstract imagery ("gilding dust motes," "fallen promise") creates a barrier to immediacy and slows the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting, dense with abstract adjectives and metaphors ("pulsing dream-fruit," "universe-sigh," "forgotten star-languages") that slow momentum. This heavy reliance on ornamentation obscures the immediate action and leans on "telling" through grandeur rather than "showing" through concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from overuse of abstract nouns and adjectives ("deliberate care," "anxious touch," "quiet mending"), creating a dense, slightly purple texture. Clichés like "held its breath" and "unfurl like a secret" appear at key moments. Repetitive phrasing (the word "quiet" appears 6 times) and filter verbs dull the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies heavily on "workshop" clichés ("tapestry of stars," "perfect mirror," "dust motes danced," "decisive click"). Abstract nouns frequently act as agents ("indifference that revised histories"), and the phrasing often tells rather than shows ("careful resourcefulness").

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("spectral fingers," "muscle memory deeper than thought") and the repetitive, forced insertion of prompt phrases that disrupt the natural rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant text artifacts and repetition harm the prose quality; the awkward phrase "mossy delight" is repeated four times, and "moonstone cabochon dust speck" three times. The writing is overwritten with adjective-heavy descriptions ("lattice of frost-kissed twigs," "serene isolation") that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("cascade of realizations") and awkward phrasing to accommodate required elements (e.g., "light came from the method of her passage"). The logic of the sentence structure occasionally breaks under the weight of these insertions.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.5)
    The text suffers from severe repetitive artifacts; the word "luminous" appears eight times, often as a modifier for abstract nouns. The phrase "factually mystical" is repeated three times clumsily. This density of repetition and abstract adjective stacking ("deep, quiet need") significantly hampers flow and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, but marred by awkward phrasing inserted to meet prompt requirements (e.g., "Her modestly fearless attribute was not recklessness"). Repetitive phrasing ("distorted notes," "spectral confessions") dampens the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.5)
    Three instances of subject-verb disagreement ("he brace") constitute a major mechanical failure in a piece of this length. Additionally, terms like "proprioceptively" are slightly misused (confusing internal body awareness with tactile sensation), and the prose occasionally drifts into purple territory.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is polished but adjective-heavy and overwritten, relying on abstract metaphors ("bottled echoes," "paradox of presence and absence") that blur imagery. High-pressure moments are filtered through "scaffolding" words (felt, heard, saw) rather than immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is weighed down by purple modifiers ("sorrowful luminescence," "profound silence," "ethereal light") and redundancy ("sputter and dying hum"). The explicit insertion of prompt keywords results in syntactic stumbling blocks, particularly the robotic phrasing regarding his observational attribute, which disrupts the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density ("endless swirl," "impossible sanctuary," "intricate gears"), creating a slow, cushioned rhythm. Stock phrasing ("beautiful and terrifying all at once") and reliance on abstract nouns weaken the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but overwrought, relying heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("gilded cherubs," "weeping stone angels"). Emotional beats are often summarized with abstract labels ("burnished sorrow," "polished ache") rather than dramatized through fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and stock phrasing ("knuckles white," "tears of strain," "universe sighing relief"). Explanatory interruptions (defining verdigris) and adjectival density slow the momentum during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished with some strong imagery ("ghost of water"), but suffers from repetition ("profound silence," "profound hush") and label-heavy descriptors. The phrase "sensibly eccentric" reads as a scaffold rather than an organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.9)
    Technically functional, but the prose is weighed down by abstract nouns and adjective-heavy descriptions ("ancestral precision," "dawn-kissed mist"). The reliance on tell-heavy constructions for mental states ("This was reimagination through layered meanings") dulls the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is overwritten with high adjective density ("fragile as dried petals," "profound humility"). A significant repetition artifact occurs where the unique phrase "umbral tenderness" appears twice (lines 199, 297) and "dawning hush" twice (lines 92, 279) in a short text, creating a distracting loop. The style prioritizes ornamentation over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from a heavy reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("searing reverie," "desperate grace," "gritty chill," "profound relief"), creating a repetitive, dense rhythm. Metaphors like "hands bore the ink stains of forgotten truths" feel strained and performative rather than precise.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished but prone to "purple" phrasing ("forgotten tears," "quiet ferocity," "grave but a cradle") and abstract telling ("clarity crystallized"). While rhythmically sound, these artifacts blunt the immediacy of the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished but suffers from "purple" metaphors that blur imagery at pivotal moments (e.g., "petals the soft pink of a held breath"). These abstractions reduce precision, prioritizing poetic sound over concrete sense.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is dense with abstract metaphors ("rough fibrous hope," "crystalline sigh") that obscure rather than clarify the moment. The phrase "texture of borrowed time" is repeated four times, creating a lexical loop. The "furiously tranquil" phrasing appears as a clumsy modifier rather than an earned description.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally polished, but forced integration of prompt phrases causes stumbling blocks; specifically, "after the glue dries" creates a jarring tense shift within its sentence. "Credibly curious" reads as an awkward, told-not-shown label that disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is excessively "purple," saturated with abstract nouns ("truth," "elegance," "resilience") and mixed metaphors ("silence was fertile soil," "heart a tuning fork") that obscure rather than illuminate. While technically competent in grammar, the density of "profound" descriptors halts narrative momentum and results in a lack of concrete, grounded imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from adjective stuffing and abstract noun clusters ("tranquilly perceptive grace," "sorrowful posture"). The writing tells rather than shows ("mute eloquence saturated the air"). The integration of the phrase "contextual clues" creates a significant register clash, reading more like technical analysis than literary narration.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but overwritten, relying on abstract adjective-noun pairings ("silken slide," "velvet of peace") that blur clarity. The "time leaks love" metaphor stands out as a sentimental artifact that reduces the grit of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is overwritten, suffering from a high density of adjectives and strained metaphors (&quot;gentle percussion,&quot; &quot;kissing smoothed stone&quot;) that slow momentum. This &quot;purple prose&quot; obscures the action and feels self-conscious.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from adjectival clutter ("gently systematic," "emerald lace"). The reliance on summary reduces propulsion, though the final image of the acorn is a strong, concrete anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing that acts as a scaffold; the specific phrases "luminous skeptic" and "bronze quiet" are repeated three to four times each in a short space, creating a mechanical rhythm. Adjective-noun pairings are dense and occasionally clutter the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is dense with adjectival scaffolding and clichés ("tears traced clean paths," "riot of color"), and the overuse of personification ("defiant ribbon," "stubborn roses") creates a melodramatic texture that dulls clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is overwritten and explanatory ("The revelation was profoundly tinted..."). Phrasing like "intuitively descriptive nature noted anomalies" acts as a clumsy filter that flattens the POV and violates show-don't-tell.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally polished, with strong visual metaphors, but suffers from some abstract phrasing ("resolve crystallizing like starlight") that mixes vehicles. There is a reliance on "telling" constructions ("Her confusion shattered") that sap immediacy. The density of information is adequate, though the brevity of the piece leaves little room for rhythmic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is dense with abstract nouns ("arrogance," "harmony," "fidelity") and expository assertions. There are frequent "telling" artifacts where character traits are simply listed. The rhythm is repetitive, often following a pattern of describing a negative object and its positive replacement without syntactic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("like a held breath," "moths to a fragile flame," "bled through") and abstract noun phrases ("silence fell, deeper than absence"). Melodramatic word choices ("screamed of the vanished ordinary") and the personification in the final line ("hope took its first... step") detract from the specific physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose flows smoothly but suffers from a high density of clichés and adjectival stacking ("sharp as shattered glass," "cleansing rain," "whispering on stone"). The reliance on familiar metaphors to describe emotional peaks flattens the impact of the climax. A tighter edit would remove the "hidden thunder of suppressed sorrow" type constructions in favor of concrete, original imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from adverb-heavy telling, specifically in the insertion of prompt phrases like "fidgeted productively" and "winnowed relentlessly." Some imagery borders on cliché ("tears of remorse," "leaden sky"), and the sentence rhythm in the resolution becomes somewhat repetitive. The integration of required wording occasionally disrupts the natural flow of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.2)
    The specific phrase "innocently mischievous" is repeated three times in a short space, creating a jarring, repetitive artifact that clashes with the solemn tone. The prose leans purple ("petrified prayers") and relies on abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose relies heavily on "telling" summaries ("Uncertainty dissolved," "Meaning had been conjured") rather than concrete action. Repetitive use of "narrated" as a dialogue tag and abstract phrasing dilute the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is overwritten, suffering from modifier congestion (e.g., "dawn-gilded," "weary sigh," "bilge-water spray"). Metaphors are often mixed or grandiose, drawing attention to the writing style rather than the narrative substance.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=2.1)
    The prose is dense with "text artifacts" of overwriting: stacked modifiers, oxymoronic clichés ("screaming tenderness"), and abstract nouns. The "bruised purple dawn" and "cerulean sentinel" in the opening line set a pattern of adjective-stuffing that clogs momentum and obscures clarity. Line-level craft lacks the economy required for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.3)
    Significant penalties for the verbatim repetition of complex phrases ("geography of loss" x4, "raw solace" x3) which creates a checklist effect. Metaphors are often mixed or clichéd ("sorrow's crucible," "bridge across grief's chasm").

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by filter verbs ("She found," "She remembered," "She envisioned") that dilute immediacy. The explicit labeling of the theme ("living metaphor") disrupts the fictive dream, reading more like an authorial note than character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is polished, with strong rhythmic control and evocative imagery like the cover "cracked like old ice." Minor artifacting appears in the forced repetition of prompt phrases ("softly persistent"), but the prose generally flows with momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is mechanically sound but suffers from abstract descriptions and label-heavy characterization. The repetition of "empirically intuitive" (three times) creates a noticeable artifact that disrupts the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.3)
    Mechanical insertion of prompt elements creates significant line-level friction, resulting in ungrammatical or robotic phrasing ("arduous action of climb," "This method of shared recognition"). These artifacts disrupt the prose rhythm and highlight the scaffolding behind the story.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose is dense with abstract noun phrases ("density of presence," "chromatic embrace") and "purple" descriptors ("bleeding violet"). While the rhythm is controlled, the reliance on telling the reader what to feel creates opacity and slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose relies on stock phrases ("silent testament," "storms weathered," "minutes bled into decades") that dull the imagery. The pivotal message on the scroll is a derivative cliché that undermines the literary ambition of the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is polished but overwritten, heavily reliant on adjective-noun pairings ("patient precision," "silent virus," "trembling calm") and clichés ("tears welled," "voice frayed"). The phrase "breathed in liquid time" edges into mixed metaphor or purple prose. The narrative frequently tells the reader the significance of an image immediately after presenting it, reducing the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and cliché ("liquid starlight," "saturated hush"). Conceptual artifacts ("visual story of falling, breaking, healing, and rising") clutter the narrative flow, turning action into abstract summary. The rhythm is consistent but weighed down by adjectival density.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally polished with nice rhythmic variation, but suffers from "telling" at crucial moments ("Ethereal grit coated her soul"). The reliance on adjectives and similes ("like restless spirits," "like a shard of ice") occasionally clogs the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The phrase "resounding hush" is repeated four times (lines 11, 23, 33, 38) in a short text, creating a distracting echo that feels like a scaffold rather than a refrain. The prose is otherwise functional but leans on standard descriptors like "guttering candle."

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.0)
    Imagery is precise and evocative ("cold iron teardrop," "silver tear returning to the sky"). The prose falls short of the highest band due to the repetition of the phrase "eminently peculiar" and some heavy-handed phrasing around the realization ("Understanding flooded his mind"). Line-level propulsion during the count is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.2)
    While grammatically clean, the prose suffers from significant repetition (the word "quiet" appears eight times) and reliance on abstract labeling ("liminal time," "quiet revolution"). Filter verbs ("She hoped," "She realized," "She felt") distance the reader from the immediate experience, and the density of adjectives slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is dense with "label-speak" and abstract nouns ("resilient hope," "warm compassion," "profound understanding") instead of concrete imagery. The text relies on "purple" descriptors and similes ("thin as breath, strong as memory") that prioritize ornament over narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but leans into abstraction; metaphors occasionally border on purple ("shadows clung," "calm current"), though the density of imagery is generally effective.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from visible repetition of prompt phrases ("gently thorough" appears three times; "haunted euphoria" and "proximate causes" twice), creating a mechanical cadence. Heavy reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("damp wood," "faded photo," "quiet flame") and abstract metaphors ("skin and sorrow") reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("dusk bled gold," "tears traced clean paths") and abstract nominalizations ("resonant warmth," "quiet revolution"). The density of adjectives and forced metaphors ("jocular bark") obscures clarity and slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant line-level flaws undermine the craft: "She had dowse not for water" is a tense error, and "She sat in quiet blaze revelation" is syntactically broken. The phrase "quiet blaze" is repeated four times in a short space, becoming a forced motif that clutters the prose rather than enriching it. The writing relies on adjective-heavy abstraction over concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant deduction for repetitive artifacting and scaffold loops. Key phrases ("thresh meaning," "contingent relationships," "strange comfort") are repeated 3–4 times each, creating a drumbeat of redundancy that clutters the prose. These repetitions act as tell-y labels that flatten the density and polish of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting, utilizing cliché adjective-noun pairs ("weathered wooden docks," "quiet certainty") and abstract metaphors that obscure clarity. The repetition of "joyful sorrow" and the reliance on "symphony" and "alchemy" create a density of "purple" artifacts that stalls momentum and substitutes flowery description for precision.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is often purple ("tears, hot as embers yet gentle as dew") and prompt integration causes significant friction. The phrase "act of portray" is a grammatical error forced by the prompt, and "analytically intuitive" is a clunky modifier stack that disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the prose has rhythm, it suffers from the repetition of specific prompt phrases ("auroral sorrow" appears three times, "quiet rebellion" three times) which act as scaffolding artifacts. The climax relies on adjectival stacking ("pure auroral sorrow," "fervent precision") rather than concrete verbs, and the density of labels reduces the momentum of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is mechanically sound but prone to "thesaurus-itis" and clunky modifiers ("calculated spontaneity," "fracturing against the steel walls"). The pacing is steady, but the reliance on telling over showing ("understanding dawning," "profound quiet") dulls the impact of the imagery. There are no major technical artifacts, but the style lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is dense with adjectives and adverbs ("spiralingly calm," "infinitesimal precision"), creating a sluggish rhythm that obstructs momentum. There is a tendency toward purple prose ("gleaming like a smoothed river stone") that draws attention to the writing rather than the scene. "Spiralingly" is a particularly distracting artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant repetitive artifacts distract from the prose; the word "cradle" appears five times in various forms, and phrases like "unspoken words" and "forests of second thoughts" repeat. These loops, combined with abstract metaphors, clutter the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is overwritten, heavily relying on adjective-noun pairings ("dancer's precision," "ancient sentinels," "iridescent dust") and clichés like "tears mingled with seawater." This adjectival padding slows momentum and results in a dense, flowery texture that obscures rather than reveals.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers significantly from the clumsy, verbatim repetition of the phrase "morally ambiguous" three times (lines 10, 14, 22), which reads as a forced checklist insertion. Additionally, the writing is dense with adjectives and explanatory abstract nouns ("profound alchemy," "industrial enforcement") that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from frequent punctuation errors, particularly missing commas in absolute phrases and compound predicates (e.g., "whisper their voice a soft counterpoint," "stepped forward and the ice"). Repetitive phrasing of prompt elements ("lantern-moth hush," "aesthetically driven") and adjective-heavy stacking create a dense, sluggish rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("world held its breath," "frozen tears") and mixed metaphors ("molten glass glittered like frozen tears"—mixing heat/liquid with cold/solid). The reliance on abstract, flowery descriptors ("vibration painting light") obscures concrete action and sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant repetitive artifacts harm the prose: the phrase "golden shadows" appears five times in a short text, and "powerfully gentle" appears twice. These loops, combined with oxymoronic phrasing ("powerfully gentle grace"), indicate a lack of line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is serviceable but marred by the clunky integration of required phrases ("subdued ardor," "genuinely artificial") and cliché metaphors ("hitting rock bottom"). These artifacts disrupt the rhythm and call attention to the writing process over the story.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is competent but leans toward "purple" description ("bruised twilight," "constellation of collective healing") that prioritizes ornamentation over propulsion. Line-level rhythm is somewhat monotonous, with a tendency to stack metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjective density and "telling" complex states ("anguished joy," "silence was a physical presence"). There is a reliance on scaffolding ("Her motivation was...", "The ritual was...") that slows momentum and reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from abstract modifiers and clichés ("tears traced warm paths," "breathtaking diversity") that dull the imagery. The repetition of the phrase "softly deliberate" feels mechanical, and the density of "luminous" and "sacred" descriptors reduces their impact.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is overwritten with adjectival clutter ("quietly vivid tapestry," "fragile convictions") and mixed metaphors ("cold stone... shattering... compass"). The reliance on therapy-speak ("shedding layers," "internal work," "reconstruct her foundation") flattens the emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.4)
    Significant repetition of key phrases ("displaced miracle" 5x, "meteor hush" 3x) creates a checklist artifact effect. Adjective density and "therapy-speak" labels in the resolution ("closure," "affirmation") flatten the prose's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose relies on clichés ("silent witness," "symphony of sorrow," "hushed thunder") and telling abstract states ("irrevocably changed") instead of showing. Metaphors are frequent but often familiar, reducing their impact.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("fragile flame," "velvet blackness," "tears blurred the stars") and relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings that dull the imagery. Metaphors are frequent but often mixed or decorative ("needle of light stitching moments"), slowing momentum without adding precision. The high density of purple prose artifacts obscures the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies heavily on expository scaffolding ("This hum was the charm’s catalyst," "His motivation burned quiet") and abstract telling ("paradox," "devotion"). There are minor repetitive structures in the action beats. The density of "telling" distances the reader from the immediate physical experience of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is weighted down by adjective-noun pairings ("deliberate reverence," "interlocking cogs") and filter verbs ("He felt," "He understood"). Prompt phrases like "hum of insight" and "wild frontier of your mind" are repeated excessively, creating a scaffolded feel.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, relying on dense, abstract metaphors ("leash of long sorrow," "map of gentle lines," "constellation of promise") that obscure clarity. The phrase "shoreline lullaby" is repeated four times in a short space, reading as a mechanical text loop rather than a resonant motif.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and high-density ("shroud," "hush," "landscape"), maintaining a strong rhythm. While generally evocative, the metaphor density is high ("body a landscape of mending nerves"), bordering on overwrought in places, but it fits the requested atmospheric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from abstract overwriting ("potent with concentrated veracity," "action of sunder made manifest") and cliché phrasing ("silent weight," "serpent’s smile," "turning wheel of ages"). The reliance on adjectives and heavy metaphors ("pooled like still water") slows momentum and distances the reader from the action. "Benevolent fireflies" in the final paragraph tilts into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.2)
    While grammatically sound, the prose suffers from overwriting and excessive alliteration ("sentinel of sorrow, sanctuary of sound"). Abstract-concrete mixtures like "smudged with salt and sorrow" weaken the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from heavy modification and sentimental clichés ("glittering like forgotten tears," "needle of hope"). Abstract nouns and oxymorons ("thunderous serenity") clutter the sentences, reducing momentum and obscuring the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is functional but prone to overwriting ("ghostly plumes," "broken constraints") and emotional clichés like "tears streamed... not of sorrow, but vindication." Sentences often summarize emotional states with labels instead of evoking them through specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is burdened by abstract nouns and telling, with significant repetition artifacts (the "realism/optimism" pairing and "quietly talented" recur mechanically). These repetitions stifle rhythm and highlight the checklist nature of the composition.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is weighed down by excessive modification and awkward integration of required phrases. The line "visceral manifestation of the timeframe when the walls close in" is clunky and breaks immersion. Meta-commentary labeling dialogue as a "rhetorical question" ("the rhetorical question tasting of ash") is an artifact that disrupts flow.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.8)
    A specific repetitive artifact damages the prose: the phrase "serene anger" appears four times in a short space (lines 5, 11, 18, 30), creating a template cadence. While some imagery is lovely, the reliance on telling ("consciously wild nature was a chosen path") and the repetitive tagging lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from adjective stacking and occasional awkward phrasing ("This was contraband truths"). Density is high, but the "crack" of the boot is a cliché interrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from severe keyword stuffing, repeating "tranquil blaze" (3x), "engraved quiet" (2x), and the awkward "senselessly perceptive" (2x) within a very short word count. These act as placeholders for genuine description and degrade the reading experience significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is generally competent but marred by stock phrasing in pivotal moments ("tears welled unbidden," "broken heart," "fractured dream"). The repetition of "transliterate" and "feral lullaby" as labels rather than organic descriptors creates a scaffolded feel that lowers line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.2)
    While individual sentences are well-crafted, the prose suffers from severe repetition of prompt elements ("devotedly observant" appears four times; "orbits of regret" three times in a short text). These scaffold loops create a distracting checklist texture.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose relies on abstract metaphors ("needles of pure sorrow") and therapy-speak ("acknowledgment and translation," "utterly unseen") that violate the "Show, Don't Tell" standard. High adjective density clutters the imagery without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.8)
    High lexical fatigue affects the prose (7 references to "lilac/violet" in 385 words). Abstract phrasing ("emotional textures," "soft sensory unease") and clichés ("turning lead... into gold") reduce line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is overwritten with "purple" descriptors ("whispered across," "spirit a quiet flame") and suffers from a severe register clash with the clinical phrase "retrocognitively trapped" inside a mythic/poetic frame. Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a pattern of abstract assertion followed by metaphorical explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe overwriting and metaphor density ("bronze smoke tasting of caramel," "liquid sapphire," "molten gold") obstruct narrative momentum. The prose relies on filter verbs ("she perceived," "she watched") and stock metaphor strings that violate the density guardrails for high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is functional but dense with modifier-noun pairings ("sharp ozone," "quiet significance," "fragile resilience") that slow momentum. Several clichés ("tears streamed," "hope like a precious seed") and the repetition of the prompt phrase "fractally precise" reduce freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is generally competent but marred by a significant dangling modifier at the climax ("Focusing her heat-mapping intent..., the fossil began to float") and clichés like "tears traced clean paths." The phrasing "factually mystical" reads as awkward and forced, likely due to prompt adherence.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.1)
    Significant lexical redundancy harms the prose; the word "quiet" or "quietly" appears seven times, creating an unintentional, distracting drumbeat. The text is also cluttered with high adjective density and mixed metaphors ("hairline fracture bleeding dust"), which stifles the rhythm and clarity of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is severely marred by lexical repetition, with distinctive phrases like "silver hush," "fragile," "broken," and "unused courage" repeating 3–4 times each. This redundancy creates a robotic, template-like cadence that destroys immersion and readability.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is dense with mixed metaphors ("anchored the palimpsest," "percolate... through the filter") and purple descriptors ("spindrift serenity"). Prompt phrases are inserted conspicuously, disrupting the natural rhythm of the sentences. The high adjective count slows momentum without adding necessary information or specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.2)
    Sentence structure suffers from severe repetitive scaffolding, with nearly every major action initiated by a "He [verb]" construction ("He knelt," "He knew," "He moved," "He positioned," "He watched," "He rose"). This mechanical cadence kills momentum and draws attention to the writing itself rather than the action.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the descriptive prose is competent, the text is marred by the verbatim repetition of multi-word phrases ("wistfully pragmatic" x3, "instill" x3, "quivering hush" x2, "protected vulnerability" x2). These artifacts read like a checklist being filled, creating significant "template cadence" issues that break the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is competent but tends toward the purple ("exquisitely fragile," "unassailable truth"). The phrase "atomically reflective" creates a jarring tonal anachronism within the established fantasy lexicon ("cloud-leather," "starlight-quartz"). There is a reliance on abstract nouns over concrete verbs to carry emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjectival clutter and clichéd pairings like "trembling hope" and "gentle ripple." The repetition of "prismatic" and "prisms" in the opening paragraph creates a slight lexical loop, and "inevitably whimsical" reads as a forced modifier insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is competent and rhythmic, but marred by stock imagery ("clenched fists," "bloomed like flowers," "tears traced clean paths"). These clichés weaken the emotional impact of otherwise solid line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is functional but suffers from adjective stuffing and clichés ("panic clawed at her throat," "cold sweat"). The density of descriptors slows momentum ("silent malice," "quiet defiance," "silent tapestry"). There are no major mechanical errors, but the reliance on standard phrasing limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by cliché ("pulse stilled," "choked breath") and telling ("surgical reverence"). The descriptor "miraculously preserved" highlights a lack of invention in justifying the plot's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but marred by awkward phrasing ("reversible exile waiting for proof") and adjective stacking ("nervously confident resolve"). The pacing is uneven, with the climax summarized rapidly ("Sirens wailed... station emptied"), and the ending relies on abstract summary over concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=2.7)
    The prose is dense with "purple" abstractions ("luminous disbelief," "sculpt possibility") and clunky constructions ("His dynamically observant nature cataloged"). The integration of required phrases disrupts the rhythm and feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density and cliché phrasing ("Dusk bled indigo," "meteoric rise," "echoes of ambition"). The reliance on "purple" descriptors gilds the scene rather than revealing it through sharp, fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but tends toward overwriting and somatic clichés ("tears welled," "breath caught," "trembling hands") that flatten the emotional impact. The density of adjectives and "telling" phrases ("profound peace settled") slows the narrative momentum during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pervasive purple prose and adjective stacking ("malevolent grace," "liquid light," "mocking ripples") severely clutter the narrative and stall momentum. Mixed metaphors ("blade before the strike" vs. "unbending") and abstract nouns dilute line-level clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from "template cadence" and phrase looping, specifically the quadruple repetition of "purposefully curious" and "anxious elation." These repetitions read as forced insertions rather than organic description. The style is also overwrought ("bleeding violet," "tremor in her marrow"), reducing clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant repetitive artifacts degrade the reading experience; specific phrases ("fiercely gentle," "inlaying meaning everywhere," "trammel") appear multiple times verbatim, creating a mechanical, checklist-like rhythm. These loops halt momentum and indicate a lack of lexical control, heavily penalizing the score.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from metaphor mixing ("facts was a brick in a wall against the tidal wave") and cliché ("clinging like a shroud," "mocking applause"). The reliance on abstract nouns and diagnostic statements to convey emotion ("profound calm," "quiet resolve") reduces immediacy and density.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is functional and rhythmic but marred by several stock phrases and clichés ("despair threatened to swallow him whole," "tears traced clean paths"). While the imagery of the arbor is strong, the emotional beats rely on familiar descriptors that blunt the line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is polished but overwritten, relying heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("gentle gold," "steadfast flame"). The dialogue and internal monologue regarding the shards ("The desert is a sea of emptiness") lean into cliché and lack specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from abstract adjective-noun pairings ("compassionate brilliance," "inherent truth," "palpable vibration") that dilute imagery. The writing is polished but dense with sentimentality, lacking the sharp, concrete economy required for top-tier literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally competent but relies on high-density figurative language that sometimes tells rather than shows ("trembled with meaning"). The repetition of "daringly methodical" creates a clumsy rhythmic artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetitive phrasing and scaffold artifacts; "unfolding cipher," "propagation delays," and "cyclically reversed" each appear three times in a short text. "Cautious exuberance" is used verbatim twice as a label. These repetitions, alongside clichés like "symphony of human experience," damage the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.8)
    The specific phrase "perforated destiny" is repeated four times in a short span, and "mulberry" appears six times, creating a noticeable repetitive cadence. These text artifacts, along with the forced insertion of "mulberry ache" as an emotional label, disrupt the prose flow and feel mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose rhythm is disrupted by scaffolded sentence stems ("Her motivation was," "Her method was") that tell rather than show. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("radiant hush," "fluid certainty," "sacred anticipation") creates a dense, purple texture that obscures the action's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is dense with adjectival clutter and mixed metaphors ("liquid metronome," "tangled threads," "raw material of memory"). The phrase "vineyard hush" is repeated awkwardly. The text tells rather than shows, relying on abstractions to convey physical and emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose leans on "telling" via abstract metaphors ("cloak of doubt," "wall of gruffness") instead of showing through concrete action. There is a tendency toward purple phrasing ("deep indigo silence") that slows momentum without adding density.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm is competent, but the text relies heavily on cliché clusters ("luminous clarity," "liquid silver") and adjective stacking ("profound and gentle hush") that dilute the prose's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but overwritten, relying heavily on "noun of noun" constructions ("canyon of endless echoes," "chorus of memory") and standard fantasy phrasings ("sharp cry split the air"). The specific phrasing "historically reverent to his marrow" is notably clunky and misuses the modifier, disrupting the otherwise smooth rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished, but the repetitive use of the prompt word "unstrap" (unstrapped shame, unstrapped expectations, unstrapped keystone, unstrapped bindings) becomes a distracting artifact. The density of imagery is good, though it occasionally drifts into "telling" to support the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.5)
    While there is some strong imagery, the prose is marred by mechanical, expository phrasing that exposes the story's structure (e.g., "The action of closing the logbook began to signify a profound shift"). These lines read as functional bridges between prompt requirements rather than organic storytelling, significantly disrupting the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally competent but suffers from scaffolding ("She employed her method," "She knew the necessary action") and awkward conceptual phrasing ("to wavelength align" as a verb phrase). While imagery is often nice, the reliance on abstract nouns ("integrity," "resonance," "continuum") dilutes the physical immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from abstract metaphors ("facets reflecting truth," "tears of pure energy") and "telling" emotional states ("named dread given substance"). The ritual sequence falls into a repetitive syntactic cadence (Name -> Light -> Transformation) that feels templated. These artifacts weaken the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.3)
    Significant repetitive artifacts mar the prose, including the phrase "brittle devotion" appearing four times and "earnestly naive" twice, reading like forced prompt-insertions. Additionally, the clumsy repetition in "hollow victory... village’s hollow silence" and abstract phrasing ("tangible symptom of cosmic imbalance") reduce line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mechanically clean, but the prose suffers from adjectival clutter and abstract noun phrases ("irrevocable loss," "sterile inventory") that drag on momentum. The reliance on "telling" constructions ("The sight unlocked a forgotten memory") reduces immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is saturated with "purple" artifacts and clichés ("liquid prism," "shimmering veil," "living inkblot"). Excessive use of filter verbs ("intuition felt," "soul whispered") and abstract noun constructions obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.3)
    Line-level craft is marred by awkward forced phrasing ("Attentively inventive, she noted") and redundancies ("remembering through muscle memory"). The phrase "soundless echo" appears twice, and the prose relies on adjective-heavy construction that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant repetitive artifacts appear with variations of "history rewrote itself" occurring four times (lines 5, 9, 14, 23). The prose relies heavily on abstract noun piles ("grief," "joy," "peace") rather than concrete, sensory particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose suffers from high density of cliché metaphors and abstract descriptors ("liquid metaphor," "symbols whispered on the wind"). The writing calls attention to itself with poeticisms that obscure the physical reality of the moment (e.g., "humming with crickets and possibility").

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive artifacting, using the specific phrases "macerate" and "mournfully eager" three times each in a short space. This apparent "prompt-stuffing" creates a robotic cadence that disrupts the narrative flow and draws attention to the artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is competent but suffers from overwriting and adjective stacking ("deep, sorrowful brown," "feeble sun bled watery orange"). Abstract noun phrases ("profound dimensional homesickness," "visceral wave") often replace concrete depiction, slowing the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is overwritten with frequent modification ("stoically sensitive nature," "meticulous notes") and relies on telling over showing. The use of a cliché idiom ("penny dropped") at the pivotal moment undermines the established atmospheric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but leans heavily on adjectival density ("star-dusted," "serenely electric," "luminous pearl"), bordering on purple. The flow is good, but the reliance on abstract descriptors softens the impact of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is functional but cluttered with modifiers and abstract nouns ("resiliently positive spirit," "burning ember") that slow momentum. The writing tells rather than shows, summarizing emotional states and realizations instead of letting them play out through concrete behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is dense with adjective-noun pairings ("singular motivation," "quiet reverence") and lacks verb energy. The climatic imagery is overwrought ("river of flowing time, thick with the scent of old paper"), obscuring the action with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.3)
    Prose is overwritten with adjectival clutter ("cold, pitted iron," "fragile civilization," "gentle, star-born light") and abstract telling ("grief and wonder fused into purpose"). The awkward adverbial construction "balancedly" appears twice, signaling a forced integration of requirements that harms flow.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is weighted down by adjective-noun pairings ("fragile echoes," "urgent tenderness," "absolute certainty") that tell rather than show. While rhythmic, the density of modifiers and abstract descriptors creates a layer of "writing" that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from abstract metaphors ("drumbeat of closure," "serpent of claustrophobia") and telling ("alchemical marvel... tracked invisible things") that distance the reader. Clichés like "eternal rhythm" and "metronome" reduce freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high abstraction ("release given physical form," "gritty testament to fragility"). There is a tendency to "tell" significance through adjectives rather than showing it through concrete action. The reliance on metaphorical descriptors occasionally obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong sensory imagery like "gleaming copper filaments" and "skeletal cathedrals." Momentum is generally good, though the prompt-forced phrasing creates a minor rhythmic stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose relies heavily on stock phrasing and clichés ("knuckles white," "breath hitched," "joyful abandon," "reputation in tatters," "tears tracing clean paths"). These artifacts flatten the emotional impact. The density of adverbs and adjective-noun pairings reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose flow is severely hampered by the repetitive, forced insertion of prompt phrases; "resonantly soft" appears four times in a short space, creating a mechanical distraction. While the imagery is often strong, these artifacts disrupt the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant modifier congestion and "telling." Phrases like "meticulous care," "solemn precision," "quiet revolution," and "malevolent red" rely on adjective-noun pairing rather than strong verbs. This overwriting slows momentum and clutters the imagery with interpretive labels.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.5)
    Severe repetitive artifacts mar the prose; the phrase "whispering gleam" appears four times and "misting hush" three times in a short text. This redundant phrasing, combined with high adjectival density, creates a halting rhythm and feels like a checklist rather than natural description.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished and grammatically clean but suffers from abstraction ("vessel of pure analog memories," "emotional resonance") and occasional clichés ("tears welled," "gentle weight"). The writing tells emotions rather than evoking them through concrete imagery or action.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting, relying on abstract noun phrases ("cipher of longing," "luminous absence," "ritual of hope") and clichés ("tears traced clean paths"). This density of modifiers and metaphors blurs the physical action and stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is overwritten, saturated with abstract nouns and "purple" adjective-noun pairings ("profound fear," "tender idea," "quiet light"). Mixed metaphors ("disorienting balm") and oxymoronic labels ("unassumingly bold") weaken clarity and density.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose rhythm is generally smooth, but the text relies on telling ("His motivation was pure") and repetitive labeling ("chronic curiosity"). High information density is present, but emotional beats are often summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-level craft is competent with some striking imagery, but it suffers from overwriting and abstract phrasing ("absence has geometry," "fossil of potential"). These constructions slow momentum and prioritize sounding profound over clarity of action.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with adjectival padding ("specific, luminous gold-green," "fragile gold") and abstract metaphors. Several prompt phrases are pasted in as scaffold sentences ("This precise moment, upon the hush...") rather than integrated into the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.5)
    A repetitive sentence scaffold in the second paragraph ("Her motivation was...", "The action required was...", "The method was precise...") reads like a checklist. While the descriptive prose is polished, the reliance on adjectival density and abstract nouns ("lucid unrest") slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.9)
    While the vocabulary is polished, the prose relies heavily on a repetitive "not X but Y" sentence structure (6 instances, e.g., "not void but vessel," "not a flaw but a threshold"). This rhetorical template becomes a distracting artifact that flattens the rhythm and rhetorical impact.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is weighed down by adjectival clutter and clichés ("crushing silence," "piercing gloom," "frozen stars"). Sentence structures are repetitive (Subject-Verb openers), and the integration of prompt phrases often results in awkward, mixed metaphors ("untangling threads of corrosion and narrative").

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is overwritten, heavily relying on adjectives and forced distinct phrases like "driftingly alert" and "tinkersong wonder" (used twice). These text artifacts disrupt the rhythm and read as prompt insertions rather than organic descriptions, reducing line-level clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the prose is competent, it relies heavily on abstract telling ("profound affectionate detachment," "irrevocably altered") instead of concrete action. These emotive labels dilute the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers significantly from repetitive insertion of prompt phrases in the closure. The line "dusty starlight that dusted the heavens" is tautological, and the threefold repetition of "quietly explosive" reads as a scaffold artifact rather than organic characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mechanically clean with strong imagery, but marred by abstract telling ("revelation bloomed," "rewritten her understanding"). There is a reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("profound hush") and filter verbs ("she detected," "she understood") that dulls immediacy. The prose explains the experience as much as it depicts it.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from reliance on clichés ("tears welled," "pulse quickened") and adverb-heavy telling ("diligently curious"). There are several instances of oxymoronic pairings ("sociable isolation," "captive ember") that feel ornamental. The writing explains metaphors immediately after presenting them.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but dense with "thesaurus-itis" and metaphor clutter; the "driftwood" imagery feels forced within the cloud/sky setting. Emotional transitions are often summarized in abstract noun phrases rather than shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is dense with adjectives and strained metaphors ("hope felt brambled," "thorns of uncertainty") that obscure rather than clarify. The repetition of the prompt phrase "brambled hope" as a literal descriptor twice weakens the line-level craft. The rhythm is often sluggish due to heavy modification of nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with modifiers, obstructing immediacy. Phrases like "dusk bled violet," "weeping salt tears," and "tenderized by the sorrow" create a surplus of figurative language that feels melodramatic. Pruning the adjectives would sharpen the imagery significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in nearly every sentence. The repetition of "offhandedly exact" serves as a structural motif, tying the action to the thematic conclusion effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés ("poignant soundtrack," "suffocating storm") and abstract telling ("fundamental clarity"). Overwriting and heavy modification dilute the impact of the imagery and stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is polished but frequently overwritten ("deliberate organic chaos," "liquid shadows"), prioritizing adjectival density over narrative propulsion. The repetition of prompt phrases ("mindfully scattered," "glimmering parole") creates visible artifacts that break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant line-level flaws exist, including the redundancy "emotions were emotionally contagious" and the repetitive use of the "sandpaper" metaphor (three times). The metaphor density mixes vehicles (cartography, sandpaper, cooking, glass) to the point of clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from heavy adjectival modification and noticeable repetition of mandated phrases ("vigorous yet tender," "vigorous tender chaos," "vigorous tender art") which creates a stuttering, artificial rhythm. "Empathetically decisive" acts as a 'tell' that shortcuts characterization, and the density of metaphorical language ("Classical Arabic vowels flowing like oil") occasionally obscures the immediate action. The line-level craft prioritizes ornamentation over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from significant "telling" and abstraction ("potential revelations," "synaptic plasticity"). Additionally, the verbatim repetition of unique phrases ("quaking reverie" and "chaotically precise") constitutes a jarring lexical echo that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is purple and overwritten, dense with adjective-noun pairings ("interlocking truths," "geological whispers") that slow momentum. The required phrases ("clandestinely luminous," "latent blaze") are inserted awkwardly, creating visible text artifacts that clash with the surrounding flow. The density of figurative language obscures rather than clarifies the action.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from heavy adjective/adverb modification ("gentle, persistent," "sorrowful," "silent," "profound," "fragile") and sentimental clichés ("tears traced silent paths"). Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a subject-verb-modifier pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose leans heavily on adjectives and "purple" descriptors ("sky bleeding," "crystalline chime," "serene certainty"), reducing impact. A template cadence emerges in the middle section (repeated "He [verb]..." structures) that creates a mechanical rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting, relying on purple phrasing ("whispered apologies to slammed doors," "ghost of a tear") and adjective stuffing that slows momentum. Metaphors are often mixed or melodramatic ("thawing heart," "tapestry of love and loss"), and the density of sentimentality obscures the concrete physical action. The writing draws attention to its own effort rather than the story it attempts to tell.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.9)
    Line-level craft is functional but weighed down by abstract metaphors and awkward phrasing necessitated by the prompt elements. The brevity forces a summary mode that prevents information density or rhythmic propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is competent but suffers from "purple" tendencies and adjective-noun stacking ("forgotten stone tears," "luminous ribbons," "emerald waves"). This density of ornamentation slows momentum without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("hazy precision" bookends the story) and some purple descriptors ("liquid mercury shadows," "frayed by violence"). The repetition of the phrase "singular convergence" acts as a scaffold that disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, with a high density of adjectives and adverbs that clutter the imagery ("crystalline cerulean blue," "patient cold"). Clichéd phrasing like "tears of joy froze on her cheeks" and "spirit soaring" weakens the emotional impact. The rhythm is static, lacking the variance needed to build momentum during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose quality is marred by the repetitive, awkward modifier "avalanchingly quiet" (used three times) and the grammatical break "action of uncase." These artifacts, combined with some abstract "purple" description ("sonic architecture," "vibrant weave"), reduce line-level clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is polished but dense with abstract nouns and "therapy-speak" labels in peak beats ("transposed empathy," "chaotic variable"). The reliance on telling ("Panic rose, metallic and sharp") over showing stalls momentum during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is weighed down by adjectival clutter, melodramatic phrasing ("silent tears freezing on his cheeks"), and expository scaffolding ("This was the method..."). The reliance on abstract nouns and telling over showing dilutes the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the imagery is clear, the prose suffers from abstract summaries ("underwent a profound transformation") and filter verbs. The reliance on "telling" the emotional shifts distances the reader from the immediate experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from low information density and high adjective/adverb reliance ("profoundly wistful," "latent sacrifice"). Abstract metaphors ("weaving silence into a vessel") often obscure rather than clarify the action. The required phrase "stoically sparkling" is used repetitively and awkwardly.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is weighed down by excessive adjectival modification ("habitual quietness," "quietly determined resolve," "deliberate purpose") which stifles momentum. Repetitive phrasing (the word "deliberate" appears four times; "azure" five times) and filter verbs ("Kael felt," "he knew") create a dense, opaque texture that distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished and readable, but relies on adjective-heavy descriptions and some clichés ("tears tracing paths"). The integration of the required phrase "cyclically spontaneous" is awkward within the narrative flow, creating a minor stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from a density of stock literary metaphors ("heart heavy as fog," "silence... physical weight"). The line "danced like forgotten promises" is a notable instance of abstraction that weakens the visual immediacy. The craftsmanship is solid, but the reliance on familiar poetic tropes limits the freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive phrasing ("shadowed elation" x3, "ancient shadows" x3, "otherworldly routine" x2), creating distracting text artifacts. Adjective stacking in the opening paragraph slows momentum, and the reliance on labeled emotions reduces the immediacy of the line-level experience.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and abstract nouns, occasionally drifting into purple territory ("vivid as a shard of fallen sky"). A specific repetitive artifact weakens the writing: the root "explosive/exploded" appears three times in abstract contexts ("quietly explosive," "silently exploded"), reducing lexical impact.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but heavily adjectival and "purple" ("liquid silver," "benevolent gaze," "alchemized"). This decorative style reduces immediacy and results in abstract descriptions of the magical process rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.4)
    While the imagery is polished, the prose suffers significantly from the clumsy, formulaic insertion of prompt requirements ("This light held the attribute to..."). These structural artifacts read like a checklist being filled out mid-sentence, severely damaging the literary flow and suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from overwritten metaphors and zeugmas ("stained with ink and empathy," "hidden beneath floorboard and regret") that draw attention to the writing rather than the story. These abstractions obscure the physical action, and the reliance on prompt phrases ("enlarged tranquility") results in unnatural diction that disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from "adjective stuffing" and abstract metaphor pile-ups ("gentle insurgency of hope," "baptism of sorrow") that obscure clarity. The phrase "heuristically gentle precision" is a diction artifact that clashes with the surrounding text, and telling replaces showing throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetition artifacts damage the prose; specific phrases like "gently meticulous" (3x), "luminous" (3x), and "quartz hush" (2x) appear excessively within the short word count, creating a template-like cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.9)
    The phrase "comforting unease" is repeated four times in a short text, becoming a severe lexical artifact that distracts from the narrative. While there are strong images ("sonic fracture"), this repetition and occasional purple phrasing lower the technical execution.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.5)
    The phrase "terrestrially cosmic" is repeated three times in a short text (lines 120, 235, 297), creating a distracting artifact that feels like a forced checklist item rather than organic prose. Additionally, the word "lavender" appears five times, contributing to a sense of lexical stagnation despite the otherwise lush description.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is overwritten, heavily relying on adjective stacks and abstract metaphors ("breath tasting of... resolve"). High repetition of specific words ("crystal/crystalline" ~9 times, "auroral" 3 times) and filter verbs ("memory surfaced") creates significant drag.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished with strong sensory imagery ("wilting like parched vines"), though some phrases lean toward cliché ("ancient bone," "stone groaned"). Sentence rhythm is controlled, though the density of "writerly" adjectives occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but overwritten, heavily relying on adjective-noun pairings ("perpetual quietude," "elegant inevitability") that slow momentum. Abstract phrases like "symphonies of truth" and "chords of memory" obscure the concrete reality of the sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished but suffers from visible prompt-patching (e.g., "This was the action of miniaturize" is syntactically awkward). The writing leans into adjectival density ("fragile bubble," "strangely organic grace") that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.8)
    Writing leans on abstract nominalizations ("cumulative grace," "tapestry of reconciliation") that distance the reader from concrete action. The line-level logic often falters for the sake of a pretty image, such as the physically impossible presence of the new letter or the misuse of the sandstorm metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "purple" tendencies (e.g., "seismic in the watery gloom," "clarity bloomed"). High metaphor density sometimes obscures the action, and the reliance on abstract descriptors ("unbreakable strength," "quiet triumph") reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition artifacts undermine the prose; the specific phrase "gleaming silence" appears three times (lines 3, 120, 268), and forms of "silent/silence" appear eight times in a short text. This lexical churn suggests a lack of editorial polish.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing and heavy-handed modifiers ("terrestrially cosmic" appears three times; "smoothed hush" and "tranquil blaze" are also looped). The reliance on abstract metaphors ("liquid lullaby," "motes of light") results in a "purple" texture that obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.4)
    The mandatory attribute ("patiently nimble") is repeated three times in short succession, creating a jarring rhythmic artifact that feels like a template insertion. While the rest of the prose is functional, this repetition and occasional purple phrasing ("ephemeral lines") disrupt the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is overwritten, suffering from adjective stuffing ("silent, beautiful fragment") and clichéd metaphors ("fragile yet unyielding as spider silk"). The specific phrase "tragically radiant" acts as a repetitive artifact, appearing twice without rhetorical justification, and the reliance on abstract emotional labeling ("crushing isolation") weakens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from reliance on clichés ("frozen tears," "thick as velvet") and purple description ("pearl twilight," "dove and silver"). Emotional states are often told through abstract nouns rather than shown through concrete imagery or action.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.6)
    Prose is marred by the repetitive use of clunky phrases ("reed-blown melancholy" x2, "whispering seashell half" x3) and the forced insertion of prompt terms. The text relies on "telling" via heavy modifiers rather than concrete, active verbs to convey emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and adjective stuffing ("slumped like a frozen tear," "swirling crystalline blizzard"). This density of figurative language in nearly every sentence creates a "purple" texture that obscures the action and reduces emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=2.8)
    Significant text-artifact penalties apply for the repetitive looping of prompt phrases; "whispering parapet," "hidden effort," "demure audacity," and "scintillatingly somber" each appear 3–4 times in ~350 words. The prose is dense with adverbs and abstractions ("scintillatingly somber glow," "liquid affirmation") that obscure the image. Momentum stalls under the weight of explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished, with good information density. The score is limited by abstract phrasing at the climax ("crystalline moment," "quiet affirmation") and the summary handling of the letter reassembly, which glosses over physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is dense with "telling" and abstract metaphors ("river of metaphor," "seeds tossed into the wind") that obscure the physical reality of the scene. The reliance on summary for pivotal moments robs the story of momentum and line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is severely marred by the verbatim repetition of complex phrases ("positively wistful" appears three times; "lonesome splendor" and "gleaned redemption" twice), which reads like a mechanical glitch or forced prompt insertion. The writing leans heavily into purple prose ("bled from indigo," "sacred method") and adjective stuffing.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and adjective stuffing (e.g., "fleeting golden sunset," "molten amber and rose," "gilded haze" in one sentence). The density of modifiers and explicit definitions of concepts ("This was sonic absolution") stalls momentum and reduces line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mechanical insertion of prompt elements creates clunky, expository syntax ("making this object, the magnetic viaduct after rain, her indispensable key") that breaks immersion. The repetition of "softly purposeful" and reliance on abstract adjectives ("ethereal," "profound") clutter the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose relies on abstract metaphors and clichés ("ghost of desperation," "emotional turbulence," "instrument of control") that distance the reader from the immediate physical reality. Several filter verbs ("she felt," "she recalled") dampen the immediacy of the "entangled memories" sequence. "Fortified vulnerability" appears as an awkward prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant lexical repetition damages the prose; the complex phrase "aptly deliberate" appears twice (paras 8 and 16), and the word "silent" appears four times (twice in one sentence). These artifacts suggest a lack of line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose relies on clichés ("breath caught," "threw her head back," "tears cutting clean paths") and heavy modification ("steadily curious," "impossible precision"). While the imagery is dense, the rhythm is frequently dampened by adjectival clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose suffers from clichés ("breath caught," "tears traced") and "telling" constructions ("brightly attentive nature") that dilute immediacy. Some lines strain for poetic effect ("threads catching the low light like a promise") resulting in overwriting that distracts from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is cluttered with adjectives ("shadow-laced," "calmly intuitive," "silent, violent crack," "soft, living shadows") that slow momentum. Heavy scaffolding ("Their motivation was," "This synthesis defined") replaces active storytelling with exposition. The prompt phrases are inserted verbatim as labels, disrupting the natural flow of the sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose suffers from tautology ("wind carrying a windborne solace"), cliché ("deep-throated groan," "grief-shadowed eyes"), and abstract similes ("like a forgotten truth"). The density of "tell-y" metaphors blocks immersion and creates a filter between reader and action.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is dense with mixed metaphors ("voice... woven with the rustle") and high-flown abstractions ("shrouded in absolute vacancy"). A jarring register break occurs when academic phrasing ("intersubjective understanding") appears in emotional dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is polished but decorative, suffering from high adjective density ("infinitesimal," "crystalline," "unwaveringly") and familiar similes ("drawn like iron to a magnet"). The writing prioritizes "poetic" sounding phrases over muscular, active syntax, reducing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and adjective-stacking ("perceptively calm grace," "fragrant purple sanctuary," "fragile black-and-white photographs"). "Emerald tapestries" and "threads of starlight" drift into purple prose that obscures rather than reveals. Filter verbs ("Elara observed," "she understood") distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns and adjectives ("profound quiet," "palpable, waiting stillness") and clichés ("Tears traced clean paths through dust"). There is a lack of information density; sentences often restate the atmospheric mood without advancing the narrative. The repetition of the phrase "weathered innocence" acts as a scaffold artifact rather than a resonant motif.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from a high density of abstract adjective-noun pairings ("profound hush," "sacred act," "infinite tenderness") and filtering that tells the reader how to feel. There is a tendency to rely on "purple" descriptors and mixed metaphors ("motivation burned with tidal longing") rather than concrete imagery. Verbatim insertion of prompt phrases disrupts the flow and reads as artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but heavily reliant on emotive clichés ("alarms flashed crimson for three heartbeats," "tears traced warm paths"). While rhythmically competent, the density of abstract adjectives ("traumatized heart," "mechanical vertigo") occasionally obscures the concrete action, prioritizing sound over distinct visual or tactile sense.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose suffers from significant purple overwriting ("quiet certainty of deep water," "hymning the mundane") and awkward phrasing ("the action of reunify bloomed"). Adjective stacking ("decisively kind eyes") and strained metaphors ("unresolved sheet music") clutter the sentences and reduce clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the prose has strong evocative moments, the verbatim repetition of the phrase "quietly deliberate" (lines 69, 128, 296) constitutes a significant text artifact/loop. This redundancy disrupts the flow and mars an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from "purple" tendencies, relying on abstract nouns and heavy adjectival strings ("shrewdly innocent precision," "nostalgic innovation"). Metaphors are frequent and sometimes mixed, prioritizing poetic sound over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.2)
    Several sentences are contorted to fit prompt elements ("performed the deliberate action of weigh"), resulting in grammatical awkwardness and static rhythm. Adjective stacking and abstract nouns ("increasingly reflectively vibrant") clutter the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is overwritten with a high density of adjective-noun pairings ("emerald moss," "honeyed shafts," "monolithic mainframe") that slows momentum. The narrative frequently pauses to explain the symbolism of an image immediately after presenting it.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.0)
    Severe repetition of prompt terms degrades the prose; "cameo" appears eight times, and "solemnized" and "current" are overused to the point of distraction. "Lucidly watchful" is repeated verbatim as a sentence opener twice, creating a template-cadence artifact that flattens the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, relying on cliché ("dewdrops... like scattered diamonds," "dawn bled," "world holding its breath") and adjective stacking. This "purple" style reduces information density and momentum, obscuring the action behind a layer of ornamental description.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjectival density and abstract metaphors ("skeletal testament," "needle of pure potential") that drift into purple prose. This overwriting slows momentum and blunts the impact of the stronger, more concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from "telling" (summarizing motivation and work) and cliché ("liquid starlight," "dancing dust motes"). The ending mixes metaphors ("heart a cellar") in a way that feels overwritten rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative, with strong imagery like "shingled hush." The score is held back by the awkward insertion of the prompt phrase "boundary-lessly trapped," which disrupts the rhythm, and a slight tendency toward abstract description over concrete action in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is polished but dense with abstract summarization and filter verbs ("understood," "recalled," "knew"). The reliance on telling ("Her motivation was clear") inhibits immediacy and creates distance from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose rhythm is steady, but the text suffers from abstract noun stacks and summary-as-action ("Negotiation unfolded as integration"). Over-reliance on "was" constructions and told attributes ("resolute spirit") weakens immediacy and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant repetitive looping occurs with the phrase "redirected flow(s)," which appears four times in the latter half, dulling the prose. The explicit insertion of prompt terms results in unnatural phrasing ("functionally creative attribute") that disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetitive artifacts mar the prose; specific phrases like "excruciatingly gentle/gently" (4x), "petrichor" (4x), and "glacial hush" (3x) appear with distracting frequency in a short space. These repetitions read as forced prompt insertions rather than organic writing, shattering immersion and triggering the artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is dense with adjectives and metaphors that often border on cliché ("groaning... like a shared sigh," "forged in the fires"). Key phrases from the prompt ("thoughtfully clear," "serene upheaval") are repeated or inserted awkwardly, disrupting natural syntax. The writing tells the reader how to feel rather than evoking the sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is weakened by a significant grammar error ("action of coax its location"), heavy adjectival scaffolding, and clichés ("face was a map of wind and water").

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is competent but suffers from "purple" tendencies and high metaphor density ("skeletal branches etched against a bruised sky," "crunched like shattered stained glass") that distance the reader. Clichés like "tears traced warm paths" and "eyes holding deep, weathered kindness" reduce freshness. The reliance on adjective-heavy description slows the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from high-fantasy clichés ("tears traced clean paths through grime," "spider-silk at sunrise") and heavy-handed metaphor usage. The integration of prompt phrases occasionally results in awkward syntax, such as "hypothesized the core concept of flawed genesis."

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is dense with abstract metaphors and "purple" phrasing that violates the "show, don't tell" principle ("scented of resilience," "liquid strokes"). This density of figurative language distracts from the action and reduces line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from severe artifacts, including spacing errors like "unstick ed" and "unstick ing," likely resulting from forced prompt integration. The rigid repetition of complex adjective-noun phrases clutters the sentence structure and kills momentum. Line-level craft is functional at best but frequently broken by these mechanical flaws and cliché-ridden descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetitive artifacts mar the prose, including the quadruple use of "troubling serenity" and the nonsensical repetition of "petals" in the second sentence. Clichés ("tears of joy") and forced refrain insertions disrupt the syntax and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is competent but suffers from adjectival saturation ("quiet breath," "soft luminescence," "gentle authority") and mixed metaphors ("scars of granite and grief"). The density of "purple" descriptors slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.2)
    Line-level craft is marred by clumsy usage of prompt terms and abstract "telling" constructions (e.g., "The action of emergence was clarity"). Repetitive phrasing of the attribute ("ethically diligent nature," "ethically diligent focus") weakens the prose significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe text-artifact loops are present; "tenderly organized" appears three times (lines 7, 18, 22) and "velveteen gloom" twice, creating a stuttering, template-like effect. The prose is dense with modifiers but lacks propulsion, relying on synonym churn rather than fresh action.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose contains several clichés ("threads woven into a tapestry," "hope's lightning") and leans into purple description ("shard of solidified night") that distracts from the action. While visually evocative in places, the reliance on abstract nouns and adjectival stacking reduces narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from a recurring "adjective-adjective noun" artifact ("slow, orange heartbeat," "silent, swallowing mist," "fragile, urgent whispers," "soft, spectral green light") that creates a repetitive, rhythmic scaffolding. This density of modification slows momentum and feels overwritten in places. While the imagery is strong, the reliance on stacked modifiers to generate texture detracts from the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from scaffolding artifacts (e.g., "performed the action of powdering") and heavy-handed imagery ("melancholy snow"). The reliance on abstract nouns and adverbs to convey weight dilutes the immediacy of the physical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, but the text relies on abstract telling ("symbolized empirical truth," "rationally rebellious") over concrete showing. A paraphrase loop occurs with "counter-narrative" and "competing narrative" in close proximity. The "agony" beat is delivered as a label rather than a visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from the repetitive, forced insertion of specific phrases ("expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness," "denote/denoted"), which appear multiple times in identical forms, creating a "template cadence" artifact. These repetitions read as compliance mechanisms rather than narrative choices, breaking the immersive quality of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is weighed down by metaphorical summaries ("pruned despair") and explanatory telling that saps momentum. The misuse of the scientific term "synaptic plasticity" as a magical mechanic creates a jarring register artifact that disrupts the established atmospheric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is competent but suffers from adjective stacking and slightly purple descriptors ("liquid gold," "rare alchemy," "profound silence"). While readable, the density of modifiers slows momentum without adding necessary texture.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and the use of stock clichés such as "liquid gold," "time itself seemed to hold its breath," and "tears traced warm paths." The density of figurative language often obscures the action, and the phrasing occasionally becomes clumsy (e.g., the noun pile-up in "creeping normality noticer").

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is weighed down by "telling" and repetitive abstract phrasing ("nuance" and "certainty" appear four times each). The specific prompt phrase "incisively kind" is used twice as a modifier, reading as a repetitive artifact rather than an integrated trait.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose suffers from awkward phrasing ("balancedly daring" is clunky and repeated) and clichés ("perfectly imperfect," "shattering glass"). The reliance on abstract adjectives ("profound ache," "sacred constant") reduces the textural impact of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is dense with adverbs and adjective-noun pairings ("methodically hopeful precision," "visceral warmth," "reverent care") that clutter the rhythm. Clichéd phrasings ("tears traced clean paths through city grime") and abstract telling ("profound confirmation") weaken the line-level impact. The reliance on synesthesia ("saffron quiet") feels forced rather than organic to the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from "telling" artifacts (e.g., "Elara, profoundly historically oriented") and intrusive explanation of metaphors ("The necessary thaw was dual"). High adjective density and mixed imagery ("rosewater dread") clutter the line-level execution, reducing momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant lexical repetition indicates a lack of polish: "profound" appears three times, "quiet" three times (desperation, ferocity, defiance), and "neatly inventive" and "bleak exhilaration" are repeated verbatim. These echoing artifacts suggest a scaffolded draft rather than finished literary prose.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is weighed down by cliché similes ("nails on glass," "smoke in a breeze") and forced integration of required words ("unbosom the very essence"). The density of adjectives ("faint, persistent glow," "sickly greenish light") slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is severely hampered by the clumsy, repetitive inclusion of the phrase "fractal generating," which appears four times in awkward syntactic structures. This creates a distinct text artifact that degrades line-level quality and flow.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "purple" overwriting and dense abstraction (e.g., "syntactic verb in the gate’s silent sentence," "liquid light"). While the rhythm is generally good, these metaphors sometimes obscure the physical reality of the scene rather than sharpening it. The "merciless white disc" opening is a bit standard.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is weighed down by cliché ("suffocating pit of lies," "comforting blanket") and excessive adjective-noun pairings ("moss-crusted," "emerald silence"). The repetition of the phrase "emotionally rational" acts as a scaffold artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with abstract metaphors ("mud met memory") and suffers from severe repetition of prompt phrases ("hushed blaze" appears five times). Adjectival clutter ("stoically sensitive grace") weakens the line-level impact. The repetition of specific phrases creates a mechanical, scaffolded rhythm that distracts from the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant artifacts, including a visible text glitch or placeholder ("clear凹 impression") in the climax that breaks immersion. Heavy repetition of specific phrases ("reclaimed stillness", "dappled resolve", "tranquilly perceptive") creates a scaffolded, checklist-like quality that deadens the rhythm. Phrasing often prioritizes ornamental adjectives over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns (grief, solace, torment, resolve) and repetitive descriptors ("luminous" appears four times). Phrasing like "dampened by tears and resolve" strains for poetic effect but lands as melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is weighed down by oxymorons and clichés ("intangibly tangible," "bleak exhilaration," "grief and grace"). Abstract descriptors replace concrete imagery, and the reliance on "telling" emotional states creates a barrier to immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is competent but overly reliant on adjectives and adverbs ("exquisitely small," "purposeful grace," "reverent surprise") that tell rather than show. The phrase "brilliant dimness" appears twice, feeling forced rather than integrated. Emotion is often summarized ("Kael felt a flicker of warmth") instead of dramatized through physical correlates.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=3.8)
    The text suffers from severe scaffold artifacts; sentences like "The core concept of the sieved hush was..." and "His motivation was..." read as raw data entry. Clichés such as "weight of unspoken words" and "dusk bled" reduce freshness. The prose rhythm is monotonous, driven by declarative explanations.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by the verbatim repetition of the distinct phrase "furrowed hush" (lines 3 and 33), which reads as a clumsy artifact in such a short text. The density of adjectives and metaphors occasionally slows momentum without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is functional but marred by cliché ("guttering like a candle," "standing sentinel") and mixed metaphors ("diamond needle stitching night to day"). Several required elements are inserted as expository phrases ("fueled by a fragile motivation"), disrupting the rhythm. The density of adjectives and sentimental phrasing detracts from the raw impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is mechanically competent but overwritten, leaning on adjective-heavy descriptions ("pristine, silent expanse," "indifferent streets") and standard phrasing ("heart pounding," "shattered business"). The rhythm is generally smooth, though it lacks a distinct textural signature.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from adjective-heavy "purple" descriptions ("moss velvet-soft," "void-chill mint") that prioritize ornamentation over propulsion. The prompt phrase "paradoxically steady" is inserted awkwardly twice, drawing attention to itself as a scaffold rather than an organic description. There is a tendency toward "thesaurus-itis" that clogs the line-level flow without adding distinct informational value.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers from overwriting ("embodied choking beauty") and awkward phrasing forced by the inclusion of specific prompt terms. Metaphors are frequent but sometimes collide or feel decorative ("ink-stained soul"), reducing the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from "purple" tendencies, relying on abstract noun phrases ("latent sorrow," "infinite mercy") and clichés ("sharp shards," "silent velvet"). The density of adjectives and heavy-handed metaphors obscures clarity and slows momentum without adding genuine sensory texture.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is technically functional but suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density ("tapestry of coincidences," "river of living light"). The reliance on abstract nouns and adjective-heavy descriptors ("vibrant silence," "bittersweet joy") reduces immediacy and narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by "telling" constructions ("posture radiating dutiful vigilance," "embodied calmly inventive resolve") and adjectival density. While the pacing is adequate, the reliance on abstract labels to convey emotion distances the reader from the immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose leans on adjective-heavy construction and stock imagery ("liquid mercury," "inner fire"). The climax relies on the "single tear" cliché, and phrases like "thermal sighs" strain for poetic effect without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from high modifier density and metaphorical clutter ("lavender and loss," "dam of composure shattered... tracing new rivers"). The reliance on abstract-concrete pairings and poetic diction ("storm-kissed," "fleeting tableaus") reduces immediacy and reads as overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is polished but marred by "purple" overwriting and cliché ("liquid gold," "deep within her bones"). There is a tendency toward mixed or extended metaphors that clutter the line (the "symphony" of logic and intuition). Word repetition ("fractured/fracturing" in the opening section) and modifier-heavy sentences slow the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is dense with "precious" modifiers and filter verbs ("felt the familiar psychic tremor," "voice warm with pride"), creating a texture that feels suffocating rather than propulsive. While grammatically sound, the reliance on adjective-stuffing ("defiant stars," "granite resolve") reduces the immediacy of the image.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from adjective density and the clumsy repetition of the prompt phrase "steely longing" (used twice as a noun phrase). The insertion of "strategically creative" feels mechanical. These artifacts, along with frequent modifier-noun pairings ("fragile melody," "worn ivory keys"), create a rhythmic monotony that drags on the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is cluttered with repetitive imagery—specifically the "liquid" artifact ("liquid gold," "liquid starlight," "liquid sunlight")—and abstract noun-adjective pairings. These lexical loops and the reliance on "tapestry" and "symphony" metaphors stall momentum and dilute the climax's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with adjective-noun stacking ("soft sun," "salt-kissed breeze," "moss-cushioned stone"), creating a sluggish rhythm. This decorative scaffolding obscures the action and reduces propulsion.

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; high information load packed into participial openers that advance observation (“Kneeling carefully…”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new physical detail or conceptual tilt. Metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent—dust as constellation, decay as tender methodology. Only hairline slip: “needless drama” phrase recurs three times; slight echo but never obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm tracks emotional curve; sentences carry dual duty (action + atmospheric charge). Occasional modifier stacks (“profound hush of a quiet canyon under stars that held their breath”) flirt with overwriting but pattern is taught early and sustained. No loops or scaffold. Closure line is clean, though “spaces between” verges on aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry dual payload—action + emotional hue—without scaffold. Metaphors (indigo grief, liquid gold peace) stay physically coherent inside glass logic. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause advances pigment or stakes. Read-aloud cadence modulates with color tempo; closure line crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality (“slid it into the gutter… a soft pulse of gold”). Figurative language is spare and precise (“edges catching the faint light like a captured star”) without crowding climax. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. No mixed metaphors, no register drift, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances image, pressure, or cadence. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“a single, crystalline note shimmered into the stillness”—never clogging high-pressure beats. Strong verbs (weaved, steadied, kissed) replace modifiers; no mixed metaphors or therapy-speak. Final line earns resonance without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, no filter-verb stacks; sentences advance at least two jobs (image + motion, scent + memory cue). Figurative load is high but patterned and paid off. One clause edges purple (“lavish cascades”) yet doesn’t occlude causality. Closure line is crystalline, no artifact touch.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud cadence varies naturally; no template stems or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense but patterned—every metaphor (ivy tightening, willow warp) recurs to reinforce time-as-organic. One near-miss: “sigh of release” is a mild auditory cliché, yet it passes because the garden literally exhales through leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—only three metaphors in the last beat, each purposeful. One paraphrase loop (“resilience… resilient”) is minor. Information density high; every line advances image or tactic. A single filter verb stack (“felt the iron manacle loosen… felt warm”) is tolerated under emotional release, capping at 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.5)
    Strong nouns and sensory verbs keep momentum; mixed-metaphor risk (“evaporating silence after ‘I will protect you’”) lands without confusion. Repetitive sentence openings (“She...”) create mild drumbeat; no loops or synonym churn. Figurative density peaks at closure but is taught by earlier aurora/choir pattern, so penalty waived. Overall clarity and economy strong enough for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe. Figurative language is selective—one mixed risk: “ivy shimmered like liquid jade” is borderline cliché but passes at this density. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Strong verbs (“spilled,” “traced,” “wove”) replace modifiers. Opening line anchors voice/stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor overwrite: “dying light” and “fleeting golden sunset” redundancy costs −0.2, but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with furnace cycle; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Metaphors (liquid dawn, steel gloom) are sparse, taught early, paid off. High density: “From error, wisdom is forged” compresses arc. Clean grammar, precise tool terminology, zero scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean and double-duty: “feverish betrayal still scorching her veins” conveys temperature and emotion in one stroke. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to staccato climb beats. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances position or stakes. Minor register lift—“re-instrumented”—is justified by Elara’s film-tech background.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Ear-test passes: cadence swells then hushes, mirroring content. Figurative density is high but patterned—each metaphor pays off (flakes = fallen stars, silence = amber resin). No mixed metaphors. Scaffolding minimal: bracketed counts are generation artifacts and ignored. Sentence variety strong; no template cadence. Peak beats (final stroke) are crystal-clear.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“temporal seams,” “melting glass”—never clustering in peak beats. Opening and final lines anchor voice and reverb: frost → stars, prison → sanctuary. One minor scaffold: “seventeen-minute window” is repeated twice in the first 120 words; trimming one would tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is spare but purposeful—“veil of starlight,” “fortress of isolation”—without purple overload. Information density strong: one sentence often layers sensory detail, motive, and world rule. Minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to hold their breath”) but occurs in low-pressure beat; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “emerald curtain,” “maps of veins,” “mending the lie” all serve dual sensory/thematic duty. No synonym loops; only one near-paraphrase (“withered by decades… purpose bloomed”) but it charges the final cadence. Metaphors stay physically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Density high—thermal suit crackle doubles as body and weather; lattice strands replace light show cliché. No mixed metaphors at climax. One passive—“time unveiled itself”—is purposive. Copy clean; no homophones. Final line cadence mirrors earlier “mechanically warm” refrain, recharging it.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is rhythmically alive: fricatives in “floodwater as ink,” bowed open vowels in the held note. Figurative logic stays consistent—water as score, light as pulse. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no scaffold. One near-overwrite: “ghostly silhouette” could trim to “ghost-sheer,” but it does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty—”Sunlight glinted off frost-rimed anemometers, their steady whirring a fragile counterpoint”—advancing atmosphere and stakes. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each image is fresh. One mixed metaphor—”swaying certainties where bedrock conviction once stood”—but it resolves through context. Final paragraph breathes with short declaratives after layered clauses, propelling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean with high density: single sentences layer rust scent, foot placement, and thematic echo. No synonym loops; metaphors stay consistent (eyes, tears, prayer). One mixed metaphor—“hollow urgency…drawn like a moth to flame”—slightly blurs emotional texture. Final bead-click is clean, literal, and resonant; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence variety is deliberate; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors are interwoven (“moss stitch broken flagstones”) yet stay physically coherent. One mixed moment—“planet’s slow, rhythmic pulse” beside “silent symphony”—is minor. Density is high; each line advances image or rule, propelling the quiet descent.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene: cadence slows during eclipse, accelerates after flare. Each sentence carries dual duty—e.g., “Coolness rose from the dreaming roots” advances atmosphere and stakes chill. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Strong verbs—“poured,” “pricked,” “flares”—replace modifiers. Only hairline slip: “ordinary magic” repeated four times; still pattern-taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density—lines carry atmosphere, character, motion simultaneously. One paraphrase loop (“stories walls have heard” echoed twice) keeps it from 9+. Metaphors unified; no mixed vehicles. Final cadence slows to match sealing act, propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. High density: “pressing the cookie dough, sealing wrapper, pacing lantern room” compresses three actions into one beat. Metaphors are coherent—lighthouse as “granite teeth” fits maritime peril, microdot as “brittle relic” bridges spy past to present. Final line’s “steady rhythm of two hearts learning a new melody” avoids cliché by tying back to musical transposition motif established early.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops, no scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are coherent—silence as chapel stone, questions as scalpels—and never mixed. Rhythm breathes: long clauses for incantation, fragments for shockwave beats. Only one register twitch (see Q6) prevents perfect 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or beat. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors in climax, all coherent (“visual metronome,” “root note of belonging”). Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and temporal data. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “unheard note.” No register drift, no mixed vehicles, no simultaneity errors. Proofing clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, motion, or emotional charge. Metaphors are coherent—liquid geometry, crystallized laughter—obeying dream-physics taught early. Rhythm varies from sinuous clauses to the staccato of “I accept all that I am,” mirroring the shift from resistance to release. opening and closing lines are ear-tested for resonance without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear is musical: varied sentence openings, paragraph lengths breathe with escalation. Figurative language is selective—only one metaphor per high-pressure beat, each precise (“ghostly cascade of inverted tones”). Zero paraphrase loops; no synonym churn. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“quiet, beating heart”). One minor scaffold: “the world softened into an audibly muted sanctuary” could trim “audibly,” but it echoes required element so retains thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences perform double duty: "the cool kiss of flagstones beneath her worn boots" advances both tactile setting and bodily vigilance. No paraphrase loops; each image appears once and accrues meaning (gate latch click → sealing fate; anemometer → final emblem). Metaphors are meteorological, consistent, and never mixed. Only a single adjectival stack ("chemically-tinged squall") but it is POV-plausible and does not recur under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “silver veins—a forgotten language of pollination” does triple duty. Varied sentence rhythm; no template cadence runs. One mixed metaphor pair (“whispered secret… world dissolved”) but does not obscure closure. Filter verbs minimal; immediacy preserved through sensory anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm modulates from starlit hush to grit-under-fingernails immediacy; no template cadence or filler-verb stacks. One paraphrase loop (“He felt time’s true texture…/He had learned that discovering time’s texture…”) could be compressed, but it occurs post-closure and does not dull the final image. Otherwise density is high, every sentence doing at least two jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric clauses mimic bow strokes, then a short declarative punch (“She lowered the bow”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds sensorial or causal newness. Figurative language is dense but patterned—ash, silence, resonance interweave without contradiction. One minor scaffold: “magnificent simplicity” is named twice; the second utterance could be cut, preventing a 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is spare, precise (“fossilized resin walls glowed like captured sunset”) and never congests high-pressure beats. Information density high—e.g., “static electricity translated the petal’s story into sensory echoes” compresses premise + method + result in one clause. Final line cadence mirrors static hum; closure image unmarred by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense: “Respecting privacy, Elias did not open it, but a delicate locket had slipped free” performs three jobs in one line. One paraphrase loop appears—“silent contributor” is repeated three times in close proximity—triggering a −0.3 artifact penalty. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding obscures causality. Final line breathes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm: varied sentence openings, no template cadence. Figurative language dense but patterned (light/roots/chimes) and paid off in final chord. Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds pressure or sensory precision. Occasional elevated diction (“luminescent ache”) justified by lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and causal work. Only micro-loop: “time became clay… she sculpted the thread” compresses two metaphors into one beat, but coherence holds. Rhythm breathes with sentence variety; no filler or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density—almost every sentence layers image + emotion + forward motion. Zero loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. The single allowed cliché (“weight of understanding”) is buried in a climactic rush and does not touch the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “dust motes hung suspended…into swirling gold” reprises without loop. Mixed metaphors avoided; “taffy” stretch of minutes is brief, apt. No filter-verb stacks or synonym churn. Information density high—single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and mechanical data. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo, climaxing in the short declarative “She was finally, beautifully, seen.”

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. Figurative language sparse and accurate (“emerald velvet,” “whispered secret”). Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines bookend arc cleanly. Micro-movements serve pressure; no puppet-joint narration.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; clauses layer like glazes without paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors are avoided; rain-veins remain vascular, never stray to circuitry. One scaffold risk—“wryly earnest” repeated four times—verges on template but serves as motif-tag. Closure sentence “dreamed of rain trails leading not away, but home” is clean, resonant, unburdened.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; figurative language appears only at pressure peaks and pays off (“doorway woven from absence”). Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. One mixed metaphor—“river of consciousness” beside “tapestry of communal resilience”—but it occurs in exposition, not the closure beat, so clarity survives. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the scene’s crescendo and fade.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “water-bloated ledgers with critical pages torn away” packs three jobs in five words. No synonym churn, loops, or scaffold. Metaphors organic—“sound hung…like a fulfilled promise”—and internally consistent. One mixed metaphor risk: “emotional geography” versus “contours of what was lost” is salvaged by immediate embodiment. Final line propels: “promise of the next interval” snaps cadence forward. Artifact-free in closure third; eligible for 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; long breath mirrors fog drift, short clauses spike at punch-thunk. Information density high—each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work. No paraphrase loops; only one near-repeat (“trembling certainty” echoes “violent tremor”) but it frames contradiction, not redundancy. Metaphors stay coherent under physics of light-through-hole.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences vary from wind-tugged lyric to clipped scientific note; no loops or scaffold. “Ink-dark sea,” “pearlescent sheen” operate as precise sensory shorthand, not stacked purple. Opening and closing lines book-end with migrating whales, giving circular muscle. Zero grammar issues; punctuation clean.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths swell and contract with magnetic tide. Figurative density is high but patterned, taught early—“silent aurora,” “luminous silken threads”—so lavishness feels earned rather than purple. Two minor loops: “ten thousand years of solitude” and “burning quest” repeat concept without new inflection. Mixed metaphors avoided; spatial logic consistent. No scaffolding or synonym churn; information density strong.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (“She uncapped the pot; the scent… cut through the antiseptic sterility” advances action, atmosphere, metaphor). No loops or scaffold; figurative language sparse and precise. Strong verbs—“ink bloomed,” “dawn bled”—avoid purple. Copy clean.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between long inhalation (“dawn bled rose-gold across the mountaintop peaks”) and charcoal-stop fragments (“Texture: peace”). No paraphrase loops; each descriptive line adds either sensory grain or causal cue. Metaphors stay physically coherent—hum as heartbeat, gild as fire—without purple swell. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“every leaf whispered a story”) that recharges prior motifs. Zero typos or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety is tidal—long rolling clauses break into fragment crests. Metaphors stay coherent: “steel cliffs,” “bruised dawn,” each image tethered to port physics. Zero paraphrase loops; every line adds pattern or sensory grain. One near-purple moment—“sorrow too vast for words”—is forgiven because it is immediately undercut by the tactile sketch.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, and propulsive; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor. Figurative language is spare and purposeful—“note of gratitude hung in the twilight.” Sentence rhythm modulates naturally, accelerating under pressure. A single near-filter verb (“felt the irony settle”) is too minor to cap the band.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: sensory triads propel rather than stall. Occasional stacked modifiers (“breathtaking, chaotic mosaic”) flirt with purple but serve stakes. No loops, clean pronouns, strong verbs. Final paragraph softens impact with three abstract nouns in one line; a concrete after-image would sharpen cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no loops or scaffold; high density (“sealed the sand grain back into its pouch, tucking it securely over his heart”). One mixed metaphor cluster (“impossible gold fractured the horizon”) is permissible at climax. Technical photochemical description is accurate, concise, and propulsive. Final third is clean; 9+ gate opens.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; stacked metaphors are disciplined—only one per high-pressure beat. Information density high: "moonstone-infused resin, warmed...pliable as honey" does double sensorial and plot work. Zero paraphrase loops, no scaffolding. A single near-purple phrase ("perpetual pearl-gray haze") survives but does not touch closure, permitting high band.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Every sentence carries double duty: “condensation on the glass, a language written in droplets and frost-feathers” (58) fuses sensory detail with conceptual map. No loops or scaffold; clauses tighten under pressure. Figurative control: ice dust, rust, peat smoke form coherent palette without purple drift. Final line earns cadence release after controlled build.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or rhythm. Figurative language is sparse, never muddled. High information density—“translucent figures shimmered…before fading like gentle breath”—compresses entire resurrection into one line. No artifacts in final third; closure image pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear is musical: “jagged teeth of Serpent’s Reef,” “bruised horizon,” “copperlight repose”—alliteration serves lighthouse hum. Information density high; single sentences layer time, legacy, and texture. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold clause—“the impossibility the prison sustained”—is efficient, not redundant. Opening and closing lines bookend with identical cadence tightened by meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and world rule. Occasional modifier stacks (“profound hush of winter-cracked fields”) flirt with purple but stay in ghost register. No paraphrase loops; beat-level propulsion clean. One mixed metaphor—“lovingly venomous caress infused with chill of grave yet nurturing spark”—survives because it encodes core paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm, carry dense sensory information, and avoid loops; occasional stacked epithets (“hauntingly optimistic resolve”) flirt with purple but pattern is taught early and never muddies the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat. Figurative layering (“roots cradling bones like tender guardians”) is purposeful and paid off when roots become reunion metaphor at close. One minor loop: “interrupted journeys” is repeated in variant phrasings three times—trim one to sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety and information density are high; figurative language is selective, pattern-taught (“digital ghosts / tangible thread”). No synonym loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor cluster—“living tapestry of futuristic nostalgia”—but it lands early, not at closure, and is coherent within POV. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths echo embroidery glide vs. candle flicker urgency. High density: “falsified charts designed to steer the royal fleet into the Serpent’s Maw” packs world, stakes, danger into one clause. Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Only hairline slip: “embers” twice for leaves—minor repetition, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information density is high—single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and symbolic work (“mud accepting his boots without judgment”). Metaphors stay coherent: cathedral rain → memory channel → healing lens. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new pressure or texture. A single clause drifts toward poetic overlap (“weight vanished, replaced by quiet understanding”), but the cadence supports the exhale beat and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “The jagged black line was not a weapon; it was the shadow of the operating room door” advances knowledge, re-casts symbol, and releases tension in one beat. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is single-use and precise. Filter verbs appear only when motivated by interpretive distance (“she saw it instantly”). Final paragraph avoids syntactic monotony, letting clause length mimic exhalation. One mixed-metor risk—“watercolor haze of indigo and pearl”—reads as POV-appropriate synesthesia and does not blur closure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, metaphor, motion—without scaffold: “the moisture-laden fog acted precisely as exposed film” collapses world-rule, stakes, and tactic into one clause. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Figurative density peaks at the bloom but is justified by the taught pattern. Final paragraph trims to cadenced fade, leaving a clean ember of rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, sound, or interior shift. Figurative layering is patterned and paid off: the nickel as “acoustic prism” refracts both light and meaning at closure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves into image that recharges “Listen with curiosity.” Only one near-simultaneity (“as the light pulsed, the nickel warmed”) risks micro-timing blur, but the causal order remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    High-density lines (“root systems and pollinator paths to create temporary blind spots”) do triple duty—world, stake, tactic. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (pollinator paths ≠ mixed vehicle). One minor scaffold: “converging chaos” is repeated as a refrain—acceptable because pattern is taught early and pays off in final cathedral image. No artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but never purple; each figurative layer (tide-memory, nacre-mirror, saltwater-essence) advances the transformation arc rather than decorating it. No mixed metaphors—every vehicle extends the shell/sea constellation. Only minor scaffold: the phrase “shyly unstoppable” is repeated twice in close succession; the second instance could be cut without loss, a hairline slip that keeps this just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is dense and propulsive: each sentence layers image, motion, stakes (“sun’s first beam… only force potent enough”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors stay internally coherent (foxglove regret threads bioluminescent poison into nostalgia). One mixed image—“echo filtered through fracture”—is justified by physical acoustics. Final paragraph avoids sentimental diffuser; cadence slows to match fading song without syntactic collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “silver particles… swirled like captured starlight” performs scene work while staying vivid. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either decoding step or relational thaw. Metaphors stay coherent—ink as starlight, dust as musical notes—without mixed-vehicle crashes. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for archive hush, staccato for pre-dawn urgency. Minor scaffold in “glowed, and a distant symbol… shimmered” could lose “and” for tighter propulsion, but artifact does not touch closure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges the promise motif. Overall clean, musical, and urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative layering sometimes overruns immediacy (“mechanical sonnet of protection and provision”) and risks muddling physical logic. Adjacent paraphrase occurs once (“memory and motion breathed as one” after “community could finally breathe with it”). Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene, sentence lengths vary, props stay tracked, and no scaffolding dilutes the climax. A tighter final beat devoid of ornamental summation would lift density further.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. One scaffold phrase—“a desperate attempt to preserve the echo of lost songs”—is redundant but does not touch the final third. Strong verbs (“balanced,” “shattering,” “yielding”) carry motion. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or insight. No synonym churn or mixed metaphors; figurative language is patterned (fractured hush, featherly resolve) and paid off. Occasional elevated lyricism stays within Elara’s trained gaze, never purple.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (image + motion). Sparse figurative language avoids purple overload; only two consecutive metaphors appear, pattern-taught via “shadowseam.” No loops, scaffold, or filter stacks. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” conceptually heavy—does not occur in peak beat. High density maintained without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Varied sentence rhythm, strong verbs, zero paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated phrases (“violent kiss with earth”) are motivated by lyric register and do not obscure causality. Information density high; no figurative muddle in peak beats; opening and final lines serve as anchors and release.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: single sentences fuse tidal math, celestial angle, and emotional stakes. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensory or causal data. Metaphors (“emotional horizons”) are few, clean, and consistent with coastal optics. Rhythm modulates—rolling cadence for tide surge, clipped fragments for the flash moment—without template repetition. Minor filter verbs (“he felt”) are sparse and voice-motivated. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the bishop motif, satisfying read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythmic control heightens without clog: varying sentence length mimics surf-draw; no template cadence detected. Figurative vehicles (volcanic glass, dew-mirror) are sparse, coherent, and paid off. Information-dense lines (“luminous map of courage”) compress backstory without scaffold. Minor near-repeat of “grace” twice could shave 0.1, but closure line justifies echo.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—description, metaphor, and emotional register in one breath. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is patterned (rings = stanzas) and paid off. Filter verbs are voice-motivated. Minor elevation in “noctilucent reckonings” is earned by repetition and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify; no template cadence. Information density high—single sentences perform sensory, metaphorical, and causal work (“porcelain’s cracks…map of survival”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Figurative language peaks at closure but remains coherent: “fractures gleaming like starlight” fuses box, sky, and scars in one image. Copy-clean; no typos or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense but patterned; figurative layering is deliberate and paid off. No loops or scaffold; each sentence adds texture or advances ritual beat. One mixed metaphor (“silent seeds” and “light-vessel” in adjacent clauses) barely nicks clarity. Read-aloud cadence is tidal and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clean: no paraphrase loops, no synonym churn, mixed metaphors rare. Information density high—single sentences fuse action, sensory detail, and emotional charge (“Tears welled; this was the walls’ dream—a memory of warmth preserved against encroaching silence”). Rhythm modulates naturally from short clauses under pressure to longer lyrical cadences at rest. A single line—“each breath a commitment to memory”—skirts poetic template, but its placement mid-paragraph rather than at closure keeps it from artifact status.</answer>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
    <comment>The climate-softened stone/ivy premise is fresh, turning familiar post-apocalyptic ruins into a sensate archive that breathes. The conceit that walls dream, and that a cartographer maps those dreams, is specific enough to resist swap-test with another story. Risk is taken and paid off: the negative strip literalizes color inside a gray-green world without becoming a gimmick, recharging the entire color palette at climax. The synthesis of eco-gothic texture with archival tenderness feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “each step a prayer on stone older than the war” performs scene work while remaining lyrical. No paraphrase loops or template cadences; sentence lengths modulate with emotional crest. Metaphors are coherent (obsidian, dark flowers) and do not invade high-pressure beats. Only one near-purple line—“beauty existed in the trying”—slightly softens climax.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: each sentence layers image, memory, and moral calculus without scaffold. Metaphors stay physical—“cartography of loss,” “liquid-silver song”—and never collide. One paraphrase loop (“manufactured drought was his masterpiece of cold logic—a necessary evil he’d justified…”) is the only slack; it dulls nothing at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence texture varies: long braid-like clauses for knot-work, staccato fragments at sparks-release. No synonym loops; “threads,” “strands,” “filaments” each carry distinct tactile load. One mixed metaphor risk—“time-threads coiled like serpents of captured starlight”—but physical logic holds because starlight is earlier established as tangible filament. Information density high; each sentence advances either choreography or memory politics.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong rhythm and metaphoric control, but occasional purple lift (“meteor hush,” “cosmic”) and two paraphrase loops (“uncommon serenity” echoed) keep it from 8.5. Otherwise clean: no scaffolding, verbs stay strong, paragraph cuts are taut.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence music varies; scaffolding is minimal. Figurative load is high but patterned (weave/knot/signal) and pays off. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops. Only micro-stutter: “transiently rooted” reused twice within four lines near midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“golden light kindled within the reconfigured braids” is literal within crystalline optics. No filter-verb stacks; action verbs (“loosened,” “weaving,” “clicked”) propel. Opening and closing lines frame stakes and echo: aurora first watches, finally paints her path.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty—description advances motive and atmosphere simultaneously; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective, never dense in high-pressure beats; mixed-metaphor violations are absent. Rhythm breathes with the storm: short fragments at thunderclap, longer riverine flows during transcendence. The read-aloud ear test passes with natural variation and strong verb predominance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; imagery is selective, not overwrought. Occasional loftiness (“mathematical prayer to the cosmos”) edges toward abstraction, but never loops or stalls momentum. No scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with the scene—short clauses at fracture, longer cadences at merge. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is restrained and patterned (glass/light/breath), avoiding purple drift. Paragraph cuts are decisive; removing any would thin the harmonic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentence for memory cascade, staccato fragments for regolith crunch. Figurative language is selective—one sustained tapestry metaphor taught early and paid off; no mixed stacks. Information density high: one sentence often does setting, interiority, and motion. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; pronoun references clean.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: “torn pages, smudged sketches, deliberate voids” triples as imagery, stakes, and method. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent—vine as question answered. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from hush to dawn cadence. One mixed metaphor (“symphony of ancient forests”) barely audible.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid mechanical stems. A few soft loops—“memory altered” echoed three times in 80 words—dull propulsion slightly but do not touch closure. Figurative layering is controlled, not stacked. Strong information density: carnival shards double as emotional state. Would trim two adjectives (“mournful fog,” “sea-green eyes”) for diamond clarity, but line craft solid overall.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances image, motion, or knowledge. Figurative control disciplined: only two metaphors in the climax, both tied to POV (liquid memory, watercolor blur). Opening and closing lines are propulsive, framing and recharging the braid motif. Clean grammar, varied sentence lengths, strong verbs—publish-ready line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and world data without scaffolding. Metaphors are sonic-acoustic, maintaining coherent vehicle (“weaponized storm,” “hammered repose”). No mixed vehicles or synonym loops; only one paraphrase pair (“gently luminous” re-used) but it functions as motif glue. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalating pressure and final release. Meets 9+ threshold technically, but one nominalization hiccup—“acoustic equilibrium”—keeps it just below hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero scaffold loops; each sentence either advances star-tracking mechanics or tightens emotional cost. Metaphors stay physically coherent—light is “cool silver” vs “warm gold,” never mixed. Opening and closing lines bookend with sonic echo: “humming silence” becomes “humming silence” now reconfigured. The single “thistle-blown” repetition is intentional motif, not artifact. Rhythm accelerates into the three heart-beat clause, then releases, supporting the climactic pulse without drawing attention to its own virtuosity.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative vehicles stay coherent: fog as marble, shadow as black river, hush as breath—no mixed metaphors. Density is high—“ozone scent, granite chill, thunder’s fading growl” triples sensory duty in one phrase. No scaffolding; opening line anchors voice and stakes, final line resolves by resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long inhalations of description to short flare of revelation. Figurative layering is high but patterned—fire, bloom, seed—taught early and paid off. No loops or scaffold. One mixed vehicle (“liquid memory”) barely grazes clarity. Otherwise clean, dense, read-aloud strong.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, emotion, or causality. Density high: one sentence can layer starlight fracture, crab step, and rebellion against confinement. Metaphors stay within marine logic—no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm mimics tidal surge/retreat. Only minor slip: “warmly observant empathy swelled” edges label-ward, but immediately remedied by concrete image of resilience mirrored in pool.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: single sentences deliver sensory, emotional, and world data. Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence. One paraphrase loop—“silence with texture, weight…intangibly tangible”—is purposeful motif reinforcement, not scaffold. Minor nominalization “reconfiguration” tolerated in closure line where cadence demands.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Density high: one sentence often delivers setting, metaphor, and causal cue (“crystalline formations had stilled…plummeting noise levels she monitored”). No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; rhythm breathes with Leo’s relaxing heartbeat. One paraphrase loop detected (“vaulting hush” twice in three sentences) prevents 9.0. Otherwise scaffolding-free, propelling toward crystalline closure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty—description folded into action (“She drew the ruby flake, its sharp edge honed by time and purpose”). No scaffold loops; only one metaphor stack in the waterfall paragraph, but it is pattern-taught early and justifies itself. Minor register elevation (“profound stillness”) does not propagate into closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from hush to shared cadence. Figurative language is selective—charcoal lungs, starlit vent—never crowding the breath beat. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. One mixed metaphor risk: “ash whispered with every step” (ash does not whisper) but the personification is brief and thematic, not closure-critical.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose propels: each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative control tight—“captured nebula” fits POV’s wonder. One scaffold risk: “pressure” noun repeats 5× in 60 words mid-scene, but rhythm justifies thematic insistence. Zero mixed metaphors; grammar clean.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but breathable—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Figurative language is patterned early (sound architecture) and paid off at closure, avoiding purple overload. One microscopic loop: “eloquently silent” appears twice within seven lines; trims easily. Otherwise zero scaffold, zero mixed metaphors, strong read-aloud rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythmic variance mirrors breath of choreography; long sentence for path curvature, single clause for clasp click. Figurative layer dense yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. High information density: one sentence can anchor setting, object, memory. One paraphrase loop “quiet quiet” knocked.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; sentences pull double duty (action + atmosphere). One paraphrase loop detected—“quiet” appears three times in closing paragraph—minor scaffold. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clusters. Read-aloud ear test passes; final line lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long reflective coils to clipped imperative as danger nears; no two adjacent sentences open identically. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor load-bearing: “tapestry of stars” frames scale, “ghost” names the uncontainable data. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every clause advances image, stakes, or tactic. A single mixed vehicle—“truth...scattered like seeds across the continent”—survives because the agricultural seed dovetails with the lagoon’s organic diffusion, not enough to blemish closure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the performance: long sentences swell, then abrupt stops mimic rests. No paraphrase loops; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—light, dew, breath—so coherence holds. One tiny scaffold: “quietly vivid” appears three times; still, it functions as a refrain rather than filler, so the artifact does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear: cadence rises/falls with leaf spirals; sentence length varies. No loops, no synonym churn. Information-dense lines (“moonstone cabochon dust speck” packs four nouns yet scans). One micro-clip: “micro library carved from softened bark” could trim “softened” without loss. Metaphors internally coherent (leaf = clasped hand, veined like parchment). Closure image untouched by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “oil and patience” compresses vocation and weariness in three words. No loops or scaffold; metaphor chains are sparse and coherent. Final line swaps “tick” for “rhythm” to recharge opening clock motif. One mixed image—“roar and quiet courage”—but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety is music: balanced caesuras mirror alchemical balance, then short bursts imitate sparking flame. No looped stems or synonym churn. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“liquid obsidian” for rain-pool is precise, not purple. Information density high: one line often fuses sensory, symbolic, and causal work.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is dense and propulsive—“pale gold light bled softly over obsidian cliffs” does triple sensory work. Figurative language is selective; no metaphor piles up to obscure causality. Rhythm modulates: caesuras in harp passages mimic echo delay, accelerating into the single-tooth pluck. Only hairline slip: slight synonym echo “luminous ache” reused three times, not quite loop territory.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary from crystalline short shocks to longer accumulative clauses, sustaining momentum. Figurative language is selective—mycelial compassion—and never stacks into purple. No paraphrase loops; each sensory hit adds new datum to the theorem. One negligible scaffold: “silent significance” could be cut, but it occupies a low-pressure line and doesn’t touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    No loops or scaffold; sentences multi-task (“Her fingers closed around the lighthouse lens fragment tucked in her pocket, its surface cool and strangely alive”). Figurative layer is selective, never density-clogged. Opening and closing lines bookend with propulsion. Pronoun, tense, spatial sequence clean.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no loops or scaffold, strong verbs (“splintered,” “coalescing,” “dissolving”) drive momentum; only micro-slip is “weightless burden” echo used twice but charged at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: cascading anaphora (“The rustling…”) mirrors rising tide, then abrupt fragments at rupture. Figurative language taught early (glass leaves as pages) and paid off when books orbit press. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay within glass/light/sound palette. Minor scaffold: “of intricate gears and silent purpose” could trim, but does not stall propulsion or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from stately cumulative clauses to urgent fragments; no template cadence. Figurative layering (“time’s reflection becomes a liar”) is patterned early and paid off when mirrors are covered. Information density high: one sentence often sets scene, reveals lore, and escalates stakes. Minor paraphrase loop—“burnished sorrow” appears twice—caps at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves stakes rather than ornament. One minor paraphrase loop on covenant introduction; no mixed metaphors or template cadence in peak beats. Sentence variety supports the mounting crescendo and release. Read-aloud rhythm is musical, mirroring the subject without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: scent/mineral cousin, needle frozen not northward, swallowing light and sound—each noun does double duty. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative muddle absent. One minor scaffold: “lagoon’s quiet wisdom” is abstractions piled on an already vivid image, but it doesn’t touch the closing sentence. Ear test passes: final line’s cadence clinches the piece without syntactic gimmick.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    High-density lines carry triple duty: “rain traced ancestral paths down mossy stone” simultaneously shows weather, setting age, and metaphor syllabus. No filler verbs; “scaffold,” “timewoven,” “reimagine” are prompt terms repurposed as live verbs, avoiding ornament. Rhythm varies: thunderous nominative pile-ups for storm, then clipped noun phrases for carving beats. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds tactile or temporal information. Metaphors stay physically coherent—no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences do multiple jobs: “wool shawl whispering against stone” locates body, temperature, and hush in one stroke. Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor extends the light/pigment lattice. One paraphrase loop (“quietly driven” twice in four lines) and a near-mixed metaphor (“umbral tenderness washed over”) keep it sub-9. Otherwise, rhythm breathes with the dawn, and no scaffolding obscures the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentences twin celestial library with civil-rights archive, or merge cipher, heart-thrum, and historical stakes. Metaphors (“pool of liquid night”) remain internally consistent; no mixed vehicles. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Minor cadence repetition (“He could not… he could…”) is voice-motivated, pattern-paid by climax. Copy-clean; no typos or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: one sentence = scent of pine resin + lantern frames + rice-paper beat. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“tattered crimson lanterns… forgotten tears”). No loops; occasional adjective pairs (“dust and memory”) read deliberate rather than padded.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image double-loads atmosphere and thematic cargo. Minor risk of metaphor surplus—“velvet disquiet,” “ghost of the horn’s last breath”—but pattern holds, never tripping causality. Zero loops, clean grammar, strong verbs (“cradled,” “unfurled”). Final line earns its lift: “the archive of tomorrow had already begun to grow” compresses future orientation into one germinal clause.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often slots seed, myth, and motion. Rhythm modulates from frost-crack consonants to liquid sibilants as ice melts. Figurative layer is thick but each metaphor serves closure (starlight lens → vortex). Only minor loop: “frozen” repeats four times in one paragraph; does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere; no filler, loops, or scaffold. Figurative choices (“ice crystals tapping like distant chimes”) serve pressure without crowding. Varied sentence rhythm mirrors mounting calm then final release. Copy-clean; mended rope motif tracked without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense; most sentences dual-load atmosphere with interior motion. Occasional metaphor stacks (“liquid gold,” “primal elegance”) risk purple, but pattern is taught early and held. No loops or scaffold detected. A single paraphrase loop (“stillness was not neglect—it was a necessary breath…”) slightly dulls momentum mid-climax.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm variably paces the meditation; sentences carry double duty (image + emotional tilt). A few near-adjacent “dust” references flirt with loop, yet figurative logic stays coherent and never obscures the final click. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is clean: strong verbs, no template cadence, figurative language kept purposeful. One mixed metaphor (“breathing tapestry” alongside “pollen on the wind”) momentarily blurs the vehicle. High information density; only micro-slip prevents 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Figurative density is high but patterned early (“woven dawns,” “liquid obsidian”) so it reads as taught texture, not purple overload. No synonym loops or scaffold; each metaphor advances either atmosphere or theme. One mixed vehicle: “burnished hush” is tactile-auditory, but the burnish recurs in feather and dusk, forming coherent motif. Closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often charts wire path, sensory feedback, and lunar rhythm. Occasional modifier stacks (“copper-veined patterns glowed softly”) flirt with excess but stop before clutter. No loops, paraphrase, or template cadence; each paragraph advances either connection progress or bodily decline. Final line “Life continued, brazenly calm, deeply connected” earns its abstract note by the prior 399 words of concrete circuitry.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence clusters. Information density high: one line often performs atmosphere, character, and causality (“The fly amber warmed against her skin, humming in sympathy with the tower’s latent energy”). No mixed metaphors or loops. Passive voice used only when agency shifts require it. Final line resolves by image, not explanation. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm modulates from long hortatory sentences to the staccato bird translations, propelling the accumulative arc. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (“ivy over stone”). One mixed vehicle (“ribbon of weathered wood defiantly cradling”) is minor. No artifacts touch the closure beat; density remains high without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold, high density—each sentence advances stake or texture. Metaphors are spare and precise: “the vow of retirement a heavy stone,” “wind carried no dust today, only the faint, sweet ghost of autumn.” Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line crystallizes direction without exposition. Minor hyphenated coinage (“wild-hush”) is consistent and pattern-taught. Proofreading flawless; no typos or tense wobble.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
    <comment>Post-apocalyptic reunion quest is familiar, yet the optical riddle that requires a loved object as filter feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The phonograph cylinder repurposed as data dead-drop, the leaf as Rosetta stone—both are specific, non-swappable inventions. Risk is taken: quiet lyric pacing in a wasteland usually demands gunfire; here the tension is held by light and shadow, and it pays off. Slight deduction for the “one last maple” echoing every post-war pastoral cliché, but the execution rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify without algorithmic patterns. Figurative language is selective—only two extended metaphors, both anchored to physics of the setting. Information density is high: each sentence advances action, perception, or atmosphere. One minor scaffold: “echoed silence” is repeated three times; although purposeful for motif, it edges toward loop and keeps the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from crystalline noun clusters to breath-dash fragments, mirroring altitude strain. No synonym loops; “swap,” “replace,” “exchange” are functionally distinct moves. Metaphors (sleeping sentinels, bruised violet) remain single-layer and physically coherent. One scaffold spotted—“the spire groaned, but the oppressive hum softened”—yet the contrast serves pressure, not padding; not penalized.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm mirrors ritual footfall; sentence variety high, no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“dust motes like scattered stars” appears once, no clutter. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. One mixed risk: “benevolently ruthless” is abstract, but the next clause dramatizes it, so clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density—each sentence layers object, history, and emotional charge without scaffold. Figurative language is selective: only two metaphors in the climax, both clean (“sharp as shattered glass,” “cleaning rain”). One mixed echo—“hidden thunder” used twice—stays just under penalty threshold because it reweights at closure. Minor paraphrase risk in “decade of dust” could be sharper, but rhythm propels.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies without algorithmic pattern; sentence openings shift. High density—“silver thread salvaged from a frozen seamstress’s basket” does object + backstory + world rule in one stroke. No mixed metaphors; celestial engravings and chess knots cohere. One paraphrase loop spotted (“frozen… suspended… arrested”) but it serves the stasis motif and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences multi-task: “the canyon caught the line, echoing…” propels sound, stakes, theme. Metaphors precise—bone towers as petrified prayers—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each echo iteration reweights meaning. Final paragraph varies paragraph length to cadence ritual beginning. No scaffold, no synonym churn; opening line anchors voice and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is patterned (kintsugi metaphors) and paid off. Strong verbs (“sheared,” “hissed,” “quilted”) carry density. No register drift; technical terms (chronometers, resin) serve POV. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with crisis then serenity.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective: “cerulean sentinel,” “bruised purple dawn”—three metaphors in 350 words, not overwrought. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor adjective clustering (“cool salt-tinged air”) does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “Soldering a filament to the lotus carving, the scent of rosin summoned Kael” fuses action, sensory trigger, and memory in one sweep. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse and precise. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. One hairline slip—“raw solace” is repeated as label twice—but never in the closure beat, so 9+ remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence lengths vary, no template cadence. Information density high—one sentence can layer storm damage, metaphor, and emotional analogue. Figurative control: “rational truffle forager” is fresh, not strained; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each paragraph advances knowledge, tool state, or emotional charge. Opening and final lines frame voice and stake cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; sentences advance triple duty (image, interior, stakes). Rhythm breathes with descent/ascent staircase motion. Metaphors organic: “tapestry of shared humanity” grows from literal cloth of logbook. No filter-verb stacks; props tracked cleanly. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “beam swept on” as promise and burden.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with concrete nouns or strong verbs, avoiding template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“constellations across damp walls”). One scaffold loop: “the creek’s roar escalated; cold water seeped…” restates threat in adjacent lines—minor, outside closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, no scaffold loops. Metaphors are coherent—starlight as blood, embers as heartbeat—never mixed. One paraphrase loop: “quiet erosion, a hollowing of spirit” could compress, but it occurs early and doesn’t touch closure. Information density high; single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and symbolic work.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    Information-dense lines carry double duty—e.g.,“pigments ground from meteoric iron for courage” fuses world, motive, and metaphor. Figurative layering is high but patterned early and paid off at closure. One paraphrase loop—“density of presence” repeated without new pressure—dings 0.2. Otherwise clean propulsion, zero scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences twin image with insight without paraphrase loops. One mixed metaphor cluster (“minutes bled into decades” beside “memory felt as immediate as cold”) slightly blurs temporal logic. No scaffold, no template cadence; closure line is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentences perform atmosphere, characterization, and causal advance. No loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are disciplined—liquid time, brass breath—and pay off in closure. One clause of overwriting: “symphony of scents” is near-stock, but immediately offset by loss.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; no synonym loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“crystallized like frost”—never clogs the high-pressure beat. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Only a hairline slip: “the saturated hush had broken” is slightly abstract, but it follows the embodied exhalation, so momentum survives.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence layers motive, sensory cue, and metaphor (“dust motes…restless spirits”) without scaffold. Mixed metaphors avoided—axe/tree/root cluster is coherent. No paraphrase loops; “reconnection…apology…imperfect miracle” recur only to accumulate meaning. Final line “flawed, human, and perfect enough” risks moral summary but is earned by prior embodied cost and reads as crystallized stance, not overtell.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—stage, metaphor, pressure. Occasional cadence repetition ("walking out… journeying inward") is pattern-taught and pays off, so no loop penalty; closure image is crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught by the ritual, and never clutters the climactic “plink.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. High information density—each line advances image or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is selective and patterned (“cathedral of release,” “permeable barriers of shared humanity”) without cluttering causality. Zero loops, no mixed metaphors, clean grammar. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences cradle reflection, then fracture into short beats for the laser climax, propelling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lapidary, almost every sentence doing double duty (image + emotion). Occasional soft scaffold: “the traverse was not a destination, but a practice” abstracts what we already see. No mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates from long inhalations to staccato platform sounds. Closure image is crisp, unpolluted by filler.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is scaffold-free: no paraphrase loops, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports breath—long, humid clauses for tunnel atmosphere; short, plucked phrases for ring-break. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image that recharges “loop” motif. High density: one sentence often does three jobs (atmosphere, backstory, micro-action).

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences lengthen during ritual, shorten at wind-gust climax. No loops or scaffold; “gently thorough” used once, justified by character trait. One mixed metaphor (“waterfall of pale blossoms”) but cleared by closure beat clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes between long sentence and staccato fragment; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density high—each sentence advances image or motive. One mixed metaphor (“time pooled like spilled ink beneath the frozen clock tower”) barely grazes clarity. Clean proofing, strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density—each sentence layers sense, stakes, metaphor—yet rhythm breathes. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Mixed metaphors avoided; “ping” on quartz as high C is precise. Minor scaffold: “quiet blaze” repeated thrice could be pared once, but never muddles closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening structure; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat, each paying off (“loom where regret was woven”). No mixed metaphors or register drift. Information density high: “Ink flowed then, dark and decisive” simultaneously advances plot, stakes, and metaphor. Only minor paraphrase risk in “strange comfort” repetition, but the phrase accrues thematic mass, so waived.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    High density: single sentences layer grief, ritual, and tide motion with no filler. Metaphors (moon as vigil, silence as canvas) stay coherent within harbor physics. No template cadence loops; sentence openings varied. One clause—“luminous harbor breathed beneath a pearl-bright moon”—alliteration serves breath motif, not ornament. Copy-clean; no syntax errors. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory detail, backstory cue, and forward motion. Zero loops or mixed metaphors; rhythm accelerates through the corridor sequence and breathes at the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies from measured opening cadence to percussive verb-driven clauses during drumming, then subsides. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or beat. Figurative language is dense but purposeful—metaphors of loom, bridge, seed form coherent through-line. One mixed vehicle (“bridge of light spanning separation and trauma”) slightly blurs physical logic, keeping score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no paraphrase loops or filler. Figurative language is spare—“violent ribbons,” “thread of sound”—and always sensory, not ornamental. Only minor scaffold: “He waited, trusting…” could compress further, but momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary from 5-word imperative fragments to 35-word accumulative coils; no template cadence. Figurative density peaks at “luminous vine” yet pays off when the vine blossoms into Orion frame—controlled, not decorative. Zero paraphrase loops; each shutter verb advances pattern. Line-level propulsion matches light’s forward motion; final line “pocketed the dental mirror” lands with percussive closure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence lengths vary and paragraph breaks mirror breath-pauses of dive/ascent. Metaphors are mostly clean, though “language of fluid motion learned long before she ever stepped on a ship” condenses backstory into a compressed lyrical leap that may stall some readers. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; density is high—each sentence advances image, memory, or choice. A trace of template cadence in the tripled “of loss and resilient hope / of shame… of fear…” but it serves incantatory effect and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence splits wood, advances grief, or anchors setting. Rhythm modulates—long oratory curls give way to short prayer clauses. Figurative language stays coherent (wood curls = memories). One tiny loop: “remade hush” appears three times within fifty words mid-story; doesn’t obscure closure but prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm is supple, with sentence length and paragraph breaks breathing with the hum. Figurative load is high but patterned—cloud, stone, water—so density penalty is waived. Only loop artifacts: “the method of dissolving boundaries” triple repeat, and “humming quartz colonnade” appears four times with identical epithet. No mixed metaphors; all vehicles obey physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: asyndeton under pressure (“lamb’s ear for solace, rosemary for remembrance”), caesura at climax. Metaphors precise—“glass glittered like frozen tears”—never stacked. Information density high; one sentence often does three jobs (setting, sensory filter, symbolic payload). Only minor scaffold: “stepped through the warped iron gate” could trim “warped” without loss, but no loops or mixed vehicles obscure closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Few loops; high density—“liquid amber,” “fertile silence”—each metaphor advances texture rather than decorates; no mixed vehicles clutter the climax, allowing the final “music box melody lingered in the golden shadows” to land clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: one line folds memory, tool, and action (“cold tools felt like old friends welcoming her home”) without scaffold. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles mechanical (locket beacon, constellation map) stay consistent. Zero filter-verb clusters or synonym loops. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long breathless ascent sentence to staccato workshop return.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary from liquid long takes to staccato micro-beats: “Steam rose. He nodded.” Figurative control disciplined—rain as lens, map as nervous system—no mixed metaphors. Information density high: one line can layer sensory cue, inherited memory, and symbolic measure. Minor scaffold: “rain-beaded skylight” repeated; does not obscure closure but prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or atmosphere. Density is high: “sweat dampened the saffron threads of her veil as she navigated the emotional currents” performs three jobs—physical cost, color reprise, metaphorical current. Metaphors stay coherent: twilight bleeding violet, river carving stone, tear paths clean through dust. Rhythm climbs with purification intensity, then exhales in the final short sentence of sealed doors—no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, yet readable aloud without strain; sentence variety strong. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrase (“celestial light softened”) fits elevated setting. Information multitasks: “dream-vines cascading…each leaf a whispered memory” sets scene, theme, and stakes in one stroke. Closure image pristine; no artifact touches final line.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate yet varied; sentence length contracts in the shedding beats to propel momentum. Figurative language is selective—silver mist, cold stone, nebula birth—each image pays off in closure loop. No mixed metaphors, no template cadence runs. Minor hedge “quietly vivid” appears twice but serves as deliberate motif, not scaffold, and is thereby exempt from artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong information density—each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are mixed once (“meteor hush… physical presence… weight of waiting stars”) but do not tangle causality. Scaffolding nearly absent; only faint paraphrase loop on “displaced miracle” phrase. Closure line is clean; meets high-band bar.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences carry double duty—information + atmosphere—without scaffold or synonym churn. Figurative language is selective (“tear stains blooming like tiny maps”) and never clutters high-pressure beats. Opening and closing lines frame voice and re-charge motif flawlessly. Zero loops, zero mixed metaphors; read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with action: long sentences for meteor arcs, clipped fragments at catharsis. Figurative language is dense but purposeful—no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“warmth spread through her; the trapped creativity uncoiled softly”) costs 0.2. Otherwise high information density: each sentence advances memory, ritual, or release. No scaffolding, no template cadence, no artifact in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses—long sentences swell, short sparks punctuate. No loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative muddle absent; vehicles (light, breath, water) stay consistent. Minor scaffold: “step by step” and “spark by spark” pairings verge on formula but serve lullaby cadence, forgiven at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; sentences layer metaphor without paraphrase loops. Mixed-metaphor risk (“blooming clockwork flower”) is minor and fits surreal frame. One scaffold stem repeats—“the hum of insight was…”—but does not stall closure. Filter verbs minimal; rhythm rises to chime at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings rotate between prepositional, participial, and concrete subject. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—mist as whispered secrets, ticket as constellation—without mixed logic. One minor purple phrase (“silver thread on dark water”) but it caps the epiphany, so momentum survives.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong propulsion: noun-verb pairs (“bolt’s the anchor,” “wall slid inward”) avoid modifiers. Metaphor disciplined—“shard of frozen sky” introduces palette and recurs. No loops, paraphrase, or scaffold detected. One clause of simultaneous action (“tears traced…freezing instantly”) is allowable under sub-zero logic; does not cloud causality.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lines are dense but never congested: “constellations beyond the vanishing dome stilled for one perfect heartbeat” does image triple-duty (cosmic scale, finality, tribute). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; each sentence advances either material dissolution or thematic reweighting. The single metaphor mix—“time pooled like still water” beside “obsidian halls humming”—is justified by the taught pattern of timelessness as liquid and architecture as vibration. Proofing is clean; no typographic or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose density is high—each sentence advances image or stakes without scaffold. Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One mixed metaphor cluster (“deep-water current” + “tapestry” + “symphony”) appears mid-scene but does not touch the closure beat. No loops or filter-verb stacks; the tapping verbs drive motion.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; concrete nouns anchor metaphor (“needle of hope”). Occasional modifier stacks (“profound, aching lull”) flirt with purple but serve accumulative mood. No loops, no mixed metaphors, clean tense. Two near-successive “hum” sentences could fuse for density, yet the repetition is pattern-taught and pays off in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose carries high information density: “steam rose in ghostly plumes…renewal’s damp promise” layers sensory, symbolic, and political stakes in one stroke. No scaffold, loops, or adjective stacks. Metaphors stay coherent (volcanic memory, resin sigh). Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the unsealing, then exhales with the valley silence—line-level craft mirrors story pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    High-density sentences carry double duty (action + metaphor) without scaffold loops; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“liquid starlight” → “liquid dawn”). No mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor paraphrase overlap between “luminescent ache” uses, but the reprise is purposeful and does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propel without scaffold; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught (“patient sculptor,” “whispered magic”) yet never clutters the high-pressure ink-reading beat; one near-loop (“serene anger… serene acceptance”) survives but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Varied sentence rhythm mirrors stealth and surge; no scaffold or synonym loops; figurative layer (“cathedral of frozen memory”) is sparse, taught early, and paid off in cradle/tomb reversal—no clutter during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence music is purposeful: anaphora (“she whispered… she pressed… she turned”) threads mantra-like continuity without机械 template. Metaphors are few, precise, and physically coherent—“teardrop of hope,” “tranquil blaze.” Information density high: one sentence often carries sensory data, emotional tilt, and symbolic freight. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; no mixed metaphors in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory data, emotional state, and world rule. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors in peak beat. Occasional adjective stacks (“rust-pitted relic,” “wild, untamed authority”) flirt with purple but serve cadence. Zero paraphrase loops; pronouns and spatial tracking clean.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Information-dense: each sentence either advances evidence or charges atmosphere (“sea of cloud”). Mixed metaphors avoided; “orbits of regret” recurs with accruing meaning rather than decoration. No loops or scaffold; final line cadence slows to match dawn light, satisfying closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: each image does double duty (amber = time capacitor + guilt capacitor). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language thins during the high-stakes hum so the sonic act itself stands clear. Sentence variety supports the tidal build-reverse-release of the cry. Minor cadence echo in “folded time smoothed…” is intentional and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences pull double duty—description advances emotional mapping: “concentric circles mapped the cyclical nature of grief she sensed.” No filler loops; each clause adds pattern or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent within sand/light/acoustic field. A single soft cliché—“like iron filings to a gentle magnet”—is offset by original cluster of “whispering gallery tile flake,” keeping overall freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentences (“to cradle empathy…”) give way to staccato fragments at the renaming beat. Figurative language is selective—one sky metaphor, one bone-ash simile—avoiding density overload. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or emotional charge. Minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” and “resonant reconfiguration” are evaluator meta-terms, not story diction, but they appear only in this rubric, not on the page itself.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose density is high yet propulsive; every sentence layers sensory and emotional information without paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors are controlled—"silver thread," "amber strand," "bronze smoke" stay within the textile/cord motif. One overwritten flourish ("light through shattered crystal") appears early but does not recur at climax, so artifact stays minor. Closing image of coin with lovers now clasped is crystalline and uncluttered, earning its quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with exposure countdown; sentences vary from short shocks to long spirals. Information density high—single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Three near-adjacent “fractally precise” create template cadence; mixed metaphor “liquid starlight” slightly muddies viscosity. Otherwise clean: no loops, no filter-verb stacks, pronouns unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are sparse and coherent (amber core = heartbeat). Sentence variety supports tide-like rise and fall. One near-purple phrase—“radiant amber core”—survives because it names the map’s literal pigment frequency.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: each sentence layers image, memory, and emotional calculus. Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence; figuratives stay coherent (no mixed vehicles). Zero loops, filter-verb clusters, or scaffold. One minor adverbial softener ("quietly inspired" repeated) keeps it from 9.3.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors avoided—mist as confession, zephyr as carrier, earth as absorber—each vehicle stays coherent. High density: “brass worn smooth, an olive branch and Veritas” does triple duty (texture, symbol, backstory). Final line “Spring was not a destination, but a direction” supplies rhythmic closure without editorial flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence lengths, high density (needle-as-mending symbol performs double duty). A few adjective clusters (“crystalline plink,” “soot-choked valley”) flirt with overwriting but never obscure causality or final image. Zero loops, clean grammar, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences perform double labor: “ochre waves” collapses color and motion; “scorched wasteland stretched” locates and exhausts in three words. No filter-verb stacks; perception is direct. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“ochre waves,” “bruised twilight”) and reprised in final “indigo” sky—patterned, not cluttered. One near-loop: “stubborn lavender clung / clung to life” could compress, but it occurs outside the closure beat and does not obscure causality. Read-aloud rhythm is clean; paragraph cuts coincide with sensorial shifts, never stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm modulates like breathing; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are mixed but purposively—moonlight as oar-path, gauge tooth as sacrament—coherent under Accumulative lens. One scaffolding clause (“with unwavering motion”) could trim. Otherwise high density, zero artifacts in closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “Seventy-two hours had passed since the reincarnation memory surfaced” compresses backstory and clocks urgency. Metaphors are precise—“present dissolved like salt in water”—and never mixed. One minor paraphrase loop: “isolation into independence” is repeated almost verbatim; a −0.2 nudge applies. Otherwise rhythm varies, no scaffolding obscures causality, and the final paragraph lands with clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry double duty—action + sensory tag—without scaffolding; no filter-verb clusters. Metaphors are few, apt, internally coherent (“tiny architecture of instinct”). Paragraph breaks follow beats: find → build → invite → witness → complete. Zero paraphrase loops; opening and closing “prismatic quiet” functions as deliberate reprise, not redundancy. Clean grammar, precise tense, no artifacts even at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    No loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are coherent: scar→static, drought→conversation bloom. Information density high: “frequency of empathy woven from celestial mathematics” does triple duty (method, stakes, theme). Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during hijack, then exhales at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, taught, and paid off: “carved lines writhed like serpents” prefigures spatial mutiny; “reverberation…unfolded like liquid light” is the single allowed flourish at climax. Paragraph lengths breathe with pace—short at panic, elongate at wonder. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes promise. No grammar slips.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—“lanced the moss away—a precise, piercing motion” does double duty (tool + metaphor) without purple overflow. No synonym loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated. Final line burns off mist with monosyllabic punch that recharges earlier “pearl and ash” palette.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; high-pressure beats favor short declaratives—“Evacuate immediately”—while reflective passages stretch without cadence template. No scaffold or synonym loops; “spongey dread” is reused once with added charge. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“wall of black water”—and do not stack into purple density. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the nail’s transformed value without abstract gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is rhythmic, compressed, high-density; every sentence advances image or stake. Minor loop: “scaffold wrap flutters” exact phrase recurs three times; still, it never clutters the climax. Metaphors stay coherent (glass cracks = luminous pathways). Clean grammar, strong verbs, zero scaffolding beyond that repeated collocation.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; no scaffold loops or synonym churn detected. Metaphors stay coherent: dusk “bled indigo,” money “whispered,” nothing strains physics. High information density—each sentence layers past theft onto present mentoring. Occasional elevated phrasing (“crystalline clarity”) flirts with register drift but occurs outside peak-pressure beat, so clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with her ebb and surge of fatigue-to-clarity; no filler stacks. Figurative control precise: “suspended breath” marries stellar and human lungs. One adjacent paraphrase loop (“shared burden… shared light”) mild enough to spare 9-band. Otherwise high density, zero scaffolding, clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: “vine of emerald and silver thorn” does double descriptor work without overwriting. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for ritual build, short bursts for thaw. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensor or causal bit. Metaphors stay consistent (armor, blade, thorn, mirror) and culminate in the “luminous petals like gentle snow” closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds tactile or emotional news. Figurative density stays disciplined—one metaphor per beat, vehicles coherent (“roots became earth’s veins”). Strong verbs (“snaked,” “traced,” “flooded”) propel without adverb clutter. Final line lands clean; no scaffold. Micro-fragments under stress serve pulse, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “confidently uncertain” carries contradiction in two words; no scaffold. Metaphors are controlled—patience of cliffs, shroud of shame—never stacked. Clause variety supports the emotional inhale/exhale. Occasional adjectival uplift (“immense quiet”) stays within POV lexicon and does not infect the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm: varied sentence lengths, no template cadence. High density—each sentence advances image or cognition. Zero loops, zero scaffold. Metaphors organic (“graceful unspooling”) and internally coherent. Opening line anchors stakes; final line recharges seed motif. Minor elevated register (“conceptual repricing”) justified by scholar-POV and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is steady, sentences vary in length and opening, and density is high (“emptiness holds space for stars”). One paraphrase loop (“gleaming under the gentle gold / wintersun that promised warmth without heat”) is minor; no mixed metaphors intrude. No artifact obscures closure; prose control is strong though not virtuosic enough for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—long clauses for hush, stub sentences for the decisive release. Figurative language is disciplined: no mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. One scaffold-like echo (“latent radiance” repeated) is pattern-taught and recharged at closure, hence forgiven. Final tear-on-shell moment is dramatized, not summarized, giving the image propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences multitask (“dust motes swirled... carrying scent”). No loops, no mixed metaphor; “razor-sharp world edges” recurs with purpose. Final line cadence echoes opening “razor-sharp” now softened to “current of peace,” rewarding pattern. Minor scaffolding: “with a slow, deliberate breath—a daringly methodical inhale” compresses twice; trimming one clause would nudge higher.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, no scaffold; every sentence either transcribes, anticipates, or embodies the reversed-time rule. Figurative language stays physical (“words… flickering into existence after a breath-held pause”). Opening and closing lines book-end the reversal motif. No register drift; diction remains within POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or filler; every sentence advances image, pressure, or interior shift. Figurative language is sparse under the climax—one perfect metaphorical note—so nothing dulls the crack of ice. Read-aloud cadence mirrors melting tension: long vowels early, abrupt fricatives at shatter, soft nasals in aftermath. Grammar immaculate; no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “sky congealed into ancient stone” packs state-change and age into six words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative chain (aurora → mandala → beacon) is coherent, never mixed. A single filter-verb cluster is absent; immediacy holds through tactile verbs—placed, channeled, traced—so the closure beat stays unmarred.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings avoid mechanical templates. Information density high—one sentence often does setting, metaphor, and interior move (“the scallop a physical manifestation of her forgiveness…”). Two adjacent near-paraphrases (“silent devotion” / “quiet triumph”) slip in but do not touch closure. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors. Clean grammar and punctuation.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences vary in length and avoid template cadence. Figurative language is selective—mirror shard as “tiny star,” cloak as “departing shadow”—and never floods a single beat. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; “wind composes a new song” is the only slightly stock phrase but is earned by prior chime pattern. Grammar and tense are clean; opening and closing lines are sharply anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is variegated, rhythmic, loop-free; figurative language is disciplined—one metaphor per beat, each re-paid by closure. Opening anchors voice & stakes instantly; final line recharges sycamore hush as “well-worn cloak,” returning to skin-level breath. No scaffold, no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Clause length modulates with physiological drop into trance, accelerating propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold or loops; each sentence adds layer or cadence. Figurative control: bone towers “vast as cathedrals” is single comparison, not chain. No mixed metaphors; physical logic holds (arrowhead warms, dust settles). High information density: one sentence can adverbially compress time (“Through centuries…”) while advancing atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or filter stacks; figurative language is sparse, pattern-deliberate (“brilliant dimness,” “sterile fireworks”) and never muddies causality. Information density is high—every sentence advances atmosphere, memory, or mythos—yet rhythm breathes, mirroring ascent/descent.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty—action + metaphoric charge—without crowding beats: “waterlogged books slumped on shelves like sleeping sentinels” moves gait and atmosphere. No filter-verb stacks; props tracked cleanly (key pocketed, produced, abandoned). Mixed-metaphor risk in “meteor hush” pays off as intentional oxymoron that fuses sky lanterns and silence. A single paraphrase loop (“light” thrice in two lines during lantern climax) keeps it from 9; otherwise density is lean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Information density high: single sentences do triple duty—worldbuild, embody emotion, advance beat. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence; figurative language is patterned (amber, resin, pearl) and pays off. Register stays within POV lexicon; no mixed metaphors. Final line is propulsive yet crystalline: “She was aligned.” One hairline slip: “quiet enthusiasm now a steady hum” is minor abstraction, but embedded in actionable pulse, so −0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with prepositional, participial, and simple clauses in deliberate sequence. No looped stems or mixed metaphors; figurative load reserved for transformation beats, never clutters causality. High information density—each line advances image or interior shift. Minor purple tinge in “impossible clarity” but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is rhythmically varied, information-dense, and loop-free; figurative language (“liquid gemstones,” “bronze wound”) is selective and paid off. No scaffold or synonym churn; each sentence advances drip, bell, or sea. Precise numbers (14.7 °C, 4.1 s) read as character data, not clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “bone by bone due to an unrelenting drought” collapses decades into five words. Metaphors are selective and paid off—mirror, hush, compass. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Final paragraph risks slight cadence overkill (“one rescued artifact, one remembered moment at a time”), but rhythm supports closure, not obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences multi-task: “She ignited the brazier, and the flame, channeled through the woven copper, transformed from a chaotic blaze into a gentle, undulating river of light” advances action, sets image, and enacts theme. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Figurative language is disciplined—each metaphor (flame as river, starlings as scripture) is internally coherent and pays off in the final glow. Zero artifacts in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative layering (“soundless echo,” “sacred shroud”) remains coherent under accumulative mode; no mixed metaphors. High density: frost/obsidian/buckle triad performs triple duty (atmosphere, tool, symbol). Final line cadence earns quiet release without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty—advance image and reweight concept—no scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective and pattern-coherent (storm/silence, void/canvas) without purple overload. One mixed-metaphor risk (“archives dissolved and reformed”) is minor and does not touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates at ignition, then exhales into the final wind-whisper cadence; paragraph lengths vary purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often layers external action, metaphor, and interior tilt (“seed…promise of rare beauty and infamous decay”). Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence; paragraph cuts are lean. One mixed metaphor cluster (“liquid metaphor for creativity’s persistent, unseen current”) slightly dilutes peak beat but does not obscure closure. Clean grammar and punctuation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between the engine’s drone and fragile lullaby fragments; no two sentence openings repeat. Information density high: “He poured his mournfully eager spirit into the gale, willing it to carry remembrance, love, and unspoken apologies” advances character, method, and stake simultaneously. Zero loops, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. Only a single adverb-laden tag (“hesitant step”) keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentences for mist, staccato under light-beam. Information density high—“silver spiral ignited with cold blue-white fire” does visual + tactile + symbolic work. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “boundaries of light” repeated 3× in last third; does not dull closure. Line-level artifacts absent from final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long breathless clauses of failure lists to crisp imperative “Show me your true shape,” then softens into liquid moonlight. No scaffold loops; each image advances state change. Minor purple patch—“paradoxical frozen bloom” repeated twice—deducts 0.2, but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the wind-gusts and receiver hiss. Sentence variety is deliberate: long anaphoric accumulations mirror assumption-shedding; final paragraph fragments into quiet. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Information density high—each sentence advances stance or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, with high information density; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One paraphrase loop (“patterns swirled, flowing like liquid mercury”) is minor. No mixed metaphors or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Clean copy, clear sequence, strong momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong noun/verb choices (“sunlight fractured,” “thread jerked taut”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new texture. Figurative density high but pattern-taught (optical illusion grammar) and paid off. One mixed metaphor edge—“river of flowing time, thick with the scent of old paper”—slight coherence wobble. No scaffold sentences. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns. Final line lands quietly without overwriting. Top-band blocked only by that single metaphor muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is tactile and propulsive; sentences open variably, most do double duty. Occasional formula triads (“memory, iron, and hope”) and near-repetitive “horizons unfolded” phrase count as micro-loops but do not stall closure. Mixed metaphors absent; clarity preserved. One filter stack (“Kael felt...”) is minor; no artifacts intrude on the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary from violet-tinged lyric to clipped “She did not mention the hearing aid,” propelling without scaffold; only one soft loop (“fragile” twice in four lines) keeps it from 9+. Metaphors stay coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: noun + strong verb dominate; adjectives rationed. Figurative layer (“cathedral of forgotten science”) is earned and brief, never clogging cryo-beat. Zero paraphrase loops, no filter-stack. Rhythm breathes—paragraph lengths visually mirror descent/ascent. Copy clean; only typo-scan “illuminant” used consistently. Closure sentence unmarred. Meets 9− threshold with microscopic waiver on the single cadence echo noted in Q6.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; information density high—each line layers sensory, emotional, symbolic work. One paraphrase loop (“snow…blank page”) and one mixed metaphor (“ink bloomed like a neural map”) are minor, do not blur closure. Strong verbs dominate; nominalizations absent. Opening and closing lines frame voice and re-charge motif. Zero scaffold or template cadence in final third; 9-band remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line density is high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and world data without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent (bone towers as cathedrals, diamond as captured constellation) and physically consistent. No paraphrase loops; each bird-pattern description introduces new acoustic information. A single mixed trope—“humming with latent potential” (sound/touch overlap)—is forgiven because the pattern quickly resolves into literal sonic action. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence rises and falls with the flock’s choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong rhythmic variation; high noun-to-adverb ratio. Some metaphor clusters border on excess (“cathedral of roots and resilience”) yet serve atmospheric density. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Closing line’s “frost began … to thaw” is an elegant reverb on earlier frostbitten motif.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm rises and falls with scene temperature; short percussive clauses during uprooting yield to longer, blooming sentences as petals open. Information density is high—each sentence carries sensory, causal, and emotional payload. Only minor scaffold: “resonantly soft” is repeated three times, a touch self-echoing but pattern-taught and paid off in final note. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors; grammar clean, tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense without clutter; no loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Figurative layer is selective—bottle storm, liquid sapphire—and each vehicle returns to charge closure. Opening and closing lines bookend the arc cleanly. A single over-adorned phrase (“sacred and sorrowful”) barely nicks perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary from short crystalline images to longer cadenced clauses without algorithmic drumbeat. No scaffold loops; each line advances texture or knowledge. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“library of folds” recurs with new charge. Register stays within POV lexicon: “tessellations,” “asymptotic” are tools she would know.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; clauses layer sensory particulars without paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors avoided—“luminous absence” recurs as trained motif. Strong verbs (“ignite,” “thread,” “trace”) carry weight. One minor scaffold: “the archipelago’s whispers carried unusual clarity” echoes prior “whispering archipelago,” but cadence is intentional, not slack.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor template cadence in “He…” subject openings across three adjacent sentences mid-story (−0.4). Otherwise strong ear: assonance, internal rhyme, controlled caesuras. Mixed metaphor risk (“prison for tender idea”) is rescued by conceptual payoff. No loops or synonym churn in final third; closure image remains crisp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—“iron ribs twisted like a beached leviathan’s skeleton” grounds scale and decay. One negligible loop: “remember to be curious. Remember to look” is deliberate anaphora, not artifact. Closure line is uncluttered, letting the mended constellations resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythmic control—from languid twilight clauses to the staccato “Return.”—mirrors emotional arc. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. One mixed metaphor risk: “blade sheathed in velvet” beside “geometry of tea” survives because both fit Kael’s persona. Clean mechanics; fogged facets and ink-drop propulsion maintain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet read-aloud clean; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“liquid silver” returns as “luminous in-between”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Information often dual-purposes: “emerald moss softened ancient stone” grounds footing and signals time’s layering. One minor filter verb cluster (“she felt… she felt…”) keeps it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with task: long sentences for knot-work, clipped fragments at climax. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors (frost-silence, river-light) stay coherent and physically grounded. Only minor density spike—“silent rivers of sapphire and silver”—but it serves atmospheric calibration, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary from 5-word breath-units to 40-word layered clauses that echo rain-patter rhythm; no template cadence detected. Metaphors (shadow as dark arrow, stains as sentences) stay consistent with cartographic/astronomic logic—no mixed vehicles. Information is dense: one sentence locates the vault, dates the map, and signals the tear’s thematic role. Only one paraphrase loop: “silence…whispered…quiet” cluster mid-paragraph; isolated, does not dull closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long silt-laden sentences to clipped surgical patience during untangling; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, deliberate—glycerin seas, frozen stars—never muddies physics. Information density high: single sentences deliver dive depth, POV bias, and object placement simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; most sentences perform double duty (image + motion). Occasional stacked modifiers (“tinkersong wonder—a fusion of artisan’s pride and awe…”) slow the beat without muddling causality. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors mar the closing lines. Strong read-aloud rhythm supports the incantatory intent.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences layer job, sensory cue, and emotional tilt. Figurative control disciplined—glacier light as decoder is concrete, not purple. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Paragraph cuts tight; each advances knowledge or emotional charge. Read-aloud rhythm varies; opening and closing lines serve as frame hinges. Qualifies for 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence variety supports altitude and breath: fragments for turbulence, flowing clauses for starlit calm. Metaphors stay atmospheric, internally coherent—“polished jade” lenticular, “forgotten sigh” cirrus. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “geometric fidelity”) fits academic meteorologist but flirts with excess; one mixed moment near climax (“quietly explosive peace”) barely avoids muddle. No scaffold loops; each cloud entry advances archive and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level density is high—pigments “ground from stone and berry” does world + character work in five words. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay organic (wood, sky, coin). One minor scaffold: “heightened stillness” is repeated verbatim; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the demolition clock; no artifacts appear in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean: 730 words with high multi-tasking lines (“amber light bled… living tapestry”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Mixed-metaphor risk (“sea of clouds,” “tapestry of synchronized motion”) is kept coherent by persistent sky-weaving motif. One density spike—“brass fittings tarnished and silk balloons slack, a majestic relic embodying stranded luminance both literal and metaphorical”—is earned as establishing compression. Final line varies rhythm, closing on forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from frost-hush to gear-hum. Metaphors are sparse under the high-pressure cap twist, preventing muddle. One filter-verb cluster (“felt like a heartbeat”) is earned nostalgia, not clutter. No loops, no synonym churn; information density stays high without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean: no filter stacks, no synonym loops, varied sentence openings. Figurative language is selective—“silent explosions of white and pink” sharpens blossom burst without clutter. One mixed vehicle: “hope felt brambled” is abstract, but the metaphor is seeded early and reprised, so forgiven. Final paragraph contains no artifact; cadence slows to match benediction.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “brass gears measuring not hours but the universe’s fading coherence” does double duty (world-rule + stake). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent—spirals within spirals—never mixed. One filter-verb cluster (“She felt the patterns ride…”) is marginal and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density: each sentence adds sensorial, emotional, or causal data; minimal scaffolding. Metaphors stay internally coherent (void as fertile ground, moonlight as liquid shadow). Occasional elevated register (“luminous manuscripts”) reads intentional to celestial locale. No loops/paraphrase in peak beat; closure image sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors consistent—culinary, geological, aquatic—without muddle. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Strong verbs dominate; punctuation clean. Final line cadence crystallizes closure. Hairline slip: “liquid sky” cliché −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates with task: long liquid sentences for Arabic vowels, clipped Anglo-Saxon bursts for gear catches. No scaffold or synonym loops; each image does dual duty (rosewater cleanses and perfumes, beeswax seals and honors). Only hairline slip: “vigorous tender” repeated twice, not enough to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet aerial: “spectral light,” “fossils embedded,” “double helix of shared humanity.” No mixed metaphors; moonlight = bone = lens sustains one coherent vehicle. One paraphrase loop: “abandoned dream” appears three times within 60 words—minor −0.2. Otherwise, sentences propel, each layering new emotional stratum without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motion, or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “water droplets ascending like liquid stars.” No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. High information density with rhythmic variation; final line lands as cadenced release.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet audible: “time had softened its edges, but a complex cartography of stress cracks mapped its surface like a sorrowful score” does three jobs in one line. Figurative logic stays coherent—no mixed metaphors. One tiny loop: “silence was not an emptiness; it was thick…” restates the same negation. Otherwise zero scaffold, high information yield, clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is lean and propulsive: each sentence layers sensory, thematic, or causal work. Figurative language is selective (“sky bleeding twilight hues”) and internally coherent; no mixed metaphors. Filter verbs avoided; strong verbs (“pierced,” “rooted”) drive motion. One minor template run—“His…His…He…” in closing paragraph—detected but does not touch closure beat. Density, clarity, and rhythm hold under peak pressure; qualifies for high band.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is rhythm-varied and information-dense; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor scaffold: “the weight of love turned to stone” restates the preceding “calcified regret.” One metaphor mixed—“dense, aching tapestry”—but it does not tangle causality or dull the closure beat. Otherwise clean clause control, strong verbs, zero filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences multitask (action + sensory filter + emotional tilt). Occasional modifier stacks (“subterranean whispers—a shift in moisture, a faint metabolic sigh”) flirt with overwriting but stay purposeful under lyric accumulative mode. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Word-count brackets are extraneous but treated as non-textual artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences advance either navigation or revelation. Figurative language is selective—“stone tears,” “living map”—and avoids purple overload. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; spatial choreography tracks cleanly through the arch labyrinth. A single mixed metaphor (“covenant” after “heart”) is minor enough to leave the 9-band in reach.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances measurement, memory, or meaning. Metaphors are sparse, physics-loyal, and paid off (“wind singing the metal to failure” becomes literal fatigue data). Strong verbs dominate—“unslung,” “documenting,” “reconstructed.” Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges wind mapping. No register drift or mixed metaphors under closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density—each sentence advances layer or resonance. Figurative language is disciplined, pattern-taught, peaks at climax without clutter. No loops, filter stacks, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated noun pairing (“crystalline cerulean shard”) flirts with purple but serves auroral scale. Closure beat crystal-clear.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe with ritual pacing. Information dense: driftwood placement conveys apology, map, and humility in one motion. Mixed metaphors avoided; canyon as “steadfast companion” is earned. Minor scaffold: “avalanchingly quiet” repeated thrice with same adverbial form; still, the pattern teaches the hush motif. No loop obscures closure. Opening line anchors voice & stakes; final line resolves by ember image. Read-aloud flow strong.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Each sentence performs double duty: “shadows deepened into chasms between type cases” advances both emotion and spatial ground. No scaffold, no loops; metaphor vehicles (starlight, ink, halo) stay internally coherent. Read-aloud rhythm mirrors press cycle: build → clack → release. Only hairline slip: “lucid peace” edges near oxymoron cliché, but context reforges it as technical term—barely shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Varied sentence openings, strong verbs, zero paraphrase loops; information density high—“barren earth scarred by frost began to tremble” does three jobs in nine words. Two adjacent “luminous” tags in final third slightly dull the shine, but no artifact touches closure. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates perfectly with plant growth.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density; sentences advance character, image, and concept simultaneously (“Raising the prism, he caught the sun’s first beam… fracturing light across the frost-etched surface”). No paraphrase loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts tight. No artifact appears in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences are information-dense and do double labour (description + concept), e.g., “raveling silence…unraveling time’s tapestry.” Mixed-metaphor risk is high yet held together by loom logic. Filter verbs minimal; body-part attention (“palm warmed by bead”) keeps immediacy. A five-sentence run beginning “She wove…” beats a template cadence; this is pattern-taught repetition, not artifact, so penalty waived. Closure line “silence…resting, whole and deep” lands clean, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong density: single sentences handle atmosphere, motion, and metaphor simultaneously. No mixed metaphors; azure light stays consistent. Minor template cadence in three successive “his [verb]” lines inside the cavern (−0.2). No loops or scaffold in closure zone. Opening and final lines are image-anchored and propulsive. Overall read-aloud rhythm is controlled, elevating this above median.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence rhythm mimics cyclical surge—repetition of “shift” and “cycle” taught early and paid off when the pattern stills. No filter-verb stacks; every clause either advances spatial transition or interior recalibration. Metaphors are self-consistent: “forgotten prayers” for skeletal ships fits vacuum mysticism. Final line cadence slows to match earned silence, no drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is rhythmically alive: varied sentence openings, tactile verbs (“nestled,” “ignited”), no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—moonlight “fracturing into spectral rainbows” charges the lens for the later sea-glass glow. One mixed metaphor (“bottle the feeling… in this fragile architecture”) is allowed because the conceptual CR lands cleanly. Clean copy, zero artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective, never clogs high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    High-density lines carry triple duty (image, emotion, craft rule). One scaffold loop: “steady, foreign rhythm within her ribs” echoed twice in 50 words. No mixed metaphors; figurative language thins exactly when flash occurs, giving the image room. Minor ear-wobble keeps it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense but patterned: three long sentences launch consecutive paragraphs, creating a breath-caught litany that pays off in the short climactic sentence “the final fragment clicked.” No mixed metaphors; “liquid silver” and “sigh-like chime” stay coherent. Minor scaffold: “quantified sorrow” is repeated twice within forty words; a hairline slip that does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template runs. Figurative language is patterned—woven, thread, loom—taught by 25 % and avoids mixed metaphors. Information density high: one sentence often conveys sensory data, emotional state, and world rule. Zero paraphrase loops; final-line release punctuates without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphor vehicles (moonlight bleeding, library sighing) are sparse enough to avoid purple clutter. No loops or scaffold detected. One mixed metaphor—“weight dissolved into light”—is minor, does not touch closure beat, so only hairline deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose carries high density: crust/steam/seed triad performs triple duty every paragraph. Rhythm modulates from languid ivy sentences to staccato seed list without drumbeat. Mixed-metaphor vigilance clean—no vehicle collisions. One small scaffold: “quiet argument against despair written in seeds” is abstract summary adjacent to concrete action; trims 0.2. Otherwise ear-test reads aloud smoothly and closure line lands crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet luminous; metaphors (“mathematical elegy,” “midwifed meaning”) extend the midwife/scientist fusion without mixed-vehicle collisions.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm, accelerating during interventions, then lengthening into the indigo-gray payoff. Figurative language is selective: “splintered bones” of the pier, “coil of tension”—each image accrues rather than decorates. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every clause advances story or stakes. Proofing is clean; pronouns track cleanly during the crowd swirl. No mixed metaphors or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but breathable: figurative language appears in <40% of sentences and each image advances cause or texture. No synonym loops or paraphrase clusters; “taste” variants are distinct stimuli (lavender/rosemary/honey). Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one sweep; final line releases image instead of summary. Only minor filter verb (“she understood”) is justified as internal closure beat, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“phantom limb,” “alchemized hope”)—never clogs the high-pressure reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “toxic sky stained the glass domes ochre” anchors setting, tone, and metaphor. No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Figurative language is patterned early (gold, wilting) and paid off. One mixed metaphor—“permanent bruise”—survives because it is taught in the same sentence and does not recur under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence, echoing bell resonance; no loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “a pocket of primordial winter” conveys cold and time in one stroke. Opening and closing lines bracket the symphony without scaffold.

    Prose is lean, image-rich, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“sandstorm calm”) and paid off. Sentence variety supports the hush-to-release arc. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear varies cadence; sentence openings diversify from participial to subject-verb. Figurative density is high but patterned—“skeletal sentinels,” “silken thread”—and justified by lyric mode; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: “quiet triumph of intention” echoes “quiet vow” without new charge, a −0.2 artifact. Otherwise information-dense: one sentence often layers setting, tool, and emotional tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences carry dual duty (action + sensory filter). Three adjacent “gleaming silence” echoes flirt with loop but function as accumulative cadence; no mixed metaphors or scaffolding obscure beats, sustaining clarity through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is high: information-dense, little scaffold, metaphors stay physical (“syllables dissolving like salt”). Occasional poetic堆叠—“quiet brook singing a liquid lullaby”—teeters on excess but serves the spell-casting mode. No loops or filter stacks; final image is crisp, propulsive, and unpunctuated by clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative density peaks at “tragically radiant supernova” but pattern-taught by earlier light imagery, so forgiven. Strong verbs (“tucked,” “bled,” “carved”) propel momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm modulates to breathing cadence; no template runs or mixed metaphors. Information density high: “drip gathered like liquid starlight” does atmospheric and causal work simultaneously. One minor loop: “forgive the unfinished” is echoed three times; still, it reweights at closure so penalty minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence layers image + motion + emotional valence. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphors (“reed-blown melancholy,” “stone ribs”) remain consistent. Opening and closing lines act as tonal brackets. Micro-movements (“footsteps silent on ancient stone”) serve spatial anchoring, not clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances image or motive. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“glass dome slumped like a frozen tear”—never stacked. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm modulates with dive descent and resurfacing, culminating in the single-breath rainbow beat that clinches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long petrichor breaths to the short pulse of “pulsetwice.” One paraphrase loop (“hidden effort…hidden patterns”) is minor; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences carry double duty—action, image, radiation data—scaffolding minimal. Metaphors stay consistent (storm, stillpoint) and physics holds. Only loop: “comfortable lie” repeated twice within forty words near midpoint; trims easily. Otherwise propulsion clean, no filter-verb stacks; final line lands quietly without syntactic drag.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is textured and varied—“raw energy of the tempest and the ghosts of forgotten star charts” does dual world/character work. Occasional modifier stacks—“rain-slicked Oakhaven,” “cobalt glass portico”—slow the beat but never within the 23-second climax. No loops or scaffold; opening and closing images ring without echoing verbatim. Strong read-aloud rhythm; only a faint purple tinge keeps it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose balances lyrical density with forward pull; sentences multi-task—”He felt the melody weave with sparrows’ chirps” advances action while layering texture. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent (glass jars as captured sunsets) and support closure. One mixed image—“sky bled from indigo to pearl”—is familiar but does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences do dual duty: “the artifact flickered desperately, its serene glow dimmed” marries internal and external states without paraphrase. Rhythm breathes—long clauses during resonance, stark fragments at silence. One scaffold echo: “this was vibrational matching / this was sonic absolution” risks thesis restatement but functions as ritual anaphora. No mixed metaphors or register drift; minor loop penalty forgiven because repetition serves liturgical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: movement, atmosphere, and lunar math. Zero paraphrase loops; each image adds new angle or tension. Figurative language peaks at the moss emergence, justified by prior monochrome setup. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates toward sigil pulse, then exhales with the single crack.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty—action + atmosphere—without scaffold. Metaphors are sparse, precise: “metronome counting down the society’s lies.” No paraphrase loops; each photograph/measurement beat adds new information. Opening and closing lines bookend water/drought motif cleanly. A single register drift: “manufactured this preventable death” sounds policy-manual; −0.2. Otherwise propulsion is high and closure image uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lines multi-task: “dust motes drifted like silent prayers” sets atmosphere and Elias’s vocation in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, motive, or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught early (“vibrant hush”), and paid off when hush shatters into melody. Only hairline slip: “aptly deliberate” appears twice, a micro-echo that nicks variety.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: single sentences weld sensorium to action (“tightened… with a wink… already dissecting”). Metaphors machined to world-logic (“stubborn flea on a furious green beast”).

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breath-sentences and clipped haul-shorts, mirroring net pull. No loops or scaffold; “windborne solace” is repeated with purpose, not churn. Metaphors stay coherent—ice as memory vault, parasol tip as compass. One mixed image: “fold in patience” is abstract, but anchored immediately in net-haul physicality, so clarity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet breathable—each sentence layers sensory/figurative work; no loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold; occasional elevated phrasing (“liquid honey,” “indelible geometry”) flirts with excess but remains within Elara’s meditative register and never muddles closure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual respiration. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (“embers cooling in twilight,” “subterranean heartbeat”) and never clutters the high-pressure consecration beat.

The final line’s quiet resonance emerges from concrete image, not abstract assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening device; no template cadence. Figurative language is patterned—fog as camera, wood as spine—and pays off in the final mist-chair. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances pressure. One mixed moment—“tidal longing burned” is slightly stock, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythmic control is exemplary—sentence lengths swell and ebb with song cadence. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; “hymned the mundane” is repeated twice but pattern-taught and paid off. Metaphors stay physically coherent (clouds drift below window). Minor over-writing in “pulsing stillness” (twice) and “radiant haven” (twice) nicks −0.4; still, information density is high—each sentence layers grief, object, and motion. Closure beat is clean of figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: elongated sentences for observatory hush, clipped fragments for gear-shudder crisis.

One scaffold pair: “She forgave their terror; it was human” could compress, but it does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    High figurative density but patterned—glass-as-teardrop, mist-as-blessing, stars-as-calm—taught early and reprised at closure, so allowed. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; each image advances mood or stakes. One paraphrase loop (“light that required no fire” / “light could be offered without consumption”) costs –0.2. Otherwise momentum breathes with the task.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence variety and information density are high; each descriptive stroke also moves her feet or mood. A single mixed metaphor ("green veins of renewal") and two adjective pairs could trim, but no loops or scaffold stall momentum, and cadence mirrors her slowed pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; metaphor density is high but patterned (mist, spiral, web) and supports the accumulative design. Minor loop: “inside the whisper of closing pages” appears four times with diminishing returns, not quite earning its final recurrence. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding that obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Paragraph and sentence rhythm vary naturally; high density allows image-character-theme to share single lines without scaffolding.

The prose propels, breathing with the song cadence, achieving near-flawless line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong rhythmic variation and information-dense clauses; a few stacked epithets (“skeletal testament… violet twilight”) slightly congest the opening beat. No looped stems, metaphors coherent, propulsion clean through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rhythm breathes with diagnostic tempo: short beats for filing, longer lyrical rise at the harvest. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds either new mechanical knowledge or atmospheric charge. Metaphors are spare and mechanical—“ghost of correct function”—never stack into purple. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve by image, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses with weave build-up, sentences vary, no loops; figurative layer is dense but patterned early (“shingled hush,” “fractal…nautilus”) and pays off in the bell-closure, so density penalty is waived—only minor scaffold in “cool and familiar” whalebone line.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density—each sentence carves image and motive together; no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized time,” “conceptual repricing”) risks register drift but reads as Elara’s artisanal precision, forgiven under voice motivation; no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym churn. Figurative language is selective, never stacked in high-pressure beats. Information density is high: one sentence often performs atmosphere, character, and world rule. Only minor scaffold: “fractured stillness” is repeated but reweighted at closure, so the loop serves pattern rather than artifact.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise—cloud-top carousel of frozen emotion—is non-obvious yet fully committed to; world logic stays internally consistent. The disposable-camera-as-memory-gear transforms a mundane object into irreplaceable metaphysical tool. Erosion-as-art reframes a universal trope through specific lived detail (poet trading verses for ledgers). Risk-taking (mercury clouds, time-thin scavenger) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; closure feels inevitable in hindsight.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“liquid constellation” pays off the sextant motif. Information density is high: one sentence often advances action, reveals setting, and carries metaphor. Minor scaffold: “quiet hum of resolve” is faintly generic but does not touch the closure beat.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
    <comment>Using a tarnished sextant shard to calculate a drainage angle that turns a derelict spaceport into a planetarium is a fresh synthesis; the relic’s prior function literally guides the redesign. The “equation for hope” could feel gimmicky, but it is grounded in the character’s vocation and left as private notation, avoiding TED-talk trap. Risk is taken with the lyric final image and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work—e.g., “droplets fell with infinitesimal taps, creating a whispering chorus felt more than heard.” No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles (frozen memory, glacial hush) stay coherent. Read-aloud rhythm breathes at climax. “Excruciatingly gentle” repeated twice is deliberate pattern, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density—single sentences layer mood, back-story cue, and prop handling. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (“cathedral of deceit” paid off by “blueprint”); no mixed metaphors. One adjacent paraphrase loop (“quiet, burning motivation” vs “quiet, burning motivation”) is a hairline scar. Closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “twisted root of smoky glass, frozen in the moment of its violent creation” does triple descriptor duty. Rhythm modulates naturally between long atmospheric sentences and tight single-clause beats. Only minor filter-verb cluster (“she felt understanding settle”)—doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; figurative language purpose-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythmic variety and high density (“Autumn had bled the maples bare…”) propel the piece; occasional poetic stack (“skeletal branches etched against a bruised sky”) risks purple but stops short of muddling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty (action + image) with near-zero scaffold. Metaphors (clouds like memories) stay coherent and sparse, avoiding purple overload. Clause variety supports lull-then-focus pacing. Only micro-loop: “black sand” repeated three times in 30 words mid-story; not at closure, so −0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with discovery: short nominal discoveries (“She pocketed it”) alternate with longer accumulative clauses that mirror sidereal waiting. No scaffold—each image advances stake or texture; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay physically coherent (“silent comma in the bruised twilight sky”) and do not invade high-pressure beats. Opening and closing lines carry echo-weight without algorithmic symmetry. Proofing clean—no homophones, consistent tense, precise comma use for temporal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm ripples like the pings it describes—sentence length undulates, paragraph cuts land on image beats. Figurative threads (petals, gears, starlight tears) recur with purpose, no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" is repeated as a refrain; it accrues mantra force but edges toward template cadence, preventing full 9.0. Otherwise dense, clean, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm mirrors emotional arc—long, image-laden clauses in reflection shorten to staccato beats at discovery. Figurative language is disciplined: “dusk bled indigo,” “river of orange and black,” each vehicle sustained without muddle. Information density high: single sentence (“Clutched in her lap…”) delivers object history, color palette, and emotional freight. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases image that recharges every prior ribbon/poem/butterfly cluster. Zero typos or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences vary in length and texture, propelling ascent and descent; metaphor is restrained to volcanic grit, brass, and tide. No loops or mixed vehicles; the final “gull traced the pendulum’s arc” crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong sensory specificity; only minor scaffold (“threads, each a potential vessel for a whispered memory” restates prior). No mixed metaphors or filter stacks; figurative language disciplined to one image per beat.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty (description + causality), zero paraphrase loops; figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“crack spreading like hope’s lightning”) and paid off in closure. Final line resolves by image, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence music is purposeful: long metaphoric spirals accrue like orchestral phrases, then break into staccato fragments at interference crackle. Information density high—almost every clause does double duty (scenework + symbolism). One mixed-metaphor cluster (“thistled calm” / “orange heartbeat” / “swallowing mist”) skirts purple but pattern is taught early and recurs, so coherence survives. Zero paraphrase loops or filler verbs inside critical beats.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, character, or causality. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“melancholy snow” is earned because the particles are literally drifting. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges the gold-lacquer motif. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the rocking cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances knowledge or texture. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “cultural winter,” “seed-keeper”—vehicles stay consistent with Kael’s botanical/hydrology lexicon. High information density: one sentence layers chronometer function, longitude calculation, and civic metaphor. Opening and closing lines echo through “drip of filtered water” → “drip of water marked time,” creating cadence payoff without template monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “crimson leaves pressed against the leaded windows like stained glass” does atmospheric and temporal work in one stroke. Varied sentence length mirrors musical phrasing; no template cadence detected. One paraphrase loop—“traveled stillness” repeated thrice—minor, does not touch closure. Read-aloud ear clean; metaphor vehicles coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences do multiple jobs: “Moonlight pierced shattered panes, illuminating a jungle of dead vines strangling hopeful saplings” situates, describes, and foreshadows conflict. Metaphors stay agricultural and gustatory, avoiding mixed vehicles. One scaffold echo—“pruned despair and planted resilience” restates prior paragraph’s content; minor. Read-aloud rhythm rises to the starlight strike, then exhales with the single tear line. No artifact touches closure.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The memory-tasting chef who prunes past into future soil feels genuinely fresh; synaptic agriculture twists both magic-realist and culinary tropes. Risk is taken in quiet rebellion—no villain, no shouted stakes—yet coherence is maintained. The transformation of “tasting the past” into “planting it wisely” supplies an inevitable-yet-surprising reconfiguration. Could edge higher if a personal flaw had endangered the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates fluid long sentences for dusk with staccato beats for intrusion; no template cadence. Information density high: lacquer box sentence delivers history, texture, heirloom status in 21 words. Metaphors stay coherent—nectar, cathedral, ember share warmth/sacred register. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors; no filter-verb stacks. Final line lands on monosyllabic ember for sonic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is supple, with sentence variety and purposeful paragraphing; however, occasional modifier stacks (“quiet blaze of intentional love”) flirt with abstraction, and two near-paraphrase lines about the hush soften propulsion. No loops or mixed metaphors, but the crest beat could shed one adjectival layer for 9-band clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and stress; no template runs. Metaphors are stone/ocean congruent, never mixed. One paraphrase loop (“revelation cascaded…revelation followed”) costs −0.2, but it occurs early and does not touch closure. High density: each line advances knowledge or image. Proofing is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is lean, propulsive, lyric when emotion peaks yet avoids purple. No paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new texture or advances theorem-as-ritual. Mixed metaphors are absent; “pearlescent haze” and “rupture with a sound like shattering glass” coexist without physics clash. Closing cadence—dice click, next proof begun—gives a crisp exhale that recharges the motif perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—moon “drinks” light, saffron “quiet”—and never stacks in high-pressure beats. Information density high: one sentence often sets scene, reveals motive, and advances ritual. Minor loop: “quiet” appears three times; forgiven because final “saffron quiet” is recharged by nurse’s note.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling from misty observation to kinetic harvest (“People climbed moss-slick paths…”). No paraphrase loops; each line advances image or decision. Metaphors stay coherent—waterfall as veil, bread as vow—without mixed collisions. One near-overwrite: “healing incantation” skirts cliché, but the next clause grounds it in scent, averting penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; rhythm breathes with beats. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—light, coins, smoke—teaching early and paying off in dissolution image. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. One paraphrase loop (“lingering luminance… faint, persistent glow”) and two filter verbs (“seemed to writhe”) slightly dull immediacy, invoking −0.3. Artifacts do not touch closure; final line is clean. Density and propulsion remain high, warranting the 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors the escalating storm—short strikes for dubs, longer coils for cloud spirals; zero paraphrase loops. Metaphors (wind like water round stone) stay physically coherent. Only a hairline slip—“thread of intention woven into twilight” flirts with abstraction, but the next line grounds it in vibrating driftwood.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero synonym loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image, causality, or sonic density. Figurative vehicles are internally coherent—rust as text, crack as verb, gate as sentence—never mixed. Information density is extreme: “tidal charts etched into the turtles’ shells, ancestral star-songs, and the leviathans’ subsonic vibrations” does triple duty in one line. Read-aloud ear test passes: varied sentence openings, paragraph breath control, final line lands with percussive salt-crust crunch.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated phrasing (“emotionally rational to the end”) flirts with label-speak but occurs post-closure; no loops or mixed metaphors obscure causality; minor scaffold in repeated “parallel” phrasing keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful anaphora; no scaffold loops or filter stacks. Metaphors stay coherent (lake as glass, ink as seed). One paraphrase loop (“interlaced absence was no longer a wound; it was a tapestry”) costs −0.2. Otherwise information-dense, propulsive, clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. “Dappled resolve” recurs but accrues new semantic weight each time, avoiding template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and internally consistent—no mixed metaphors. High information density: one line can layer sensory cue, world rule, and emotional charge without crowding.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motion, or stakes. Figurative layer is spare but precise—crane “mid-flight,” basilica “woven from light and longing”—never clotted. Varied sentence openings and paragraph breaths create natural cadence. Copy-clean; no mixed metaphors, no simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. High density: one sentence often performs three jobs—“The geode, salvaged from the chapel rubble where Liam’s ring had glinted moments before impact, was her resonator” = backstory, emotional stakes, object function. Rhythm breathes with beats. No filter-verb stacks. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “silent ocean.” Proof-level clean.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm variegates: paratactic drone telemetry gives way to sensuous clause chains, then the staccato “He inserted… click.” No filter-verb stacks, no scaffold loops. Metaphors are spare—”scattered diamond dust”—and physically coherent. Information density high: one sentence can do setting, tool, and emotional tilt. A single tiny repeat of “brilliant dimness” is the only blemish preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally sleek, but recurrent “weight of unspoken words” and “sieved hush” refrains edge toward template cadence; the轻度 repetition dulls the final third without obscuring causality. Metaphors stay coherent (tiles/temperature = regret). High information density; no scaffold sentences. One mixed image: “tiles drank the fading light” is vivid yet anthropomorphic—minor, not closure-touching.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong verb choices—whipping, coiled, untether—propel without adverb clutter. One paraphrase loop: “mist coiled…mist-filtered moonlight” inside 40 words; minor, does not recur. Metaphors remain coherent (wind-whipped banner, pearl sliver). No filter-verb stacks; pronouns track cleanly through the silent exchange. Final line lands with crisp resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Salt-and-kelp diction stays specific: “splintered giant,” “guttering candle,” “dome of sky.” Metaphors are few, sharp, never stacked; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes with paddle strokes; no template cadence. One near-loop: “flickering faith…flickering faith” frames opening and close, but here it functions as deliberate reprise, not scaffold, so waived. High information density: single sentence often carries sensory cue + emotional valence + plot pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density, zero loops; figurative language disciplined to one vehicle per beat. Syntax breathes with emotional cadence, climaxing in clean closure image. No artifact near ending.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, no scaffold; each sentence layers image or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—antlers like frozen lightning, moss velvet-soft—without mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in 21 words; final line crystallizes the re-warmed moon without exposition. Information density is high: “saffron threads harvested from a dying star’s echo” does triple world-building work in eight words.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). Occasional purple flourish (“choking beauty” twice) risks poetic overload but stays tethered to POV. One paraphrase loop: “willingly perplexed” idea is restated three times in close succession, dulling edge slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but propulsive: “she did not push with muscle” compresses action and philosophy. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “stitch together the torn fragments of her psyche” stays inside the established sewing through-line. One minor loop: “memory by memory” restates “stitch by stitch.” Otherwise, syntax varies, strong verbs anchor, and no artifact touches the final seam-unravel line.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences are plush but information-dense; occasional modifier strings (“silent waltz choreographed across millennia”) verge on purple yet serve cadence. No loops, clean pronouns, strong verbs; one paraphrase echo (“whispering hush” / “vibrant hush”) is intentional motif-reprise, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Precision verbs (“gnomon clicked,” “stone panel slid”) carry propulsion; figurative layer is selective, never thick enough to occlude. Occasional adjacency echo (“luminous fort…luminous moss”) is the single paraphrase loop, minor. Rhythm breathes with paragraph breaks that mirror Kael’s pauses, tightening the blackout window.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences for aurora, staccato for boot clicks, then quiet final line. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds pressure or texture. Metaphors stay coherent—liquid mercury, borrowed dawn—without mixed vehicles. Only minor scaffold: “whispered by her mentor Kael with his dying breath” could lose “with his dying breath,” but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose achieves high density without purple overload: each sentence layers image, emotion, and concept (“censorship had not erased her voice but refined it, forced it to rarefy”). Mixed metaphors are avoided; lightning, timers, and constellations share circuitry/celestial logic. No scaffold loops; paragraph cuts are clean—remove any and the pattern collapses. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: spondaic stresses (“storm-kissed wonder”) accelerate, then settle into iambic closure (“quiet courage of beginning again”).

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; sentences carry double duty—sensory + conceptual. Occasional luxuriant stacks (“liquid gold upon flagstones smoothed by centuries”) flirt with purple but serve accumulative texture. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor nominalization drift (“reverence’s shore”) keeps it below 8-band purity.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—light, rust, seed—so it reads as intentional texture, not purple overload. Strong verbs (“clawed,” “fractured,” “surrenders”) replace modifiers. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve by concrete image. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong density—“afternoon light bled through vaulted glass” does triple duty. Occasional modifier stacks (“luminous cyclone, coalescing into Leo’s gentle smile”) slightly overwrought in closure beat; one mixed liquid/light metaphor keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and clause, sustaining tidal rhythm; no template runs. Figurative layer is dense—mist, tide, loom of ivy—but each vehicle belongs to Elias’s maritime/botanic lexicon, so coherence holds. No mixed metaphors in the closure paragraph where cerulean washes “jagged rocks.” A single paraphrase loop (“he sat… steady hands, heart lighter”) costs −0.2; otherwise line craft is near flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“pollen, silt, and wing dust woven into a silent map”) and avoids loops or synonym churn. Minor deduction for slight overuse of figurative language in mid-section (“fragile constellation,” “tender methodology,” “nature’s slow painting”)—three adjacent metaphors risk density without payoff. However, closure remains sharp: “fleeting rainbows” and “lightness of belonging” earn their lyricism. Sentence variety and paragraph pacing support emotional arc without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “molten silica,” “charred paper,” “crystalline veins” do triple duty—sensory, thematic, character-revealing. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “visceral echo of the attempt—the splintering door, the shouted threats…” borders on stacked modifiers, slightly dulling immediacy. No paraphrase loops, but one near-redundancy: “steadily adaptive resilience” and later “steadily adaptive grace” risk synonym churn. Final paragraph’s rhythm is masterful, though “beacon for anyone learning to find meaning in the spaces between” edges toward abstract uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, evocative, and purposeful—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or method. Figurative language is coherent (grief as “indigo swirls,” peace as “liquid gold”) and pattern-taught early. Minor overwriting in “monument to unspoken guilt” slightly edges toward label, but quickly redeemed by embodied action. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally. Final lines (“silence was not void but canvas”) achieve high information density without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line payoff: “bioluminescent fungi cast a soft blue glow on shelves crusted with coral” establishes setting, mood, and decay in one stroke. Figurative language is coherent (light as memory, silence as mausoleum) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “sorrowful fragments” and “profound and earned peace”—adjectives bordering on label-speak—but these don’t obscure causality or dull closure. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with tide-cycle pacing, and paragraph cuts always shift knowledge or charge. No loops, scaffold, or simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language (“woven thread by thread,” “heartbeat of remembrance”) is coherent and pattern-taught. Minor overwriting in “star-dusted skies” and “violet at the horizon” slightly dilutes momentum, but not enough to obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. The final lines achieve high information density without sacrificing clarity or propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush but precise, with high information density: “moss-veined railing,” “cerulean beam,” “liquid gold” all do double duty in atmosphere and theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with breath and revelation. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent lines (“the hollow ache of that dockside regret… the method required no incantation”) where near-paraphrase slightly dulls momentum, but no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors impair clarity. The final third remains artifact-free, and the closing line—“her breath a quiet prayer for all love waiting to be seen”—resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “leaves rustling with quiet consciousness” conveys atmosphere, character belief, and world logic. Figurative language is consistent (ivy-like absence, time as fabric) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in climax (“luminous threads peeled away, spiraling upward…”) borders on density overload but pays off in closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“Morning mist…”, “Elara moved…”, “Clutched in her palm…”). Final line (“stepped forward into the light”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information-per-line (“iron manacle was cold against her skin, a familiar anchor”). Minor overwriting in “staggering grace” (used twice) borders on motif repetition without deepening. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “resilience” appears three times in closing lines, slightly diluting impact. Final paragraph remains clear and propulsive despite this.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose achieves high information density: each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere without redundancy. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light “carved,” silence “woven,” absences as “negative molds”) and pays off in closure (“battered marvel of memory made manifest”). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“deep blue water’s groan of solitude, the bleached coral’s papery whisper”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure causality. Final lines vary rhythm effectively, syncing coil’s pulse to heartbeat without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with high information density (e.g., “ivy that shimmered like liquid jade under the amber sky” does setting, mood, and time). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “luminous disbelief washed over her” borders on label-speak, though quickly grounded in action. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final line (“the world hummed... meant for her”) resonates without sentimentality, though “honest beams” slightly strains metaphor coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density (e.g., “molten glass clinging like captured dawn” merges image, action, and metaphor). Rhythm varies purposefully: longer sentences for reflection, clipped phrases for tension. Minor overwriting in two adjacent lines (“Flaw. / Imperfection.”) edges toward scaffold, but no loops or artifacts dull the closure. Final image—light dancing through cracks—propels theme without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “feverish betrayal still scorching her veins,” “oxidation trails weeping down specific shelves” fuse image and emotion. Sentence rhythm varies effectively—staccato during crisis, flowing in resolution. Minor overwriting in “pearly half of a conch shell, emitting a faint, rhythmic whisper that vibrated in Elara’s bones” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops or scaffold. Final line’s “truth forged in shared courage” risks abstraction but is anchored by preceding concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting risks clarity: “ambered hush” and “marbled hush” verge on repetitive abstraction, and phrases like “fossilized within the calm” lean decorative. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines summarizing silence types without added pressure (e.g., barracks vs. hearth hush descriptions). No fatal artifacts, but slight inflation in figurative language prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density: “frost feathers on stone benches” conveys texture, temperature, and transience in four words. Sentence openings vary (“Unit Seven… Its optical sensors… This precise window…”), and paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “sub-audible resonance vibrated through its frame, unlocking sensory echoes” slightly muddles causality, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Final lines achieve lyrical propulsion without sacrificing clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“Rain had softened the world, leaving the crystal whispering forecourt gleaming…” establishes mood, setting, and motif). Figurative language is coherent—light, sound, and moisture interweave without muddle. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“ethereal luminescence,” “mosaic of shock”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict (“veins like ancient roots,” “meter blazing 98.7%”). Figurative language is coherent—marble fractures echo vine breaks; polish “fills fissures with light.” Minor overwriting in “milk-white marble webbed with hairline fractures” slightly slows momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“It knew her scars. It knew her name.”) delivers closure with rhythmic inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “sky bleeding from amber to deep violet,” “silence a palpable silence,” “icy warmth of a universe infinitely kinder.” Figurative language is coherent—time as “tapestry,” “lattice,” “breath”—and never muddled. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with action (long for buildup, short for climax). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final sentence crystallizes motif without redundancy: “mechanically warm hands” now hold cosmic warmth, closing the loop with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“water-born images pulse like a heartbeat,” “silence so profound it felt like the world holding its breath”—but avoids overwriting in peak beats. Sentence openings vary; rhythm mirrors musical phrasing. One minor flaw: “lately inspired” appears three times in close proximity, creating slight synonym churn. Otherwise, every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot, with high information density and zero paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or conflict (“fever-sharpened sight,” “ghost-scent of pine resin”). Figurative language is coherent—“swaying certainties,” “stone of guilt,” “aurora’s silent dance”—all rooted in mountain/weather motifs. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in peak beat (“cold, dense stone of remorse” borders on label-speak, though immediately redeemed by embodied tear). Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful (e.g., ending on whispered promise). Final line (“carried into the whispering wind”) recharges “margin” motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “valve wheel wrapped in blue glass beads” conveys mystery, craft, and deviation from official record in one image). Minor overwriting appears in “moth to flame” and “profound hush,” but figurative language is mostly purposeful. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. The final paragraph’s cadence (“walked toward the faint, grey promise of dawn”) resolves with earned lyricism, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“moss to stitch broken flagstones with emerald thread”), yet avoids overwriting through concrete verbs and varied syntax. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., “pearlescent glow,” “solidified night”) is pattern-taught and pays off in the swan’s functional magic. Final line (“future whispering its next verse”) resonates without redundancy, closing the cadence with earned lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-figured (“hands that spoke in gentle chords,” “hush of dreaming roots”), risking opacity in high-pressure beats. Yet rhythm varies effectively, and information density is high—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor scaffold: “ordinary magic” appears three times, verging on refrain but justified by thematic payoff. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves with earned lyricism, though “cautious exuberance” slightly drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“bronze quiet,” “dragon-fire”) and pays off in the closing image. No loops or scaffold—each description serves pressure (e.g., “edges blackened by flame” conveys loss without stating it). Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in mid-text, but rhythm remains varied and propulsion clear. Final line (“eternal”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“tide carried the old solitude away”) and varied rhythm. Information density is high—each sentence advances character, setting, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in “weathered and sure” (redundant) and “transposition was complete—the lonely key... shifting into a duet” (slightly abstract). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one register drift: “transposition” and “minor key” lean musical/metaphysical beyond Silas’s established lexicon, though context justifies it as metaphor for emotional change.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density (“chapel woven from solidified silence,” “pauses placed like stepping stones”). Figurative language is coherent—threads, tapestry, vines—all reinforcing the core metaphor without contradiction. Minor overwriting in “dimensional static” and “muffled clarity” slightly dilutes peak-beat precision, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final line (“gentle space between breaths”) resonates without redundancy, though one or two adjacent descriptors edge toward synonym churn (“fragile order,” “foundational stillness”).

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is pattern-taught (music metaphors evolve from “percussive rhythm” to “completed score”) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “fossilized map of time itself” slightly dilutes immediacy, but propulsion remains strong. No loops, no scaffold—just controlled lyricism that breathes with the ritual’s cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density—e.g., “walls of crystallized laughter twisted beside chasms of profound sorrow.” However, figurative language occasionally overloads high-pressure beats (“geometry shifting like liquid,” “precipice of forgotten birthdays”), creating minor muddle. No paraphrase loops, but slight syntactic uniformity in middle section. Closure line (“moment after the ripple”) is clean, yet one or two amber-rhythm/pulsing-heart descriptors verge on stock.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“frost over her spirit,” “ghostly cascade of inverted tones”—but avoids overwriting through rhythmic control. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional beats. One minor slip: “tactile symphony” borders on mixed metaphor but is redeemed by immediate grounding in physical sensation. Final line’s “stitched her back into the world’s quiet, beating heart” earns its lyricism through accumulated specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density (“rust-colored residue—a soil found only in the blighted earth”) and varied sentence architecture. Minor flaw: slight overuse of em-dashes in middle section creates minor rhythmic drag, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful (“frayed edges of her vigilance,” “truth took root like the ancient olive tree”) and never muddled. Final lines achieve resonant cadence without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is controlled (“tears... scattering tiny, crystalline shadows”) without muddle. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (“captured starlight and the gentle luminescence of forgotten dawns”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift mar peak beats. Final line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“starlight pooled like liquid silver”) is controlled and payoff-justified. Minor overwriting in one mid-paragraph (“low vibration humming… phantom imprint…”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final lines achieve crystalline clarity: “compass forged from impossible choices” ties motif to closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is purposeful (“velvety blanket smothering the land”) and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“golden thread stitching hope into absence”), but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and the final line (“companion holding space for the next note”) recharges the opening hush without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “fragile paper humming with the day’s final static charge” establishes object, atmosphere, and method simultaneously. Figurative language is consistent (static as emotional sensorium) and payoff-driven; no mixed metaphors. Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in mid-story, creating a faint rhythmic uniformity, but closure lines (“Always.”) land with perfect simplicity. No loops, scaffold, or therapy-speak—even “empathy” is dramatized through action, not label.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “salt-kissed breeze whispered through forgotten poetry volumes” merges setting, motif, and tone. Sentence variety supports rhythm—short staccato beats for tension, flowing clauses for reflection. Minor overwriting in “star-dusted canopy” and “logistics of the soul,” but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s “ripple of gratitude” risks abstraction but is anchored by concrete antecedents (locket, envelope, hands), preserving clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: “hands stained the soft green of marsh reeds,” “volcanic glass drinking the light” do double duty—character + setting. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional beats. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“bittersweet fusion of awe…”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Final chord (“chorus of belonging”) earns its lyricism through accumulated imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (“lattice of solidified soundwaves”) and peaks without muddle. Minor scaffold in “she believed echoes were sentient fragments…” could be dramatized, but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence rhythm breathes with the giant’s cadence—longer during observation, clipped during action. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; information density remains high even in reflective beats. Final line resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “the cold luminescence of the full moon filtering through a narrow fissure” establishes time, place, and mood in one breath. Figurative language is coherent (orchard as breathing entity, silence as vacuum) and peaks without muddle. Minor overwriting in “luminous tapestry” slightly softens the vision beat, but propulsion remains intact. Final line—“the moonlight her gentle guide”—resonates without redundancy, closing the sensory loop begun with stalactite light.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive: “dust motes hung suspended in the faint charcoal light” does atmosphere, time, and mood in one. Figurative language is controlled—no purple excess—and metaphors cohere (light as revelation, tape as memory-bone). Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “profound sapphire hush” repeated near climax, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s “swirling gold” image pays off earlier visual motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “moss claiming stone” conveys transformation economically; “whispered secret” avoids cliché through concrete context. Minor overwriting in “emerald velvet” slightly dilutes momentum, but figurative language remains coherent. Sentence openings vary (“She lifted,” “Memory surfaced,” “A tear traced”), and paragraphs breathe with emotional cadence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances character or atmosphere. Final line (“graceful, enduring flow”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but rarely overwritten; figurative language serves texture (“rain trails like veins,” “laughter bright as shattered glass”). Minor scaffold in “wryly earnest” repetition (used three times)—slightly redundant, though intentional for motif. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with abstract phrasing (“memory is a current”), but the dream image recovers clarity. High information density overall.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“shadows deepened into velvety pools,” “song becoming a tangible wave”—but avoids overwriting through rhythmic variation and concrete anchoring. Sentences open diversely, and paragraph lengths shift to mirror emotional cadence. One minor flaw: the phrase “fragile wonders” borders on abstraction, and “tapestry of communal resilience” risks metaphorical inflation, though both are quickly grounded in specific examples (baker’s greeting, teacher’s voice). No loops, scaffold, or simultaneity errors; momentum flows unbroken from anxiety to quiet joy.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “water-bloated ledgers,” “phantom chill of that silenced sound,” “staggered intervals of recovered truth” each do triple duty. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (salt/sorrow corrosion motif) and peaks without muddle. Final line’s “next note of heartening yet to come” recharges the trumpet motif with forward-looking poise, avoiding sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, and sentences vary in structure to support emotional cadence. However, minor overwriting occurs in the final third: “baptism of release,” “alchemical work,” and “rose-gold promise” verge on decorative abstraction. The phrase “unspooling of self-deception” leans into diagnostic label-speak, slightly dulling the embodied impact. Still, momentum holds, and the closing lines recover with concrete action—folding the map, walking on seamless pavement.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled: “ocean exhaled a rhythmic breath” sets tone without muddle. Minor scaffold in “sculpting chaos into coherence, honoring journeys witnessed and journeys taken” slightly echoes earlier phrasing, but no loops or artifacts dull closure. Final line (“sculpted not with hands, but with heart”) resonates without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is rich but mostly disciplined—figurative language serves theme and character (“boredom polished to a flawless, suffocating sheen”). Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats: “violently plucked and rewoven by the fragment’s cursed energy” slightly strains metaphor coherence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates appropriately, though “hushed thunder of his own heart” risks slight echo of earlier “hushed thunder of the mutiny.” Information density is high, with nearly every line advancing atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density: “deathly vitality” encapsulates the story’s core tension in two words. Minor scaffold appears in cumulative word counts (non-textual, ignorable per policy), but line-level craft remains strong. One slight redundancy: “charged stillness” and “deathly vitality” echo closely, though both serve thematic buildup. Final paragraph’s cadence (“balanced equation… mathematics of a fair trade”) resolves with satisfying resonance, not repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but propulsive, with high information-per-line yield: “dawn bled rose-gold,” “humming a folk tune his daughter loved,” “texture: peace.” Minor overwriting appears in early paragraphs (“twisted pine remembering mountain gales…”) but serves pattern-teaching. No loops, no scaffold—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or method. Final lines avoid redundancy, landing with crystalline economy that honors the story’s own restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: “salt-laced wind carried fragmented sentences” does triple duty (atmosphere, character trait, plot function). Minor overwriting in “monument to transience where shadows pooled deep”—slightly purple but paid off by later “ghost” motif. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“He moved,” “His motivation,” “Today’s receding tide”). Final line’s “ready to collect the next whisper” perfectly echoes opening rhythm without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is selective and coherent (e.g., “myth transform from puzzle to legacy” avoids mixed metaphors). Minor overwriting in “cinematic clarity” and “universal riddle” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops or scaffold mar key beats. Final paragraph’s rhythm—long then short sentences—mirrors resolution, and the closing line (“meant only for loving preservation”) earns its lyricism through prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (nautilus as map, stars as safe houses) and never muddled. Minor scaffold appears in “his orderly mind placed symbols… his intuition guided flourishes”—a near-paraphrase—but it’s brief and functional. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with pacing, and the final line (“the carnival’s heart still beat strong”) resonates without sentimentality. No register drift or syntactic monotony undermines the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm mirrors the narrative arc—slow, measured during vigil; taut at dawn. Minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in the final paragraph (“glowing rim,” “last light of the old world”) borders on the ornamental, though it serves tone. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts breathe with emotional cadence. Closure image is clear, resonant, and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: “mist-coated rail depot breathed with the slow pulse of steam and distant tide” establishes setting, mood, and rhythm in one breath. Figurative language is pattern-taught (water as eye, light as map) and paid off at closure. Minor overwriting in “jeweled wings dull, its guidance crystal fractured” slightly dilutes urgency, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors the “flowing river of time” it describes.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “crystalline ice dust,” “frost-feathers,” “sky-written map” all serve theme and character. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor artifact: “worrying tranquility” repeats slightly, but not distractingly. No paraphrase loops or scaffold—each line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Closure beat (“ice, breath, and a dog-eared page”) is clean, resonant, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught early (“wind held its breath,” “silence thick with… footsteps”) and paid off in closure (“wild hush… full of listening”). Minor overwriting in mid-text (“translucent figures shimmered… before fading like gentle breath”) borders on decorative but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths modulate pace. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Final lines (“path ahead wound toward other silent valleys…”) resonate without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “crimson pulse... lonely metronome” establishes rhythm without purple overload. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“woven tapestry of stillness,” “memory-knot”) and paid off in closure. Minor scaffold in “bittersweet anchor to purpose” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or mixed metaphors. Final line (“holding a dawn that would never fade”) recharges the ephemeral motif with earned resonance. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, avoiding syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information-per-line (“scars of silence,” “wings catching copperlight like whispered prayers”). Minor overwriting in mid-story (“profound quiet of a truth finally witnessed”) slightly dilutes propulsion. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one near-redundancy: “hush” and “silence” occasionally blur. Closure image remains sharp despite lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but largely controlled, with strong information density: “her form a ripple of sorrow and resolve” conveys state, metaphor, and movement in one phrase. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats—e.g., “harmonic tremors deep into the soil” followed by “silver blossoms unfurled with a soft chime”—where two adjacent lines restate resonance effects. No fatal loops, but this slight redundancy prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“needle dipping into a fissure marked by her sleepwalking foot on the crescent moon”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “hauntingly optimistic resolve settled in her bones” edges toward label-speak, and “fragile ceramic disc painted with cobalt and ochre” slightly stalls momentum. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one instance of elevated diction (“alchemized”) risks register drift. Final paragraph’s rhythm is masterful, with “orchid’s fragrance clinging like a kept promise” closing the sensory loop cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “roots cradling bones like tender guardians” conveys setting, theme, and tone). Figurative language is coherent—light/shadow motifs never contradict—and rhythm varies purposefully. Minor overwriting in “cautious enchantment so profound she felt the veil... thin to gossamer” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“living shadow—a quiet promise...”) earns its lyricism through prior accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths. Information density is high—each line advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“delicate ecosystem of sound, history, and hidden emotional resonance”), but figurative language is largely coherent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; however, slight thesaurus-itis (“nano-forged gold alloy,” “fleeting digital ghosts”) nudges density toward ornament in two early lines.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: “crimson leaves swirled like embers” establishes season, color motif, and tension in seven words. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“tapestry of lies woven with meticulous care”) slightly dilutes momentum, though not clarity. Sentence openings vary effectively; paragraph cuts serve rhythm (e.g., short punch after “conspiracy unraveled”). No loops or scaffold—each line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language remains coherent (threads = truth, flame = insight) without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density: “phosphorescent singing spirits wove haunting harmonies from echoes of forgotten sorrows” establishes setting, tone, and thematic premise in one breath. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“fierce yet tender,” “compassionate certainty”), but peak beats avoid figurative muddle. Sentence variety supports emotional arc, though two adjacent lines restate “unspoken apology” conceptually—a faint paraphrase loop costing 0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line efficiency. Metaphors are consistent (coral = complexity of worry; dark = anesthesia/fear) and never mixed. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent lines (“sorrow for shared vulnerability intertwined with resilient, blooming hope” / “lotus-hearted ache”)—slight synonym churn—but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe, and rhythm supports emotional cadence. No scaffold or loops mar key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Rhythm varies purposefully—cadence slows during the daydream, tightens during calibration. Minor overwriting in “ghost-sounds: a fiddle’s tune, a child’s giggle, the rustle of silk dresses” edges toward list-like delivery, but this is offset by strong verbs (“bloomed,” “dissolved,” “receded”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; the final line (“a bridge now spanned centuries”) cleanly recharges the opening imagery without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “wind chimes of tuned crystal painted cerulean ripples” does triple duty (sound, color, motion). Figurative language is coherent—sound as light, pigment as resonance—and never muddles causality. One minor slip: “gentle bewitchment washed over Elara—not as enchantment, but as perception expanding” slightly over-explains, but immediately redeemed by embodied action. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“twilight bled through the glass,” “root pushing through darkness”), and sentences vary rhythmically to match scene intensity. Minor overwriting appears in mid-text (“elegant subversion,” “living manuscript of dissent”), slightly reducing propulsion, but peak beats remain clear. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final paragraph achieves high information density without muddle, though “candidly cryptic” borders on label-use in the penultimate line.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional figurative stacking risks slight overwriting (“pearlescent walls, smooth as forgotten promises,” “sharp thorns of insomnia into verses that bloomed like night-blooming cereus”). Sentence openings vary effectively; rhythm breathes with the narrative arc. One minor paraphrase loop: “ensconced himself” appears twice in close proximity. Despite this, information density remains high—each line advances character, atmosphere, or theme—and the final paragraph’s propulsion is flawless. Closure image is undulled by artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“her slender fingers checked each orchid… vessels forged from enchanted glass”). Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught—“foxglove regret,” “solidified mist”—without muddle or overwriting. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching the ritual’s cadence. One minor slip: “deserted marvels” slightly abstract in final paragraph, but immediately grounded by “tended with gently systematic care,” preserving clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: sentences multitask (e.g., “silver particles… swirled like captured starlight” conveys setting, mood, and object function). Rhythm varies effectively—longer cadences for reflection, shorter for tension. Minor overwriting in “symphonies of truth” repetitions, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s “cautious exuberance… fortified” risks slight abstraction, yet remains anchored in bodily warmth and dawn light.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor overwriting in “mechanical sonnet of protection and provision”—slightly ornamental—but quickly grounded by concrete action. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“Sunlight fractured...”, “Slung across...”, “Tucked in...”). The only flaw: “encrypted compassion” appears twice in close proximity (lines 116, 228), bordering on redundant emphasis, though justified by thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language (“tiny historian,” “fragile bloom pushing through withering soil”) is coherent and purposeful, never muddled. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; even peak beats avoid therapy-speak. Final line (“a tiny anchor between worlds…”) recharges the meteorite motif with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional figurative stacking (“fractured hush,” “tapestry of understood truths”) risks slight overwriting. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor register drift in “profound sense of belonging” edges toward abstraction, but is grounded immediately by “unfamiliar contours.” Information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “shadowseam wonder,” “luminous respite,” “burnt feather” each do thematic, atmospheric, and narrative work. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“tears traced clean paths through the salt on her cheeks”) slightly dilutes immediacy, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies skillfully; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One near-redundancy (“fragile magic” / “fleeting beauty”) prevents a 9.0+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or knowledge (“gold for joy, deep blue for grief”). Figurative language is coherent (memories like “dew on a web,” sorrow as “comforting cloak”) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in peak beats—e.g., “ghostly ship under stars, a tearful reunion”—edges toward purple but remains legible. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are precise. Final line (“steady lantern through all her days”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled (“tidal arcade’s ancient stone embrace”) and coheres with the Accumulative lens. Minor overwriting in “serenaded monotony” risks abstraction but is grounded by immediate tactile detail. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“Beneath his worn boots…”, “Moving to the seventh arch…”, “Then, slow, weary footsteps…”). Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors tide and cello—propulsive yet meditative.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “obsidian grace,” “breath-held spaces,” “fertile void” do triple duty (image, theme, rhythm). Minor overwriting in two high-pressure lines (“luminous map of courage,” “cosmic defiance”) slightly muddles focus, but clarity at closure remains intact. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops or scaffold—each image advances plot or character.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“Her boots made no sound on stones slick with sea mist, a path worn smooth by years of solitary visits”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Figurative language is coherent (water as script, light as revelation) and pattern-taught. Minor overwriting appears in “noctilucent reckonings” and “ethereal blues and silvers glowing with inner fire,” but these serve the accumulative texture without muddling clarity. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“She would mend glass not as chore, but as covenant”) earns its lyricism through concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery, but occasional overwriting dilutes propulsion—e.g., “hard softness of the night enveloped him” risks abstraction despite contextual grounding. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“fracture”/“crack”/“brokenness” recur without sufficient variation in function). However, rhythm supports mood, sentence openings vary, and key lines (“scars were not wounds, but words”) land with clarity. Final paragraph avoids scaffold, though “fragile light of shared humanity” flirts with vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“cathedral of stone smoothed by centuries of patient ocean breath”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentences vary in structure and length, supporting the ritual’s cadence. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“concentrated intentions launched like silent seeds across parallel timelines”), but figurative language remains coherent and pattern-taught. Final lines (“polishing the world, wave by gentle wave, toward dawn”) resonate without muddle, though one or two modifiers edge toward purple (e.g., “liquid gold”).

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information density (“ivory-veiled passage,” “black mouth of ash and time”). Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“soul heavy with legacy’s burden” borders on label-speak), and “sensitively perceptive nature” recurs slightly mechanically. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one adjacent redundancy: “fragments was a soul’s echo demanding guardianship, a responsibility she carried…” could be tighter. Final lines avoid purple prose, maintaining clarity through concrete action (“sealed in a cloth-lined case”).

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but generally purposeful, with high information density: “gleaming like scattered obsidian” establishes mood, texture, and setting in one stroke. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“amber light into visible waves that washed over the silvered glass like liquid hope”)—a slight figurative density that borders on excess but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter mar momentum. Closure image remains sharp despite ornamental risk.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density (“each step a prayer on stone older than the war itself”). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—obsidian, ash, blooming sigils—all reinforcing theme without muddle. Minor overwriting in “slow dance of celestial bodies” slightly dilutes immediacy, but rhythm varies effectively (short staccato beats during tension, longer cadences at reflection). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully, with paragraph cuts that heighten emotional beats. Minor overwriting appears in early figurative density (“a million precise cracks,” “cartography of loss”), but it serves pattern-teaching. No loops or scaffold; the final third avoids artifacts, though “fractured grace” slightly risks label-speak—redeemed by immediate embodiment in the tear.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “serpents of captured starlight,” “syrupy wave promising rest” verge on mixed metaphor. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, minor scaffold exists (“her movement was inherently bodily poetic” followed by near-redundant elaboration). No paraphrase loops, but figurative density in the central knot section slightly obscures immediacy. Still, line-level propulsion remains strong, and the final lines achieve crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density and rhythmic control dominate, but minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “half-lit epiphany crystallized with quiet force” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, and “meteor hush” recurs with slight redundancy. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines (“His puppet shows… denied that reciprocity; he alone controlled…”) verge on restatement. These artifacts don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+ eligibility per Q7 guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“diamond dew,” “frantic pulse, a tiny drum against oblivion”) and high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Rhythm varies naturally: long, lyrical sentences for ritual; short, tactile phrases for crisis. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“sapphire-veined and dusted with silver”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; closure image (“tear tracing a clean path through the soil”) is crystalline and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density: “technically gentle fingers translating each hole into a specific fiber crossing” merges action, character, and method. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with scene needs, and figurative language (“liquid dawn,” “river of remembrance”) is coherent and payoff-driven. Minor overwriting in “snowmelt ardor” repetition (lines 42, 224, 303) triggers a −0.3 artifact penalty, but clarity at closure remains intact. No loops, scaffold, or simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“rain was a baptism, not a punishment”) and rhythmic control. Minor overwriting in dream sequence (“river flowed uphill… clockwork sparrow sang a melody that was also a map”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent (light = understanding, path = agency). Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully balances grit and grace, though one or two modifiers (“precisely playful”) verge on ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density—each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the climax (“bleeding” sky, “screaming truth,” “pulsed with covenant warmth”), risking overwriting. No paraphrase loops, but “encrypted devotion” recurs four times, nearing thematic echo. Closure beat remains clear despite density, though “dusky harmony” borders on abstract label in final lines. Read-aloud rhythm falters slightly in mid-story descriptive clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (“sound was not merely absent but consumed”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (sound as pressure, reality as convulsion) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “river of liquid light flowing upward” slightly distracts, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. The line “cellular memory delivered the final truth” edges toward label-speak but is immediately grounded in maternal voice.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“boots crunched on frost-rimed soil, the only sharp sound in a world of whispers”). Figurative language is coherent—glass, light, and breath motifs interweave without muddle. Rhythm varies naturally: staccato openings (“She assessed its wounds”) yield to fluid breath-cadence during synchronization. No loops or scaffolding; final line (“glass mountains... became windows”) recharges the opening with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“amber tears,” “feisty resolve,” “whispering leaves”—but avoids overwriting by grounding metaphors in physical action. Sentence variety supports rhythm: periodic sentences for setting, paratactic for urgency. One minor flaw: “accidental wisdom bloomed” edges toward abstraction, though it’s immediately anchored by the ribbon’s use. No loops or scaffold; every line advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors the story’s ethos—quiet, resonant, earned.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “droplets coalesce and float… like tiny, liquid planets” advances atmosphere, character (low-gravity familiarity), and theme (fragmented clarity). Figurative language is coherent—orchard as tapestry, cameos as vessels—and avoids purple excess. Minor scaffold in “deep, persistent bewilderment” slightly dulls immediacy, but no loops or artifacts touch closure. Sentence variety and paragraph cuts serve rhythm, though one adjacent paraphrase (“breathtaking example… profound depth”) warrants a −0.1 nudge.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere (“edges fraying like torn vellum” conveys dissolution and materiality). Rhythm varies purposefully: long, winding sentences for discovery; short clauses for crisis (“She took a slow breath…”). One minor flaw: “whispering corridors” slightly echoes earlier “whispered pages,” risking faint synonym churn, but not enough to obscure clarity. Final line’s “conducting the symphony of what could be” recharges the “unheard symphony” motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “splintered railing,” “mournful fog,” “water-stained yet clear” do triple duty. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors; “physical hollow in her chest” avoids cliché through specificity. Minor redundancy in “narrative threads” repetition (lines 12/42), but payoff justifies it. Closure beat (“garden had been here all along”) lands cleanly without scaffold. One near-loop: “trapped freedom” echoes slightly, but tonal purpose redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “sunlight fractured,” “oil-stained floorboards,” “crimson silk, silver thread, and iron wire” all advance atmosphere and theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in one peak beat (“every crossover of thread was a conscious act… every tightened knot, a commitment”) edges toward abstraction but recovers quickly. No loops, scaffold, or register drift—clarity holds even in figurative passages.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“ripple-mark mapkeeper,” “fractured echoes dissolved into a single, deep hum”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional arc.

Read-aloud rhythm supports thematic cadence without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency: “twilight bled into deep indigo” conveys time, mood, and visual tone in five words. Figurative language is consistent (light as language, hope as thistle) and never muddled. One minor slip: “weathered cheeks” borders on cliché, but it’s redeemed by “clean paths through the dust.” No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence swells perfectly with the beacon’s rekindling.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (e.g., “summer-quill, carved from solstice-harvested reed…” conveys lore, function, and symbolism in one phrase). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors—and varies naturally in rhythm. Minor overwriting in one high-pressure beat (“visceral echo: the crystal whispering forecourt after rain”) slightly slows momentum, but clarity at closure remains intact. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush but precise, with high information density: “dusk bled into absolute dark,” “perfume so thick it felt like walking through liquid memory.” Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe, and figurative language serves perception, not decoration. One minor flaw: slight overuse of compound modifiers (“moss-fringed archway,” “starless void,” “buoyant weight”) in mid-text risks ornamental density, though never obscuring clarity. Closure remains sharp, and propulsion never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously (e.g., “starlight fractured... illuminating a hermit crab’s hesitant dance” establishes setting, symbol, and emotional state). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“granular feel of moments suspended between loss and renewal”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary purposefully. Figurative coherence maintained—biological metaphors (cicada, crab, anemone) interlock without contradiction. Final paragraph’s “tide reclaiming stone” resonates without purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“phantom pressure on her ribs,” “liquid amber poured over her skin”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“luminous presence that felt intangibly tangible”) slightly muddles metaphor coherence, costing 0.1 from 9.0. Zero loops or scaffolds; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line’s “taste like freedom” risks abstraction but is anchored by preceding sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “liquid light,” “grief-shadowed eyes,” “crystalline expanse” do triple duty (atmosphere, character, theme). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with the scene’s rhythm. Minor overwriting in “vaulting hush” repetition (three times), but it serves tonal reinforcement. No paraphrase loops or scaffold—each image advances pressure. Final line (“sanctuary where noise was monitored…”) resonates without redundancy. Figurative logic holds: prisms refract, vial clarifies, silence “waits.”

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but propulsive: “liquid light shifting through hues of forgotten nebulae and drowned sunsets” does atmosphere, theme, and orientation in one. Minimal scaffolding; nearly every sentence advances plot or character. One slight overwriting risk: “kaleidoscopic waterfall churned in silent symphony” borders on stacked modifiers, but payoff justifies it. No loops, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks; rhythm varies naturally across tension gradients.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is pattern-taught (shadows as sentient smoke, breath as lifeline) and pays off at closure.

No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines (“Memories flooded him… He understood…”) verge on explanatory summary. Final paragraph’s rhythm is masterful—each sentence advances image, emotion, and theme without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“High above…”, “Beneath…”, “Today…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “intricate map of its journey,” “fragile prophecies,” “resilient joy” verge on stacked modifiers. No paraphrase loops, but figurative language appears in most sentences of the climax without diluting clarity. Closure remains sharp, so artifact penalty is light.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“oil and patience,” “swirling leaves... farewell dance”) and strong verbs (“struck metal,” “trembled, spun”). Minor overwriting in “majestic subterranean waterfall cascaded into an obsidian pool”—slightly ornamental—but quickly grounded by functional moss-light. No loops or scaffold; rhythm supports pressure. Final paragraph’s cadence recharges motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or action. Figurative language is controlled (“sapphire flames,” “molten forgiveness”) and coherent within the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“amber rivers,” “constellation of poetic fragments”) but avoids overwriting in peak beats—the storm sequence uses short, clear sentences (“She adjusted… activated… bloomed”). Minor scaffold: “tears traced warm paths” slightly echoes “polished ache” later, but not redundantly. No loops or mixed metaphors; chroniton logic holds. Final line (“sorrowful, sacred light”) perfectly recharges the opening’s “quiet regret,” achieving high information density without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every line advances character, theme, or pressure. Rhythm varies skillfully—long, resonant sentences for ritual; staccato fragments during wilt (“Knees buckled; he gripped the bench”). One minor flaw: “crystalline note of pure C bloomed” slightly over-ornaments, but it’s isolated and serves the sonic motif. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image (“tinkersong wonder woven into stone”) is earned and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “obsidian water so perfectly still it seemed to swallow light and sound alike” exemplifies high information density. Minor scaffold in “psychometry reading” beat (slight tell vs. show), but no loops or register drift. Figurative language is coherent (water as silence, compass as truth-seeker). Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors ascent—lighter, resolved—without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“wind screamed through the opening, yet within its curve, a pocket of calm held”) and rhythmic variety, avoiding syntactic monotony. Figurative language is pattern-taught (hum as heartbeat, wood as diary) and pays off in closure. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “each shaving released tension; each curve was a whispered dialogue” edges toward stacked modifiers, and “tears warmed her wind-chilled cheeks—not sorrow, but connection” risks therapy-speak. These don’t obscure causality but slightly dilute immediacy; no paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences mar momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density (e.g., “dancing dust motes were tiny stars celebrating brief lives” merges setting, theme, and action). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “silver scar across the heavens” and “liquid gold” verge on purple, slightly muddling clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines (“He felt their heat... vulnerability he honored deeply”) edge toward conceptual redundancy. Sentence openings vary, rhythm supports scene needs, and the final line (“tended the stillness... spirit to flourish”) resonates without restating.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme—but occasional figurative stacking (“fragile scar of green memory,” “sorrowful posture of spectral figures”) risks slight overwriting in early beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary effectively. Closure beat remains lucid: “dissolved into the stars with a sigh of release” avoids muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“woven dawns,” “fractured shell”) and pays off in the feather-quill metaphor. Minor overwriting in opening paragraph (“polished to liquid obsidian,” “sky washed clean”) borders on purple, but momentum holds. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively. Final deduction: one adjacent redundancy—“fractured moment” followed by “harmonizing its discord”—slightly dulls peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose exhibits exceptional density: nearly every line advances character, setting, or theme (“copper wire salvaged from the lighthouse bell” implies history without digression). Sentence openings vary naturally; paragraph lengths breathe with the ritual cadence. Zero loops or scaffold—each wire wrap is distinct in effect (pillar three’s resistance vs. western oak’s brightening). Figurative language remains coherent (copper as “language of care,” network as “map of reverence”) and never muddles the climax’s physical-emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“obsidian stones gleaming,” “tears cutting clean paths through dust”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentences vary in structure and length, creating a natural read-aloud cadence.

Otherwise, every phrase advances atmosphere, character, or theme, with high information density and no scaffold clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is rich but mostly disciplined; figurative language serves theme and character without overwhelming momentum. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “bruised violet sky” and “chlorophyll and light,” which verge on decorative abstraction, but these are offset by concrete anchors (“gnarled hands,” “splintered piling,” “dust on Kael’s cheeks”). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift purposefully, and information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. No loops or scaffold; the only slight blemish is a hairline register drift in “silent, persistent argument for peace,” which edges toward editorializing.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “lantern light pooling around him,” “tears traced clean paths through the dust.” Figurative language is purposeful (leaf veins as “frozen echo”) and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “vivid, painful detail—the scent of rain… a symphony of absence” edges toward summary, but it’s brief and anchored in present action (tracing leaf). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional beats, and information density is high (e.g., “scraps of skeletal vehicles and shattered dreams” conveys setting, history, and tone in one phrase).

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information yield per line—e.g., “light from ancient suns arrived fractured, smeared across minutes like ink on wet paper” merges setting, theme, and method.

Rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No scaffold or AI-pattern artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “muscles burning but spirit alight” establishes embodied contrast in six words. Figurative language is purposeful (“needle of ancient ice piercing the cloud sea”) and avoids muddle—each metaphor serves Kael’s reverence. Minor artifact: slight template cadence in middle swaps (“He swapped… Bishops followed… The corrupted queen…”), but it’s taught early and pays off in ritualistic rhythm. Closure beat is pristine: “golden light erupted, washing over Kael with the warmth of forgiveness” ties sensory detail to thematic cost without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“dust motes like scattered stars”) and paid off in the luminous absence. Minor overwriting in “skeletal streets” and “nomadic penumbra” risks abstraction, but these are grounded by immediate tactile detail (cracked stone, worn coat). No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, though the opening sentence’s complexity slightly stalls momentum before the second paragraph’s propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“shattered glass” pain echoes earlier “mercury-glass”) and never muddled. Minor artifact: “exquisite pain of remembering” slightly drifts into label-speak, but it’s redeemed two lines later by embodied action (“knuckles brushed a cold anomaly”). Final paragraph’s rhythm—“With each footfall…”—perfectly modulates closure. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; information density is high without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“raindrops hung motionless like scattered diamonds” establishes setting and stakes). Figurative language is pattern-taught (chess motifs, weaving metaphors) and payoff-earned.

Figurative language is pattern-taught (kintsugi as narrative spine) and avoids muddle; metaphors like “quilting memories” are coherent. Minor scaffold in cumulative word counts (artifact of prompt) doesn’t obscure clarity, but one paraphrase loop (“fracture to pockmark… chaotic grief wove into mosaic”) slightly dulls momentum. Final lines achieve crystalline resonance without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density: “grief is a treacherous guide” does triple duty (character, tone, causality). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“ethereal glow on walls worn smooth by time”)—a touch ornamental—but doesn’t obscure clarity. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the tide.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is purposeful (“rational truffle forager”) and consistent, though slightly dense in the opening (“quiet precision of a rational truffle forager” borders on over-compression). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively. Minor deduction for one ornamental phrase (“testament to endurance”) that slightly stalls momentum, but closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “bruise of violet and silver,” “leather cover cracked like old ice,” “tapestry of shared humanity” all advance atmosphere and theme. Minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in mid-section (“borrowed memories,” “woven into that cloth”) risks density overload, though pattern is taught early. No loops or scaffold; every sentence propels. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors the sweeping beam—cyclical, steady, luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “sunlight struck the chip, and it emitted a distinct, deliberate glimmer” advances plot, character, and atmosphere in one clause. Figurative language is restrained in high-pressure beats (ants “commuting with purpose” avoids purple prose). Minor scaffold in “solitude was both comfort and cage” borders on cliché but is redeemed by immediate concrete grounding (“scent of aging linen maps”). No loops or synonym churn; every sentence earns its place. Final line’s “smallest guides home” echoes opening’s “quiet spaces” with earned resonance, not redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “lacey menace of the whispering pines” conveys atmosphere, threat, and texture). Minor overwriting in “liquid radiance dripped steadily, each drop sizzling softly” slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors ascent-to-return arc. One near-redundancy (“delicate, intricate danger” / “delicate, dangerous, and beautiful work”) costs 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: “pocket held a captured dawn—a sun no larger than a pea, pulsing with gentle heat against her thigh” conveys object, scale, sensation, and intimacy in one breath. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“gold of cherished memory gilded Lyra’s tear-streaked smile”) edges toward lyric redundancy but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence variety sustains momentum; no scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks. Closure image remains sharp despite rich figurative layering.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “granite headstone,” “fibrous surface,” “corrosive jealousy” all do double duty in advancing character and atmosphere. Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., the gasp upon waking). One minor flaw: the phrase “jaded wonder” appears twice in close proximity, slightly diluting its impact—a hairline loop that doesn’t obscure closure but prevents a 9+. Otherwise, no scaffold, no purple excess; figurative language remains coherent (soaring as sanctuary, scroll as compass). Final line’s propulsion—“still being written with every breath”—resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and purposeful—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language (“breathed in liquid time,” “pouring intention”) is consistent and payoff-driven, not ornamental.

Final line’s “quiet click… unwavering flow” recharges opening motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“The inkwell… crystallized when stressed, turning intention into glittering dust”). Rhythm varies naturally, with paragraph cuts serving emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in one beat (“tiny crystals blooming like frost”) edges toward density excess, but figurative language remains coherent. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image (“stories etched in light”) is clear and resonant without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or thematic resonance. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“dust motes swirled… like restless spirits”) and paid off in the spirit’s coalescence. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “ethereal grit coated her soul”—a near-mixed metaphor—but it lands cleanly in the closure. Sentence variety, paragraph rhythm, and concrete verbs (“bit,” “shattered,” “uncorked”) sustain momentum without scaffold or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line efficiency. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“resounding hush,” “shimmering cosmic illusions”) and paid off in closure. Minor overwriting in “universe’s hiccup fracturing reality into shimmering cosmic illusions”—“shimmering” and “cosmic” slightly redundant. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively. Final paragraph’s cadence (“stars burned… silence hummed… began the spiral descent”) masterfully balances closure and continuation.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“iron teardrop,” “watercolor wash of indigo and rose”) is consistent and never contradictory. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with the ritual’s cadence, and the final lines resonate without redundancy. No loops, no scaffold—only clean, evocative propulsion. The “plink” of the droplet is a masterstroke of sonic closure, echoing the whistle’s absence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or concept. Figurative language is purposeful (“cathedral of release,” “quiet wildfire”) and coheres within the bioluminescent motif. Minor overwriting in “sanctuary hidden deep beneath the sleeping world” slightly dilutes immediacy, and “calibrated precision” edges toward jargon. Otherwise, syntax varies effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (mica as perspective filter) and paid off at closure. Minor redundancy in “clover melancholy” phrasing (used three times) slightly dulls momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Rhythm varies skillfully—paragraph lengths breathe with Elara’s movement from stillness to transit. Final line (“carried the clover melancholy… as a compass”) crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense, musical, and varied in syntax—sentences breathe or accelerate with scene needs. High information density: “drip of water became a metronome tick” does triple duty. Minor overwriting in “melodically haunted” phrasing borders on label-like but is redeemed by immediate embodiment. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; final paragraph avoids redundancy. One near-mixed metaphor (“symphony wove threads of hope”) slightly blurs imagery but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or ritual. Figurative language (“fragrant waterfall of pale blossoms,” “steam rose like a ghost”) is coherent and purposeful. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “gently thorough” (twice)—a near-redundancy—but not enough to obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm is impeccable.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful: “sunlight fractured through centuries of emerald vines” does setting, mood, and time in one stroke. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm (short during tension, longer in reflection). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. However, two adjacent sentences near the climax—“Reciprocity was the catalyst—not the object, but the courage to give and receive. Her motivation transformed...”—edge toward explanatory telling, slightly dulling the immediacy of her realization. Figurative language remains coherent (ivy as decay/resilience, ink-like time), but “polite anarchy” introduces a faintly academic register.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (musical notes, emotional cartography) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“skin drank stories… sapling’s joy, fallen log’s decay”)—slightly abstract for peak pressure. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near line 183–189 (“mapping healing’s emotional resonance” echoes prior “mental melody”). Read-aloud rhythm is strong, though cadence occasionally borders on incantatory.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “spacetime pooled like spilled ink” conveys physics, mood, and metaphor in one stroke. Sentence openings vary purposefully (“Her breath fogged...” / “Clutched in her gloved hand...” / “Closing her eyes...”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One minor flaw: “strange comfort” appears thrice, bordering on refrain but risking slight redundancy; however, each iteration deepens its meaning (despair → acceptance → resonance), so it reads as intentional patterning. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats—the unbending sequence is crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Rhythm varies effectively, with paragraph lengths mirroring the ebb and flow of the harbor. Minor overwriting in opening lines (“liquid silver pooling between the gentle swells”) risks slight figurative density, but pattern is taught and pays off in the tactile final image. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure beat is clean and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “boots whispered across the dust-choked floor” establishes tone and setting in one breath. Figurative language is coherent (fire/ember/dew motifs evolve without contradiction), though “volcanic tenderness” slightly risks mixed metaphor. Minor scaffold in “method left by the civilization’s last archivist” could be tighter, but line-level propulsion remains strong. Final paragraph’s “green shoot of redemption” avoids sentimentality by grounding it in tactile action (carrying melody, not abstract hope).

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and varied syntax, though occasional figurative stacking (“auroral sorrow saturated the air, a luminous grief holding both the beauty of what was lost and the fragile promise of its return”) risks slight overwriting. No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. The final chime lingers with perfect economy. Minor deduction for two adjacent high-metaphor sentences in the climax, but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “boots whispered across gravel” establishes sound motif, character trait, and setting simultaneously. Figurative language is purposeful (“violent ribbons of emerald” ties storm to emotional stakes) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “smooth edge of the Pisces zodiac coin… its scales a silent reminder” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops or register drift. Final line (“enduring power of a single, well-placed word”) resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose achieves high information density: “puddles trapped fractured reflections” conveys setting, mood, and metaphor in seven words. Figurative language is coherent—water/stars/light motifs interweave without muddle. Minor overwriting in “spiralingly calm” (repeated twice) slightly dilutes impact, but no loops or scaffold mar peak beats. Final paragraph’s cadence (“forever ready to weave light…”) resolves with earned simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: varied sentence openings, high information density (“breath pluming, their unspoken words forming a symphony only he could hear”), and concrete verbs (“cradled,” “coiled,” “kissed”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image advances theme or character. Minor deduction for two adjacent figurative phrases (“magnetic grotto under starlight—a miniature cave… crowned by a dome painted with silver constellations”) that slightly over-ornament, though the grotto’s specificity justifies it. Final paragraph’s rhythm—short, declarative, then tender—perfectly modulates closure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies naturally—long, fluid lines for memory; clipped phrases for release. Minor overwriting in “metallic taste of fear, the hollow victory of plunder” slightly blurs distinctness, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent (whale song as “melody woven with loss”), though “combative tenderness” appears three times, risking slight redundancy. Closure beat remains sharp, undulled by artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. One minor overwriting slip: “carving the gray sky into measured segments of silence and sound” borders on mixed metaphor but pays off later in the “remade hush.” No loops, scaffold, or register drift; information density remains high without sacrificing clarity. Final line earns its lyric weight through accumulated particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful: metaphors (“frozen wave,” “watercolor on wet paper”) serve the theme. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats—e.g., “tremor of certainty coursed through them a quiet unshakable conviction” stacks clauses—but clarity remains intact. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final lines avoid purple prose, landing cleanly on “promise kept.” One slight redundancy (“dissolve with grace” echoes earlier phrasing) prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-sensory imagery and rhythmic control, varying sentence length to mirror emotional cadence (e.g., short staccato phrases during Kael’s shame, flowing lines during awakening). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. One near-overwriting moment: “golden texture, a vibration painting light across her mind” edges toward abstraction but is redeemed by immediate grounding in bodily sensation (“humming deep within Elara’s bones”). Final line’s “imperfect and profound” risks cliché but lands due to earned context.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“shadows pooled like liquid amber,” “prism-song”), but occasionally overwrites in high-pressure beats (e.g., “fertile silence and intentional light to awaken” borders on label-speak). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor scaffold in “precision maps the skeleton / connection is the living breath”—a near-paraphrase loop. No clarity loss at closure, but figurative density slightly dulls propulsion in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “calloused palms” conveys profession, emotion, and physicality). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “subdued ardor,” “timeless sanctuary” verge on abstraction but are grounded immediately by concrete action. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Figurative coherence holds—“withering to bloom” motif ties tools, fungi, and grief without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: “rain beaded the vast, curved skylight” establishes setting, mood, and motif in one phrase. Syntax varies purposefully—long descriptive clauses yield to terse dialogue. Minor overwriting in “nervous system in deep black ink” risks mixed metaphor, but payoff in “constellation of collective healing” redeems it. No loops or scaffold; every sentence propels character, theme, or atmosphere. Closure beat remains unmarred by artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (e.g., “atoms of nostalgia—tiny, crystalline echoes of laughter, grief, and first light”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “anguished joy” repeated, and “steadily unpredictable” slightly abstract. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one register drift (“sentimental blindness” borders on diagnostic). Final paragraph’s lyricism avoids purple prose by anchoring abstractions in concrete images (tears on dust, saffron veil as banner).

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful—“archways of woven light,” “dream-vines cascading,” “luminous regret”—with high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “oil lamp casting protective shadows” conveys mood, setting, and theme in seven words. Sentence openings vary (“A dense...”, “Inside...”, “Elara...”, “The con...”), avoiding monotony. Minor overwriting in “quietly vivid tapestry of sensory details”—“tapestry” borders on mixed metaphor with “hummed.” One paraphrase loop: “fragile convictions” (line 96) and “tempered... convictions” (line 314) could tighten. Closure beat remains clear; no artifact penalties beyond −0.5.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and musical, though occasionally over-figured (“meteor hush,” “verdant wave”). No loops or scaffold—each sentence advances character or atmosphere.

Final line (“And the glowing dune bloomed brighter with him”) resolves with perfect propulsion, recharging the opening image without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density, syntactic variety, and zero paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but coherent—“ticking ferns,” “clockwork flower”—with no mixed metaphors. Minor deduction for two adjacent lines near the end (“He remembered early days… patience had taught him”) that lightly summarize rather than dramatize. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with cumulative abstraction, but the closing image (“next small gear waiting to be found”) restores momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally risking overwriting (“leash of long sorrow snapped silently,” “tears had dried into wisdom”), but the pattern is taught early and pays off in the closing lullaby motif. Minor paraphrase-loop in “gently persistent” repetition (used three times), slightly dulling immediacy. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. No syntactic monotony or scaffold clutter, though one or two stacked modifiers blur sense under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language (“shard of frozen sky,” “landscape of mending nerves”) is coherent and grounded.

No paraphrase loops or scaffold—each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. The closing lines achieve high information density without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “steam rose in ghostly plumes” does atmosphere + motif work; “calloused fingers brushed something smooth” merges tactile detail with plot. Minor overwriting in glyph description (“spiral for cyclical heat… droplet for life-giving water”) edges toward explanatory, but payoff justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “somatic echo of the drone’s final whine flooding her senses” borders on mixed metaphor. A few adjacent lines paraphrase (“memory honored without being haunted” / “realistic weight, but her heart felt balanced”), triggering slight redundancy. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports emotional cadence. Final paragraph avoids scaffold, though “each droplet was a promise” leans toward declarative neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“sunlight… fell in weak diamonds,” “threads spilled like liquid starlight”), but occasional overwriting risks clarity—e.g., “visceral manifestation of the timeframe when the walls close in” slightly muddles spatial and temporal logic. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though one or two metaphors verge on mixed (“hollow silence,” “luminescent ache” repeated without evolution). Final lines land with clean propulsion, avoiding purple excess at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

    High information density: every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“contraband truths in its purest, most corrosive form”). Rhythm varies effectively—longer descriptive sentences yield to short, sharp beats during crisis (“Time fractured… Her thumb pressed transmit”). Minor figurative density in the opening paragraph (“cathedral of frozen memory”) slightly risks overwriting, but it’s pattern-taught and pays off in the thaw imagery. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“teardrop of hope,” “tranquil blaze,” “engraved quiet”—but avoids overwriting by grounding metaphors in action (tying stems, sheathing knives). Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and every line advances character or atmosphere. One minor flaw: “senselessly perceptive” edges toward label-speak, though it’s quickly embodied. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; the final paragraph’s propulsion is flawless, making the closure image resonate without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “rivers of liquid melody flowed over obsidian stones” conveys setting, mood, and physics in one stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “rust-flecked iron grating,” “quivering hush,” “persistent glow that whispered rather than shouted.” Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats—e.g., “fragile silence vibrating with potential, as if the night itself held its breath”—where metaphor slightly edges toward abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but one or two figurative phrases flirt with purple prose, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences multitask (e.g., “knuckles white where she gripped the railing of solidified cloud-stone” conveys emotion, setting, and material). Figurative language is pattern-taught (cloud sea tides, brittle awakenings) and paid off. Minor scaffold in “profound, effortless coexistence” borders on abstraction but is immediately grounded by sensory detail. No loops, no purple prose; final line crystallizes motif without redundancy. Read-aloud rhythm is masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (e.g., “damp weight cool in her palm” conveys touch, emotion, and object significance). Figurative language is purposeful (“prismatic quiet,” “living mosaic”) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “tangible loom where the action of rejoin could unfold”—slightly abstract amid concrete prose—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, synonym churn, or template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“jagged scar of malice,” “flowers after drought”) and varies rhythm effectively. Minor overwriting appears in the final third: “cartographer of hope mapping light against the void” risks abstraction, and “ethereal grit” is labeled rather than fully dramatized. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the phrase “cautiously hopeful” repeats verbatim, creating a slight motif redundancy. Information density remains high, with nearly every sentence advancing plot, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “writhed like serpents” conveys rejection + visual + tactile. Minor overwriting in “spatial mutiny raged—stones groaned, archways shuddered” (two near-synonymous verbs). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One mixed metaphor: “tightening like a fist around her ribs” clashes slightly with later “resonant chord” motif, but not severely. Propulsion remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: “mist clung to limestone cliffs like breath held too long” establishes atmosphere, character (attuned to restraint), and foreshadowing. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances plot or deepens theme. Figurative language is coherent—water, stone, silk motifs interweave without contradiction. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in one passage, but never obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “bruised” sky, “salt-stained lamp,” “monstrous wave gather” do triple duty (atmosphere, character, plot). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with tension (short bursts during evacuation). One minor artifact: “spongey dread” appears twice with identical phrasing, risking a loop, but it’s purposeful—a refrain anchoring the tone. No filter-verb stacks; embodiment is precise (“breath caught,” “heart hammering against the copper nail”). Final line’s “hand that no longer trembled” recharges the opening’s anxiety without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“undisturbed dust motes dancing in sunbeams, the absence of footprints, the lingering scent of ozone and old paper”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (pixelation, fragmentation, weaving) and coheres without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-text (“shimmering, pixelated mosaic”; “luminous thread of connection”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors musical cadence, closing with resonant simplicity: “a compass of hope.”

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose has high information density: “dust motes dancing like forgotten memories” merges atmosphere, theme, and POV. Minor overwriting in “meticulously preserved collection” slightly dulls immediacy, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Final line recharges opening dusk imagery without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (e.g., “air hummed with quiet machinery and carried the scent of aged paper and polished brass” establishes setting, mood, and profession). Rhythm varies naturally, with paragraph lengths mirroring emotional cadence. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (stars as breaths, daylily as emblem of transience). Minor deduction for slight overuse of figurative language in the final paragraph (“shared burden now a shared light”), though it serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically (e.g., fragmented urgency vs. lyrical flow), and every line advances character or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent—thorns symbolize both armor and truth-piercing without contradiction. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“storm of sorrow,” “malevolent grace”) slightly dilutes clarity but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero loops or scaffold; information density high (e.g., “obsidian” seed conveys coolness, sharpness, and paradox in one word).

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“sky bleeding violet,” “whisper thin as spider-silk”), but avoids overwriting—each metaphor serves pressure or closure. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional intensity. One paraphrase loop: “anxious elation” appears three times, slightly dulling its impact. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; high information density maintained even in reflective beats anchored by concrete cues (oak’s bark, clipping’s glow).

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme without redundancy. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (e.g., “silver veins bloomed through the char like healing scars”). Minor overwriting in one beat (“fiercely gentle net of authentic remorse”) slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors the earned peace—rhythm breathes where earlier lines pulsed with tension.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful detail (“frayed and stained with decades of smoke, sweat, and memory”), but minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “tidal wave of shame,” “ghost of today’s public failure” verge on cliché. Sentence openings vary well, though two adjacent lines use “He...” constructions (“He closed his eyes... He let the memory flow”). No loops or scaffold, but one register drift (“profound satisfaction”) slightly jars the roadie’s voice. Closure beat remains clear despite these hairline slips.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “luminescent energy along the arbor’s conductive branches” merges setting and action; “haunted ambition” avoids therapy-speak by grounding it in trembling hands and worn wool. Minor redundancy in “residual warmth, the exact second the light vanished” slightly dilutes momentum, but rhythm varies effectively—long descriptive passages yield to staccato beats at climax (“He knelt.” “Aris smiled.”). Figurative language is coherent: magnetic fields as wind, grief as unspooled thread. Final line’s “promise taking root in touching distance” perfectly echoes the title motif without overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense with purpose: every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent (tide/time/wonder motifs) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “shimmering contradictions” slightly dilutes propulsion, but rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops, scaffold, or register drift—clarity remains intact even in peak lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional figurative stacking (“light lived not as invasion but as inherent truth within the stone”) edges toward overwriting in low-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the phrase “resonant hush” recurs three times with diminishing returns. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support emotional cadence, yet one mixed metaphor—“vault door within his chest swing open”—slightly jars the physical logic established by bunker terminology.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield: “ivy whispered against her sleeves” conveys sound, texture, movement, and mood. Figurative language is consistent—hydrological and musical metaphors never clash—and peaks cleanly at closure. Minor artifact: slight overuse of em-dashes in mid-section (e.g., “—map references marking…”), creating faint syntactic monotony, but not enough to obscure causality or dull the final image. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly echoes river current—fluid, cumulative, resolving without flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, setting, or theme. Syntax varies effectively, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop weakens momentum: “propagation delays” appears three times in close proximity with minimal variation. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “symphony of human experience” risks generic uplift. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (“perforated destiny converged into this singular, propagating moment”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (ice = fragility, velvet = absorption) and pays off without muddle. Minor overwriting in the coffee-stain paragraph (“intricate, prophetic maps”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final lines (“fertile ground”) land with earned resonance, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (“sky congealed into ancient stone,” “silence so profound it seemed to glow”). Figurative language is consistent—celestial, textile, and mineral motifs interweave without contradiction. Minor overwriting appears in “radiant hush” repeated thrice, slightly diluting its charge, but never obscures causality. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves with earned weight, though “keeper of thresholds” edges toward label—but is immediately grounded by concrete action (“descending the crystalline steps”).

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but mostly controlled; figurative language serves theme (“clouds drifted like forgotten dreams,” “liquid metronome”). However, density occasionally tips into overwriting: “vineyard hush so profound it felt like the earth itself was holding its breath” borders on strained metaphor. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“release the final shards… as an act of profound self-care” echoes earlier forgiveness). Still, rhythm varies, propulsion holds, and the final lines achieve clarity and grace without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence openings and strong verbs (“surrendering,” “cracked,” “billowed”). Minor overwriting in “hollow mirror shard, salvaged from the *Starling*’s wreck”—the italics feel slightly ornamental. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or character. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “magnetic stones humming a low farewell” merges setting and emotion. Figurative language is coherent (ripples = temporal layers; sycamore seed = spiral of insight) without purple excess. Minor redundancy in “fading memory… receded into fog” slightly dulls momentum, but line-level propulsion remains strong. Final paragraph’s cadence—“ready to carry this truth into the waiting dawn”—resolves with rhythmic precision and recharged motif.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or resonance logic. Figurative language is consistent (“libraries” of bone, “living river” of birds) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching the flock’s movements. Minor overwriting in “whispers layered through centuries of dust that settled like forgotten prayers” slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull the closure. Information density remains high even in lyric passages.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and theme (“ink-stained fingers traced a fading sigil”). Figurative language is coherent: “brilliant dimness” recurs as tonal anchor without muddle. Minor artifact: “unstrapped” slightly overused in climax (three instances in four lines), risking scaffold, but meaning evolves (shame → expectations → solitude). No loops or purple prose; rhythm varies naturally, especially in descent (“fog carried jasmine’s ghost”).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors, no purple excess. Minor artifact: slight overuse of “luminous” variants in final third, but not enough to obscure closure. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence, and the final line (“no longer hiding, but shining”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is masterful: high information density (“amber-encased railing of the observatory deck, feeling the trapped warmth of a sun extinguished millennia ago”), varied sentence openings, and strategic repetition (“backwards prophecy” refrains). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image advances atmosphere or character. One minor flaw: “violent static bursts crackling from the console—a chaotic echo…” slightly overloads modifiers, but clarity holds. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors “steady hum.”

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density—nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot—but occasionally leans into figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., “swirling vortex of nameless fear” followed closely by “formless echoes”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though the phrase “echo of sacrifice” borders on thematic echo near the end. Rhythm varies effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the Kraken description, but closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “fracturing dawn’s first light into liquid gemstones” does atmospheric, thematic, and character work. Sentence openings vary (“Elara stood…”, “Her motivation…”, “She had documented…”), and paragraph cuts heighten rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats—“physics of faith waiting only for attention to manifest” edges toward abstraction—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; information density remains high without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language (“shadows pooled thick,” “violet bleed of dusk”) is vivid but not overwhelming, and metaphors remain coherent (memory as “foundation,” silence as “sacred space”). Minor overwriting appears in “poignant perfume of return” and “ghostly streets,” but these don’t obscure causality. The final paragraph’s cadence—“one rescued artifact, one remembered moment at a time”—propels momentum while echoing the story’s accumulative structure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter mar the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “frozen dew crystal, harvested at dawn’s first breath” does triple duty (object, time, ritual). Minor overwriting in “kaleidoscopic waterfall that veiled this hidden sanctuary”—“veiled” slightly redundant after “hidden.” No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively. Figurative language is coherent (fire as “river of light,” flock as “living inkblot”) and never muddles causality. Final paragraph’s “permanent resident in her harmonized heart” risks slight abstraction but is anchored by the warm river stone.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “starlight fractured through an ice-laden vine onto the obsidian floor” conveys setting, action, and thematic fracture in one image. Sentence openings vary (“Elara exhaled,” “Ancient silverwood vines,” “Her fingers found”), and paragraph lengths breathe with emotional rhythm. Minor overwriting in “frigid air as she scanned the star-dusted velvet sky” leans purple, but figurative language pays off in closure (vines “glowing softly”). No loops or scaffold; every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully, with paragraph lengths mirroring emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“neural pathways ignited like constellations birthing light”) edges toward figurative density without muddle. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; however, “numbness” and “void” recur with slight synonym churn, preventing 9+ line-level perfection. Closure beat remains sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong information density—most lines advance character, theme, and atmosphere simultaneously. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “orthogonal approaches: not asking *what* the seed was, but *why* it had come to him” leans slightly abstract for peak insight. No loops or scaffold, but one instance of near-paraphrase (“safeguard space for innovation” appears twice) prevents 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“silence pressed against the walls like a physical weight”) and varied rhythm. Occasional overwriting—“mournfully eager grace,” “fractured and tender”—edges toward mannerism but serves voice. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or pressure. Final paragraph’s cadence (“star-dusted night… find its way home again”) lands with earned resonance, though “whispered promise” slightly risks abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (“tapestry of shredded parchment skin, ink-stained claws”). Figurative language is coherent (light “dances” with darkness; homesickness “echoes”) and peaks without muddle. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in opening paragraph (“mist curled like smoke from a dying candle” borders on ornamental), but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“exactly where it was meant to be”) resonates without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“soot-stained fingers cradled the broken bishop’s crozier… a cold testament to seventy-three failed attempts”), but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“whisper of potential others dismissed as silence” borders on abstraction). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “frozen bloom” repeats with evolving meaning. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line (“guided by light she forged from fracture”) perfectly recharges the opening motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “shard of hush, solidified silence fallen from the void between creation and oblivion”). Figurative language is consistent—no mixed metaphors—and serves theme. Minor overwriting in “serenely electric potential” slightly strains, but rhythm remains varied. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, setting, or idea. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors earned stillness without slackening momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “railing flickered—revealing the dark water beneath for a heartbeat” conveys anomaly, duration, and visual rupture in one clause. Figurative language is purposeful (“shattered” reflection, “liquid mercury” patterns) without muddle. Minor flaw: slight overwriting in “resonant reconfiguration” phrasing near climax, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence modulates perfectly—short declaratives (“He stepped onto the pier”) anchor the return to mundane, contrasting earlier lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“sunlight fractured through crystalline apertures,” “river of flowing time”), but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “vivid memories burst forth… now unleashed with raw clarity” edges toward abstraction. Minor scaffold in “not with fire, but with essence” slightly dulls immediacy. Otherwise, sentence variety, strong verbs, and sensory specificity maintain propulsion, though one paraphrase loop exists between “rational enchantment shattered” and “boundary dissolved.”

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“pulsed,” “unfolded,” “ignited”) and varied sentence structure. Information density is high: “pitted iron of the boat anchor chain link” conveys history, texture, and function in one phrase. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“somber marvel—grief and wonder fused into purpose”) edges toward label-speak, but is redeemed by immediate dramatization (Lyra’s hand on the link). No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or concept.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “faint glint betraying the hearing aid” does triple duty (image, character, plot). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“frozen rivers,” “spider silk”) and paid off in closure’s “pearlescent light.” Minor artifact: “profound reeling hush” slightly overloads modifiers, but “reeling” earns its place by echoing later disorientation. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line’s “vital stitch” metaphor crystallizes theme without purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “concrete throat,” “serpent of claustrophobia,” “frost bloomed in fractal patterns” all serve atmosphere and pressure. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“alchemical marvel did not merely glitter…”) slightly slows momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports rhythm; paragraph cuts heighten tension. Final lines avoid redundancy, landing with salt-spray poignancy.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “iron-gall ink bloomed like a neural map” does triple duty (image, action, metaphor). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional rhythm. One minor flaw: “wisdom crystallized not as blame, but as clarity” edges toward abstraction, though quickly grounded by the shard-as-key image. No loops, scaffold, or register drift—every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “fossilized spines of leviathans thrust skyward like skeletal cathedrals” conveys scale, history, and atmosphere in one image. Sentence openings vary (“She stood…”, “For sixty dawns…”, “Entering the tunnel…”); paragraph lengths shift with action. No loops or scaffold—each line advances plot, character, or setting. Figurative language is coherent (diamond flaws = bird patterns = linguistic textures), though the phrase “quietly articulate” borders on label-like; minor deduction for near-repetition in lines 41 and 161.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density (“cathedral of roots and resilience,” “static-laden confessions”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (gravity, frost, static) and pays off in the dewdrop pirouette and thawing hope. Minor scaffold in “bitterness—the sharp, flint-hard certainty” slightly over-explains, but no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Final line (“The frost around her hope began, slowly, to thaw”) recharges the flint/frost motif with propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“resonantly soft” recurs with evolving weight) and payoff-integrated. Minor redundancy in “tarnished wonder” reprise, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Closure beat (“vulnerable signal of a single, beating heart”) avoids purple prose; clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “drank the twilight,” “thunderstorm in a bottle,” “brittle hush” all do double duty. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“violet lightning flashed, mist fell, energy crackled”) edges toward stacked modifiers, slightly muddling immediacy. No loops or scaffolds; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image remains sharp despite slight figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“pearlescent veil,” “whispering gleam” recurs with slight redundancy). Sentence openings vary, and rhythm supports emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop exists: “misting hush” described twice with near-identical phrasing. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks, but the phrase “whispering gleam” borders on motif overuse in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery: “sonnets calculated orbital trajectories,” “tessellations of curved triangles stretching toward infinity.” Sentences vary rhythmically, avoiding monotony, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“hyperbolic pathways with her mind”) slightly dilutes immediacy, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final line (“mapped by love’s infinite geometry”) recharges the core metaphor without redundancy. High information density; nearly every phrase advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor overwriting in “woven threads of old lullabies into the salt-laced breeze” slightly dilutes immediacy, but figurative language remains coherent. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful (e.g., darkroom revelation). Final line’s “new story began to whisper” risks slight echo, but it’s earned by the archipelago’s established voice. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively, avoiding syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with imagery but avoids overwriting; each sentence advances atmosphere or action. Figurative language is coherent (hair as “filament of captured starlight,” fear’s “rigid architecture”). Minor redundancy in “whispering” motifs (oaks, silk, unsent letters), but no paraphrase loops. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors the locksmith’s quiet exit—propulsive yet hushed. One near-miss: “cosmic possibility” borders on vague abstraction but is grounded by context.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density (e.g., “Orion’s belt was fractured by the Aurora’s mast” conveys setting, action, and theme). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in the opening paragraph (“salt-bleached mud with a soft sigh” + “deliberate act against thirty-two years” risks stacked modifiers), but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. The closure beat is clean, though “profound release and understanding” edges toward label—but is immediately grounded in physical action (tears tracing grime).

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme—but risks slight overwriting in peak beats (“blade sheathed in velvet,” “fossil of potential”). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is pattern-taught (geometry motif) and payoff-earned (spiral = return). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: short staccato during tension (“She dipped the quill”), lyrical during reflection. Minor deduction for two adjacent metaphor-dense lines in Kael’s explanation that border on purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density: “liquid silver mist,” “gnarled hands, wise from seventy seasons.” Minor overwriting appears in peak beats—e.g., “tapestry woven from pure chromatic emotion” borders on abstract—but is grounded immediately by concrete threads (pink blossom, azure sky). No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. One slight redundancy: “radiant hush” used twice, but the second instance reweights it as triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density: “interlaced hush” conveys both concept and atmosphere in three words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (silence as frost, peace as tapestry) and never muddled in peak beats. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “profound quiet began to accumulate... thickening like settling frost”—two metaphors for one idea—but this doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with action, and the final line (“her own unrest finally soothed”) resolves with clean, charged simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rain had wept down the vaulted ceiling, blurring saints and constellations into watercolor memories” does setting, mood, and theme in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (erosion as language, silence as vessel). Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in mid-text, but no artifact dulls the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “frayed by salt yet serene” compresses character and theme. Minor scaffold in “by untangling threads” repetition (lines 94/168), but no paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is coherent (snow globe = microcosm), though “frozen stars awaiting command” slightly strains physical logic. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors settling particles—varied sentence lengths create breath without drag.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“etched,” “swirled,” “cradled”) and controlled figurative language. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “alchemy of sorrow into symbol,” “silent symphony weaving through the city’s bones” verge on abstraction. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent sentences near the climax (“She carved a rising bird… a teardrop cradled…”) list symbols without escalating pressure. Still, information density is high, and the final paragraph’s cadence resolves with earned quietude.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is restrained and coherent—light “fracturing,” symbols “softening and realigning like stars”—all tied to the central motif. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the elevator’s ascent. One minor flaw: slight overuse of semicolons and em-dashes in mid-story could tighten, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. The final paragraph’s cadence resolves with grace, and the closing line recharges the “scattered light” motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere (“ink a dark tear” conveys grief, action, and sensory detail). Figurative language is pattern-taught (cloud-emotions) and payoff-earned (void as smile). Minor overwriting in “quietly explosive” repetition (twice), but no loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies purposefully: cadence slows for reflection (“spooled wholeness”), accelerates for crisis (“turbulence rocked the basket”). Final line’s “remembered not in stone, but in sky” recharges the core motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “dust motes drifted like forgotten stars” merges image, mood, and theme. Figurative language is coherent (sky metaphors evolve from canvas to coin) and never muddles clarity. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. One minor slip: “crafted beauty” slightly borders on abstraction, but it’s grounded immediately by “sentenced to dust.” No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (light as both literal lamp and metaphorical promise) and avoids purple excess. Minor scaffold appears in “diligently curious by nature” (label-like), and slight synonym churn in “whispers,” “echoes,” “murmurations”—but these don’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“sailed toward dawn… story continuing”) earns its lyricism without loop or drift.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density: “brass cogs worn smooth by decades of devotion” conveys history, texture, and emotion in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent—light fractures, nostalgia drifts, ice sighs—all grounded in physical logic. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (“blood-tinged moons and whispered promises”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but peak beats remain clear. No loops, no scaffold; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. Final line (“bright as a mended sky”) perfectly recharges the eclipse-lock premise.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “spiraling apple trees that bore fruit in impossible hues” establishes setting, tone, and wonder in one phrase. Figurative language is consistent (botanical/cosmic lexicon) and avoids muddle. Minor scaffold in “They had been strangers mere cycles ago…” could tighten, but no loops or register drift mar peak beats. Final paragraph’s cadence (“every tended branch, every shared glance…”) echoes opening without redundancy, closing the textual circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (fractals, spirals, hush) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“bruised awe flooded her chest”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Final lines achieve luminous clarity without muddle. One near-redundancy (“nested patterns dissolved into starlight, the lullaby now woven…”) costs 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense, varied, and propulsive. Sentences multitask: “mechanical birds of tarnished brass and iron patrolled… their clockwork wings ticking like metronomes counting down the daylight” establishes setting, time pressure, and tone in one breath. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is precise (“twilight bled into violet,” “graceless beauty”) and never muddles causality. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors the birds’ ticking—quiet, steady, resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but largely purposeful; metaphors cohere (braided streams = relational paths, chrysalis = transformation). Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“suffocating storm,” “reflective ache”), and one paraphrase loop exists (“divergent path... separation into connection” restated across paragraphs). However, rhythm varies effectively, sentences do multiple jobs, and closure imagery (“foam patterns... vanished downstream”) remains clear and potent. No artifacts dull the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (void as “cool, absolute,” silence as “data”), though near-peak beats risk slight overwriting (“swirling sea of clouds that churned like liquid marble”). No loops or scaffold; momentum builds cleanly to the incision. Final lines avoid redundancy, using prismatic showers and stilled clouds to echo and resolve earlier motifs without paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—each metaphor serves character or theme (e.g., “sandpaper rough memories,” “sorrow flooded his spirit like spilled ink”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting appears in the climax (“metallic void of broken trust,” “umami of hard-won wisdom”), where figurative density slightly risks muddle, but coherence holds. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. The final tear tracing the coral archway resolves the opening’s mirror motif with perfect economy.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“Her fingers… brushed the cold brass… with reverent precision” conveys character, action, and tone). Rhythm shifts with scene needs: cadence slows for ritual, accelerates for restoration. Minor overwriting in peak beats—“vigorous tender chaos” risks abstraction, and “symphony of connection” borders on thematic echo. No loops or scaffold, but one register drift: “resilient tapestry” leans toward decorative metaphor. Still, line-level craft remains high, with concrete verbs and sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic variation. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the climax (“torrent,” “double helix of shared humanity,” “ethereal light”), risking overwriting. One paraphrase loop: “profound transformation” appears twice in close proximity with minimal added pressure. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, but the density in mid-story slightly dulls propulsion. Still, line-level craft remains strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density (“stalactites now rose from the ‘floor’ above”) and varied syntax that propels momentum. Figurative language is coherent (light as “liquid stars,” mist as “spectral shroud”) without muddle. Minor artifact: slight overuse of “luminous” variants in climactic beat, but pattern is taught early and pays off. No loops, scaffold, or redundancy; every sentence earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“stress cracks mapped its surface like a sorrowful score”) but avoids overwriting—figurative language appears in <30% of sentences, concentrated in reflective beats. Sentence openings vary (“Dawn…”, “The last stars…”, “This precise moment…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor flaw: “empathy in motion was her creed” edges toward label-speak, though immediately grounded in action (“active translation of pain into connection”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure beat remains artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “sky bleeding twilight hues” does atmospheric and emotional work. Sentence variety avoids monotony; paragraph cuts serve rhythm (e.g., one-line “Tears welled...” after stillness). Minor overwriting in “crystalline chime of cooling stone”—slightly ornamental—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; every image ties to theme (dent = devotion, stars = strategy). Final line (“Beauty lived in the difficult turn...”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“sky dusted with cold, watchful stars,” “love turned to stone”) and avoids paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm varies skillfully, accelerating during resonator tuning, then slowing into the calm after recovery. One minor flaw: the phrase “theaterical sincerity that was never performance but profound conviction” edges toward abstract labeling, though it’s quickly grounded in her whispered vow. Otherwise, every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes with zero fat.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented (“olfactorily sensitive nature,” “metabolic sigh”), risking density over clarity in high-pressure beats. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, minor scaffold appears in cumulative word counts (non-textual but distracting) and slight synonym churn (“serenity,” “peace,” “stillness”) in adjacent lines. No fatal artifacts, but enough to prevent 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“water… streamed upward in luminous ribbons—a living map only visible now” advances setting, plot, and theme). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “visual symphony of leaves spiraling upward” edges toward purple, but pattern-taught lyricism pays off in closure. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve momentum. One paraphrase-loop risk (“resilience was born from remembrance, tended by reverence” / “true resilience flows… from listening”) but thematic necessity justifies near-redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield (“morning light diffused into hazy precision by coastal mist clinging to steel walls”). Figurative language is disciplined: metaphors serve concept (wind “singing the metal to failure”) without muddle. Minor artifact: slight overuse of participle phrases (“unslung… withdrawing… noting”) in early paragraph, but not enough to dull closure. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors mapped wind—sharp, clear, purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“cathedral of frozen time,” “shard of crystalline cerulean blue”) and high information density—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Minor overwriting appears in early paragraphs (“meticulously shaped… sculpted hush”), but peak beats avoid figurative muddle. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops or scaffold, though one near-paraphrase (“sculpted hush” repeated) slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is luminous but occasionally over-embroidered: “avalanchingly quiet” appears three times, risking redundancy; “cosmic weave fractured under rigid command” edges toward abstraction. Yet high-pressure beats avoid therapy-speak—insight arrives through sensory immersion (stone dissolving, air shimmering). Sentence variety propels rhythm: long lyrical strands for ritual, short gasps for epiphany (“Failure was not incompetence…”). One paraphrase loop: “harvest insights from failure” / “harvest its bitter lesson” slightly dilutes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “clack of type was a heartbeat” merges sound, action, and metaphor. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional rhythm. One minor flaw: “visceral resonance where another’s grief became her hollow chest” borders on label-speak but is immediately grounded in physicality (“fractured breath,” “weary posture”). No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; figurative language is consistent (light, sound, texture) and never muddled in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths modulate breath. Minor overwriting in “celestial fire painting the world in living jade and amethyst”—slightly ornamental—but redeemed by immediate grounding in Kael’s boots on stone. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; the prose propels without padding. Final image (“new star rooted firmly in the earth”) earns its lyricism through prior concrete buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “frost melted into droplets, each a tiny prism reflecting his transformed perspective” does triple duty. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—short clauses during focus (“He traced chaotic lines”), flowing cadences during realization. Minor artifact: slight overuse of em-dashes in mid-story (e.g., “a gentle intention woven into routine care—In that instant…”), but no loops or scaffold. Figurative language remains coherent (light/frost/prism motif never muddles), though “truthful lies” borders on label-speak—saved by immediate contextual grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density: “raveling silence” conveys concept, stakes, and sensory decay in three words. Sentence openings vary (“Deep within…”, “Elara…”, “Her great loom…”), and paragraph lengths mirror emotional rhythm. Minor overwriting in “water-stained box filled not with treasure, but with jigsaw puzzle edges” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors dull closure. Final image (“tiny leaves catching the sun with a stoic sparkle”) pays off earlier motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “threads swirling like liquid starlight” conveys magic, motion, and texture). Minor scaffold appears in cumulative word counts (artifact of prompt), but they don’t obscure causality. One slight redundancy: “quietly determined resolve” and “quiet determination” echo unnecessarily. Otherwise, figurative language is coherent, syntax varied, and closure image (“dew-kissed apple blossom”) crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “engineers shouting, starship engines roaring” conveys vibrancy in six words. Figurative language is purposeful (“skeletal ships drifted like forgotten prayers”) and coherent. Minor scaffold in “mapping dissonance, seeking the thread” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no paraphrase loops or register drift. Final line (“more like a sanctuary”) recharges the opening’s desolation with earned resonance, avoiding purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. One minor overwriting risk—“spectral rainbows that danced like forgotten promises”—edges toward mixed metaphor but is redeemed by immediate grounding in “curved walls.” No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; information density is high without sacrificing clarity, especially in the pivotal stacking sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“emerald lighthouse drank the starlight,” “waves unclenched their white fists”) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“glass wick warming like a living pulse”) edges toward purple but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with scene rhythm. Final line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“Time softened like steeping tea…” ties sensation, metaphor, and pacing). Minor overwriting appears in mid-section (“liquid-gold path advancing inch by deliberate inch”)—slightly redundant rhythm—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; figurative language coheres around light/refraction motifs. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with abstract phrasing (“fragile architecture of connection”), costing full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “quantified sorrow” does thematic and atmospheric work; “liquid silver” moonlight advances both image and plot. Sentence openings vary (“Rain lashed…”, “Her motivation…”, “Now, as the storm…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor overwriting in “ephemeral fragments clinging to leaves and stones—whispers of joy, echoes of regret, fragments of forgotten melodies” borders on stacked modifiers, but payoff justifies it. No loops or scaffold; closure image (“moonlight humming its quiet promise”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “moss threaded with silver spider-silk” conveys texture, ritual, and fragility in one phrase. Figurative language is pattern-taught (loom, weaving, threads) and pays off in closure without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-text (“luminous threads—gold from courage, rose from compassion, amber from resilience”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull the climax. Final lines resonate with earned simplicity: “a tomorrow written in light.”

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “Moonlight bled” establishes tone; “shelves leaning inward like guardians” avoids mixed metaphor. Minor overwriting in “enlarged tranquility” (used thrice) borders on label-speak but is redeemed by contextual embodiment (candle flame, fluid movements). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line (“every book... felt like a friend returned home”) resonates without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is controlled—“guerrilla gardening,” “steam like a blessing”—without muddle. Minor scaffold in “tenuous absolution” repeated, but payoff justifies it. No loops or register drift; final paragraph’s “ordinary held its sacred breath” resonates without purple prose. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, supporting emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light = memory, frequency = emotion) and pays off in the closure. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “ten thousand other vows pulsed in quiet communion,” which edges toward abstraction, but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe, and the final lines (“For as long as light lingered…”) echo with rhythmic inevitability. No loops, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose density is exceptional: “brass worn smooth by generations” conveys history, tactility, and inheritance in six words. Sentence rhythm accelerates during interventions (“shatter and gasp scattering his audience”) then breathes at dawn (“traders packed with quiet ritual”). One minor artifact: “comforting unease” repeats verbatim (lines 30/250/309), slightly dulling its payoff. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors—even high-pressure beats avoid purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or concept. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (aurora as “silent rivers,” ring as “bridge between dirt and starlight”). Minor overwriting in cumulative descriptors (“jade and violet,” “crushed lavender, and the sweet honey”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence beautifully modulates closure without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density: “charcoal-fingered hands” conveys profession, history, and physicality in three words. Figurative language is purposeful—“silence heavier than granite,” “phantom limb” of art—but avoids muddle. Minor artifact: slight overuse of “glow” variants in climax (auroral, ethereal, luminous), though justified by the crystal motif. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, from staccato (“She began to sketch”) to flowing clauses mirroring artistic motion. Final line (“creativity... flowed like light through crystal”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each line multitasks (e.g., “gilded leaf trembling as a merchant’s lie echoed” fuses setting, character, conflict). Figurative language is coherent: wilting vines, poisoned sky, and gold leaf recur with evolving meaning. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Minor overwriting in “night-blooming cereus” risks purple prose, but it’s earned by the bloom motif. Final brushstroke image pays off the opening with perfect cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “glisten with fierce inner radiance” does triple duty (sight, emotion, theme). Figurative language is coherent—light “paints,” bells “weave tapestry”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in “muted vigor—a strength potent yet restrained, like a deep river current” slightly dilutes immediacy. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line (“wonder not only endured but quietly flourished”) resolves with resonant simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “plastic spider softened, twisted, and vanished in a wisp of smoke no larger than a breath” compresses transformation, scale, and control in one image. Minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in the ritual sequence (“miniature vortex,” “molten gold”) edges toward density overload, though pattern is taught early. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“Inside…”, “Then…”, “It glided…”). Final line’s triple anaphora (“A keeper… A keeper… A being…”) earns its lyricism through accumulated weight.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “sandstorm calm” conveys stillness amid emotion; “rust-streaked iron box bolted to the courtyard pillar” merges setting and history. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—no mixed metaphors or purple excess. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during revelation (“Her breath stilled”), then breathing into resolution. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (web, loom, dance) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in “spider spins its web” and “ancient pulse” slightly dilutes propulsion, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. Final line—“a silent poem of resilience, written in motion and light”—resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“gleaming silence,” “gravity swirled like a silent storm”) and pays off in closure. Minor scaffold in “pressed wildflowers of lavender and chickweed—a brittle anchor” slightly over-clarifies, but no loops or synonym churn. Final paragraph’s cadence (“steady golden path… calm and sure”) earns its resonance without purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but disciplined, with high information density: “the space between a cricket’s chirp and the next was a valley” does setting, character, and theme work. Minor overwriting appears in mid-text (“slithering through village dreams, twisting hope into dread”), where figurative density slightly slows momentum. No loops or scaffold, but one near-paraphrase: “silence so pure and complete it felt like a physical balm” echoes earlier “textured landscape” concept. Final third remains clean, preserving closure integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “steam curling into the cool night air as meteors scratched ephemeral lines” merges atmosphere and action. Figurative language is consistent (architecture as language) without muddle. Minor redundancy in “patiently nimble” repetition (three times), but not adjacent—functions as motif. Final paragraph’s “soft punctuation” and “woven into Elara’s own” avoid summarization, closing with concrete, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information yield per line (e.g., “moss beneath her knees felt like crushed velvet, soft and silent” merges texture, sound, and emotional tone). Figurative language is coherent—light weaves, memories seed, resolve is spider silk—without muddle. Minor overwriting in “supernova of love and loss” risks purple prose, but it’s anchored by immediate context. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with rhythm, and the final line (“found her own light”) recharges the dawn motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “stalactites hung like frozen tears” merges image, mood, and motif. Minor overwriting in “wisely enduring the weight of calibrated treason” edges toward label-speak, but it’s immediately grounded in trembling hands. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies purposefully. Final paragraph’s cadence (“light as the aurora’s breath”) earns its lyricism through prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “stone ribs coiled beneath a tapestry of cold, watchful stars” merges setting, mood, and metaphor economically. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“tapestry of love, greed, and regret” borders on label-speak), and “reed-blown melancholy” recurs slightly mechanically. Otherwise, rhythm accelerates with tension, paragraphs vary visually, and every line advances atmosphere or plot. No loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “slumped like a frozen tear,” “liquid gold across names etched in ice.” Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“gentle current of Lena’s subconscious, a realm of softened edges and whispered echoes”) slightly blurs immediacy, but no loops or scaffold. Closure image (“tiny, perfect rainbow”) remains crystalline—no artifact dulls it.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting risks clarity: “scintillatingly somber” appears twice with minimal variation, and “hidden patterns” verges on thematic repetition. Yet rhythm remains fluid, sentence openings vary, and paragraphs modulate visual pacing. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. The only flaw: “demure audacity” borders on label-speak, though it’s redeemed by contextual embodiment in the whistle and final walk.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “mechanical hiss a stark contrast to the radioactive tempest screaming” establishes tone, conflict, and setting in one breath. Figurative language is precise and consistent—no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “comfortable lies societies clung to for solace” slightly abstracts, but otherwise momentum never stalls. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors resolve: light footsteps, heavy secret.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “lightning flash-lit the churning cloud ocean,” “grit of whimsy lived in this truth.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (shadows as carriers of meaning) and never muddles causality. Minor overwriting in “river of metaphor and memory flowing against the wind’s howl” slightly dilutes urgency, but rhythm varies effectively—staccato during static, lyrical in prophecy. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line (“map for tomorrow”) recharges the cobalt portico motif with earned resonance, closing the textural arc cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with high information density (“sky bled from indigo to pearl,” “brass key tarnished green with time and tears”). However, two adjacent sentences summarize the same emotional state (“sorrow for loss and hope for reconnection” / “wound he now sought to heal”), creating a paraphrase loop. Figurative language is dense but coherent, though “sound-wings” verges on mixed metaphor. Final paragraph’s “promise” line is slightly abstract compared to earlier concreteness, dulling closure momentum by 0.3–0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density (“azure-coat,” “fleshly ethereal,” “star-iron key” all do multiple jobs). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “molten amber and rose,” “crystalline clarity pulling starlight from shadow” approach purple prose but remain legible due to consistent voice. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors earned stillness, though one or two stacked modifiers slightly blur propulsion in the sunset description.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely artifact-free, with high information-per-line (e.g., “hexagonal columns… absorbing the day’s last light while guarding the profound stillness”). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“internal forge was her motivation…”) edges toward abstraction but recovers before closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Closure beat (“tendril of vibrant emerald moss… quiet promise”) is clear, resonant, and uncluttered—though one adjacent line (“defiant whisper of life”) slightly strains metaphor without muddying meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful: “splashed through shallow streams” establishes setting, mood, and causality in one stroke. Sentences vary rhythmically, with paragraph cuts serving emotional beats (e.g., after “crushing weight of obligation”). Minor flaw: “entangled memories reverberated through her—not hallucinations, but empathetic imprints” uses explanatory dash where dramatization might suffice. No loops or scaffold, but one near-redundancy in describing the lantern’s etching twice.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “dust motes drifted like silent prayers” establishes tone economically. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light, silence, ticking) and pays off in the golden shaft climax. Minor scaffold in “aptly deliberate grace” and “aptly deliberate care” (repetition across 111/217) triggers −0.3 loop penalty. Otherwise high information density, varied syntax, and concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, each sentence advancing character, setting, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (e.g., “stubborn flea on a furious green beast”) and pays off in the sea’s mirror-like stillness. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; even lush descriptions (“diamond cascade,” “crimson spiral”) serve tactical function. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the middle—two adjacent lines echo “fractured” imagery—but clarity at closure remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “navy fabric frayed, silver comet tarnished”). Minor scaffold in “her deeper motivation burned quietly” edges toward label, but quickly grounded in action. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony; paragraph lengths vary purposefully. Final line resonates without overwriting—“sacred space between them” earns its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“shadow-laced,” “threads of indigo”) and pays off in closure (shadow now green/gold). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “splinters of a future that had shattered decades ago” slightly abstract, but quickly grounded in tactile action. No loops, scaffold, or simultaneity errors; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line (“bloomed defiantly above the now-serene ice floes”) perfectly recharges opening imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density—nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“Elara awoke…”, “Her hands…”, “Tucked in…”) and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “windborne solace that felt like absolution” edges toward abstraction, and “resonance woven from love, memory, and stubborn continuity” risks stacked modifiers. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines (“The fold in her patience had become a cradle…”) slightly paraphrase the patience motif. Closure remains unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density: “roots seeking water,” “gnarled Cabernet rootstock embraced a delicate Viognier graft.” Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “mismatched roots teaching resilience” echoes earlier graft description without new pressure. Figurative density is high in peak beats but pattern-taught (vine imagery established early) and paid off at closure. Final line avoids scaffold, recharging the pavilion’s glow with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is vivid, varied, and purposeful, with high information density—e.g., “porcelain half-mask, cool against his left cheek, symbolized…” conveys object, sensation, and creed in one beat. Minor overwriting appears in mid-text (“subterranean heartbeat syncing with his own breath”), but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph avoids moralizing, trusting image: “stars emerged, witnesses to the preserved echo’s gentle vigil.” One slight redundancy: “murmuring pavilion” repeats without deepening, but doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but mostly controlled; figurative language serves theme (“vines climbed higher, embracing the ruins with gentle strength”). Occasional density—e.g., “alchemically transmute the town’s collective pain”—edges toward elevated diction, but remains voice-consistent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and structure. Final paragraph’s firefly arcs echo earlier motifs cleanly. Minor overwriting in “resilient communal tapestry” slightly dulls momentum, but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line payoff (e.g., “tears traced clean paths through dust”). Figurative language is coherent—crystal as “teardrop,” chandelier as “constellation”—and avoids muddle. Minor scaffold in lines 110–117 (“His method centered… sacred phenomenon”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops or artifacts touch closure. Sentence openings and paragraph lengths vary purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“mist coalescing into fleeting forms—a weeping willow, a child’s outstretched hand…”). Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual breath. No paraphrase loops or scaffold—each driftwood placement deepens stakes. Minor figurative density in peak beats (e.g., “lens a perfect circle of condensed sorrow”) risks overwriting but pays off by charging the closure image without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful—each sentence advances character, stakes, or atmosphere. Minor overwriting appears in two high-pressure beats (“sewing chaos into time itself,” “mechanical vertigo”), slightly muddying clarity. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are sharp. The final line (“in silent harmony with the eternal, watchful moon”) perfectly echoes the opening, closing the textural arc. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, though one metaphor (“tectonic groan shuddered through the mountain’s bones”) borders on cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (“clouds drifted like silent rivers,” “grief a stone in her throat”) and pays off in the shard’s reweighting. Minor overwriting appears in the final paragraph (“saturated with luminous peace”)—a touch purple—but doesn’t obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively to mirror emotional shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “spoons bent reality” compresses worldbuilding efficiently; “corrupted instructions left by the altered reality” links cause and effect cleanly. Figurative language is controlled—shadows as “sleeping serpents or folded origami” enhances without overwhelming. Minor redundancy in “quietly deliberate” appearing twice, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors earned peace, closing with resonant simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “shrewdly innocent precision” conveys skill and ethics in three words). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “constellation of understanding” and “living star chart” risk figurative density, though pattern-taught. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates purposefully, though “bone setting applied to belief” slightly abstracts the concrete closure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “reflectively vibrant” appears twice, and “pearl of stillness” borders on label-repetition. No scaffold loops, but “cool, safe luminescence” / “fireless constellation” / “aqueous radiance” risks synonym churn. Final paragraph’s rhythm soars without sacrificing clarity, though “quiet certainty” slightly abstracts an otherwise concrete closure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“Sunlight fractured…”, “Her thumb traced…”, “Kneeling on spongy moss…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“emerald moss carpets,” “velvety moss glowing”) borders on decorative but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or simultaneity errors; clarity remains high even in lyric passages.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic variation. However, figurative language occasionally overloads: “gnarled roots breached the soil like serpents,” “hope a constellation of unanswered questions,” and “dust motes dancing like forgotten dreams” risk stacking metaphors in close proximity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the density in peak beats slightly dulls immediacy. Final lines land cleanly, avoiding purple prose despite elevated diction.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful—figurative language serves accumulation (“vine tendril… pulsing with latent promise”). Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats: “liquid gold unspooled, spinning gracefully” slightly blurs cause/effect. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Final paragraph’s “memory of the harvest moon smiled” risks sentimentality but earns it through prior rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “flash-paper alchemist whose life revolved around beautiful vanishing” establishes voice and conflict in one phrase. Figurative language is purposeful—starlight “pools like liquid silver,” hope “takes root”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in “gnarled apple tree etched against a violet twilight sky” (slight redundancy in “gnarled”/“etched”), but no loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull the closure. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm mirror ritual pacing: slow build, sharp climax, soft release.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language (“liquid starlight,” “wounded season”) is restrained and resonant, never overwhelming. Minor scaffold appears in the mid-section (“He sketched… noting how…”), but momentum holds. The only artifact is slight synonym churn around “reflection”/“reflected”/“mirror,” but it serves the motif without looping. Final paragraph’s cadence (“The harvest was complete”) lands with earned simplicity, avoiding overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or action. Figurative language is pattern-taught (fractal, calcify, boundary-less) and pays off without muddle. Minor overwriting in “boundary-lessly trapped anxiety seeped… like cold mist” slightly strains coherence, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors the story’s cadence—quiet, deliberate, renewing.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “fingers mapped with fine lines,” “shaving held the lesson of tenderness.” Figurative language is purposeful—no muddle or overwriting. Minor scaffold in “harvest lessons from loss” slightly echoes prompt, but closure avoids artifacts. Sentence variety and paragraph cuts serve momentum; final line (“actively, purposefully harvesting”) recharges opening ink-stained hands.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language (“clouds pooled like liquid mercury”) is consistent and purposeful, though occasional overwriting appears (“shimmering tapestry of captured light and condensed memory”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively. Minor register drift in “compromise had been a slow tide” risks abstraction, but momentum remains unbroken. Closure image is sharp and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, setting, or theme. Figurative language is controlled—the “maze of intentions” metaphor pays off in the water’s path—and avoids muddle. Minor scaffold in “her movements were reverent, carving a narrow channel…” slightly abstracts, but momentum holds. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with action, and the final image (“measurable current flowing gently in the heart of silence”) lands with resonant concision. No loops, clichés, or artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly controlled—sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence, and syntax supports propulsion. However, “excruciatingly gentle” appears three times in close proximity, creating a paraphrase loop that dulls immediacy. “Petrichor nostalgia” is repeated unnecessarily, and the phrase “glacial hush” recurs without deepening. These minor scaffold artifacts prevent 9+ but don’t obscure closure. Otherwise, high information density and strong verbs carry the lyric weight effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is vivid and controlled, with high information density (“obsidian surface mirroring skeletal cranes,” “serene upheaval settled within her bones”). Minor overwriting appears in one high-pressure beat (“cathedral of deceit: each fabricated clue supporting the next”), slightly muddying the metaphor. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with the scene. Final lines (“carrying salvaged truth like a lantern”) resonate without redundancy, though one ornamental modifier (“golden glow”) slightly dilutes propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density (“rope... tapestry of intentional knots”). Minor overwriting in “storm-oak’s seed not as a relic, but as a promise—a secret waiting…” slightly strains cadence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (loom, thread, weave). Final paragraph’s lyricism earns its weight, though “tiny ark of memory” edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (leaves as “shattered stained glass,” garden as “living atlas”) and avoids mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting appears in the opening paragraph (“salt-thick twilight,” “bruised sky”)—two consecutive high-register descriptors—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Final line (“a bridge woven between two women across time, connected by a single thread of empathy”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: sentences multitask (e.g., “velvet doublet hung in frayed ribbons” conveys time, decay, status). Figurative language is coherent—light “paints ephemeral forests,” hope “blurs into breathless anticipation”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“intricate theories, each page a fragile bridge...”) slightly dulls propulsion, but closure lines (“fragile thing like spider-silk at sunrise”) are taut and resonant. No loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional figurative stacking risks overload (“kelp-drift peace,” “volcanic glass reflecting the migrating sky,” “vein of hope” in quick succession). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “scars can sing” appears three times—functional as refrain, not redundancy. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. One minor slip: “unyielding compassion” borders on abstract label, but is immediately grounded in the red thread’s physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “dry basins cradled dust and stone nymphs wore expressions of eternal thirst” establishes setting, mood, and theme in one breath. Sentence openings vary, rhythm shifts with scene needs, and metaphors cohere (“silent comma,” “breadcrumbs left by the Rememberers”). Minor overwriting in “liquid light erupted, flowing into the dry basin” slightly blurs causality, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density: “petals fell like tears of joy, each a tiny beacon” does triple duty. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in mid-text (“troubling serenity deepened; perfection was fleeting…”) edges toward abstraction, but never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold—every image serves momentum. Final lines are taut, resonant, and free of artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is controlled—“dusk bled indigo,” “grief migrates”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“faded mosaic of cerulean, emerald, and gold”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors butterfly lift—elegant, propulsive, resonant—earning high marks despite one or two stacked modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “crunched on the volcanic gravel” establishes sound, texture, and place in five words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (tide = absolution, pendulum = legacy) and pays off without muddle. Minor artifact: slight overuse of semicolons in middle section, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final lines avoid summary, resolving through image (“gull traced the pendulum’s arc”) that recharges earlier motifs. Information density is high—each sentence advances character, setting, or theme—but one or two modifiers (“searing reverie,” “ethically diligent”) flirt with abstraction without grounding in immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is controlled—“velveteen gloom,” “roots of ancient yew trees”—but occasionally veers toward ornament (“cobalt silo” repeated). Minor scaffold in “[18” brackets (likely generator artifact) doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “tenderly organized” appears three times with slight variation, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density (“drowned pines lay visible far below, silent archives of forgotten seasons”), varied sentence openings, and purposeful paragraph breaks. Figurative language is pattern-taught (kingfisher = plunge for truth; lapis = hidden promise) and payoff-earned. One minor flaw: slight overuse of semicolons and em-dashes in mid-story could tighten propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final lines achieve read-aloud cadence without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is masterful: high information density, varied sentence openings, and rhythmic propulsion that breathes with scene needs. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—“ember alcove,” “needle stitching silence back into song,” “thistled calm”—all reinforcing core motifs without muddle. One minor flaw: slight overuse of metaphor in the opening paragraph (“dying hearth coals pulsed like a slow, orange heartbeat”) risks density, but it’s pattern-taught and paid off in closure. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled—high information density with zero paraphrase loops. Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (e.g., “Each stroke was a hypothesis built from absence”). Figurative language is coherent: ash as snow, chair as metronome, dust as map. Minor overwriting in “profound somber marvel” slightly dilutes momentum, but closure remains sharp. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “plague ash, gritty and gray, holding only sorrow”). Sentence openings vary; rhythm mirrors emotional arc—tense during discovery, measured in resolution. Minor flaw: slight overuse of em-dashes in middle section creates minor cadence drag, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s “one layer, one fact, one preserved method” uses anaphora purposefully, not repetitively—it echoes the accumulative drive and lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“Her fingers closed around the small wooden disc… a silent plea against forgetting”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Figurative language is consistent (sound/resonance metaphors) and never muddled. Minor overwriting appears in “tapestry of mended threads” and “frequency had taken root,” slightly straining the otherwise grounded lyricism. Final paragraph’s “echo of shared breath” risks abstraction but is anchored by tactile details (frost, velvet, warm rosette), preserving momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “He had pruned despair and planted resilience” echoes prior lines without new pressure. Figurative language is dense but coherent—“liquid starlight,” “roots drinking deep from stories”—though “synaptic plasticity” appears twice with minimal dramatization, bordering on label-speak. No scaffold or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“stars pricked the indigo like scattered diamond dust”) but avoids overwriting. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One minor flaw: “involuntary truthfulness was not a choice but a condition woven into his bones” leans toward diagnostic label-speak, though quickly grounded in action. No loops or scaffold; momentum is sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (streetlights “daydreaming,” silence “velvety”) and purposeful, peaking without muddle. Minor overwriting in two sentences (“polished slate,” “amber streaks”) slightly dilutes momentum but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; sentence openings and paragraph lengths vary musically. Final line resonates by recharging “daydream” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“psychic silence heavier than the ocean,” “silt settled in intricate mandalas”—but occasionally overloads figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., “threaded light through darkness” near closure). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though one or two sentences verge on lyrical abstraction (“welcome for nuance made manifest”). Rhythm varies effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the final third, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “boots whispering against cool, worn stone” establishes tone and tactility in one stroke. Figurative language is controlled—“proofs bloomed across the stone like constellations” earns its metaphor. Minor scaffold in “boundless confinement” repetition, but it serves thematic cadence, not loop. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors climb: short clauses, then lyrical swell, then decisive click. No purple prose; every modifier pulls weight.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose—nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme—but avoids overwriting through concrete specificity (“saffron threads into rainwater,” “tears traced clean paths through city grime”). Minor deduction for slight figurative density in the opening paragraph (three metaphors in four lines), though they cohere tonally. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. The final line lands with perfect propulsion, echoing the opening’s moonlight while deepening its meaning—no artifact dulls the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful: “rosewater dread,” “thunderous veil,” and “bittersweet flavor echoing memory’s truth” serve atmosphere and theme. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“energy rippled,” “healing incantation”) slightly dilutes propulsion. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Figurative coherence holds—motifs (bread, leaf, water) accumulate without contradiction. Final paragraph’s lyricism earns its weight through prior grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Opening line (“bruised twilight sky”) anchors tone and setting instantly. Minor overwriting in peak beats—“profound silence,” “startling clarity”—edges toward elevated diction but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (time as prison/puzzle, tide as breath). Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic resolution: quiet, unwavering, engineered.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful: “fingers, cold as forgotten coins,” “sweet rot from spilled candy apples warring with the metallic tang of old blood.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (luminance, mirrors, paradox) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in “repulsive allure of decay” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line (“where a monster once whispered”) recharges the opening with earned simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “fractal generating a recursive nautilus spiral” conveys visual, mathematical, and mythic resonance in one phrase. Sentence openings vary purposefully (“Wind tugged…” / “He knelt…” / “A gust tore…”), and paragraph cuts heighten rhythm without losing clarity. Minor overwriting in “restless euphony” slightly blurs sense, but figurative coherence holds—clouds as musical notation, storm as collaborator. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with near-zero scaffolding. Every sentence advances character, setting, or pressure (“rust flowed like liquid light” does triple duty). Figurative language is coherent—light, fracture, and song motifs interweave without contradiction. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in mid-text, but no loops, synonym churn, or register drift. Final lines achieve lyrical clarity without sacrificing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled—ivy as woven tapestry, truth as seed—but appears frequently in high-pressure beats without muddle. Minor scaffold detected: “emotionally rational” used twice as label (though anchored in action), and slight synonym churn (“recapture,” “rescue,” “restoration”). Final paragraph’s cadence (“lighter than the clarity in his conscience”) propels toward closure without purple excess. No loops or simultaneity errors; rhythm varies naturally across sentence lengths.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “chains biting the dawn sky” merges sound/tactile imagery, “mud clung like reluctant farewells” embodies emotion. Minor overwriting in peak beats—“wrestled internally with the weight of countless untold stories” edges toward abstraction, and “hushed blaze” repeats 4x (functional but slightly redundant). No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“The colossal…”, “Elias…”, “His…”, “Uncorking…”). Final line (“notes already hummed to the stones”) resonates without strain. Information density high—every image serves character, setting, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“geothermal hum ceased, allowing a reclaimed stillness to rise”). Figurative language is precise (“dust motes dancing like forgotten syllables”) and never contradictory. Minor overwriting in “liquid light across water-stained spines” slightly dilutes momentum, but the closure beat (“ink glowed faintly, a permanent testament”) is flawless. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence—no scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“portrait missing its negative,” “woven from light and longing”—but avoids overwriting through rhythmic variation and concrete verbs (“polished,” “folded,” “ascended”). One minor flaw: slight paraphrase in “torment transmuted into tenderness, chaos given crane-form” echoes earlier phrasing without added pressure. Otherwise, high information density, clear propulsion, and zero scaffold loops. Final line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield: “raw perception stripping away denial” conveys epiphany, character, and theme in six words. Figurative language is coherent (geode as resonator, potential as ocean) and pattern-taught early. Minor overwriting in “soaring joy… fused inseparably with crushing weight” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final line (“ready to listen for the pools in the quiet moments”) earns its lyricism through prior buildup, closing the cadence with purposeful breath.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“stars pricked the violet sky like scattered diamond dust,” “gritty sigh” of stone) and avoids paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm varies effectively: staccato during drone focus, flowing during revelation. One minor flaw: “brilliant dimness” appears three times, verging on motif repetition without sufficient evolution—it’s evocative but borders on decorative refrain. No mixed metaphors, simultaneity errors, or purple prose; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. The final paragraph’s cadence lands with earned quietude, though the third use of “brilliant dimness” slightly dilutes its initial freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line efficiency. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “poisoning his sleep with visions of Elara’s trusting eyes” and “weight of unspoken words” repeat conceptual motifs too closely. One paraphrase loop: “manufacturing false memories” / “weaving comforting lies” within three lines. These don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+ by introducing slight redundancy in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“Mist coiled…”, “His fingers closed…”, “A subtle shift…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“furrowed hush of salt-stung silence” leans slightly ornamental), but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent (owl = vigilance, moon = neutrality), though “tattered banner” verges on cliché—costing full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “rosary beads, a prayer for forgetfulness” merges ritual and repression in one image. Minor artifact: “backlash of regrets” repeats slightly, but each use escalates (memory → physical wave → manageable hum). Figurative language is coherent—compass as “stone,” then “altar”; faith as “candle,” then “flame.” Final lines (“sorrow and hope intertwined”) avoid sentimentality through concrete action: paddling east, humming, seals watching.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “scoured Kael’s mind with clinical precision” establishes tone economically. Figurative language is purposeful (labyrinth as psyche, light as empathy) without muddle. Minor artifact: slight overuse of “fragile” near lake (“delicately robust,” “fragile strand”), but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence variety supports rhythm; paragraph cuts align with knowledge shifts (e.g., post-rockfall revelation).

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose maintains high information density without overwriting: “ghost-pepper dust that held starlight” conveys rarity, magic, and sensory texture in six words. Sentence openings vary (“Clutched...”, “From...”, “A silver fox...”), and paragraph lengths breathe with ritual pacing. One minor flaw: “sweet sorrow of memory” edges toward abstraction but is immediately grounded by “weaving through the orchard like a silent prayer.” No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “boots silent on earth suspended above the world” establishes voice and stakes in one line. Figurative language is controlled—“starlight bled silver” avoids purple excess—and syntax varies purposefully (fragments for ritual beats, flowing clauses for visions). One minor flaw: “saline benediction” slightly over-ornaments the tear, but it’s redeemed by the concrete action (thumb on crack) immediately after. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “hull a patchwork of salvaged starliners,” “ghostly map of love.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/shadow, stitching, gravity) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in “symphony of sorrow transmuted by love” slightly dilutes peak clarity, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with emotional cadence, and every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, varied syntax, and strong verbs (“exhaled,” “sift,” “unspooling”). Most lines do multiple jobs—character, setting, theme. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “vibrant silence woven from wave sighs, the mountain’s breath, and starlight’s faint rustle” risks mixed metaphor (“woven” + “rustle”) and slight abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences near the climax (“She released every bug… a silent prayer made visible”) verge on restatement. Still, propulsion remains strong, and closure image is undulled.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “shadow leaned close and every withheld breath carried meaning”). Figurative language is consistent—light/shadow as ink/parchment—and never muddled. Minor scaffold in “calmly inventive resolve” leans slightly toward label, but it’s immediately grounded in action. No loops, redundancies, or simultaneity errors; sentence openings vary naturally. Final line resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “waves collapsed without foam, sliding back to the deep like liquid mercury” does atmosphere, physics, and emotion in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Pebbles drifted…”, “Her elusiveness…”, “She saw fragments…”). Figurative language is coherent—aurora as “patient teacher,” star dust as “catalyst.” One minor slip: “borrowed dawn” slightly overused, but payoff in final paragraph justifies recurrence. Closure beat remains artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “storm-kissed wonder” conveys weather, emotion, and aesthetic in three words. Sentences vary rhythmically, avoiding monotony. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“furiously tranquil… every muscle vibrated”)—slightly dense but justified by character. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each image advances theme or state. The only artifact is mild figurative stacking in the climax (“rivers down her cheeks, mapping her own hidden topography”), but it serves the cartography motif without muddle. Closure line (“quiet courage of beginning again”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “sunlight fractured,” “dignified chaos,” “hairline crack in the paint” all advance atmosphere and plot. Minor overwriting in “symphony where logic composed the melody and intuition harmonized beneath”—slightly strained metaphor. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s rhythm harmonizes with theme, though “alchemy of waiting” edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “rusted iron beams clawing at a twilight sky” establishes setting, mood, and metaphor). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “defiant stars,” “stubborn hope,” and “vibrant yarn” verge on stacked modifiers, though pattern-taught. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies purposefully. Final paragraph’s cadence (“one poem, one stone, one seed, one molt”) risks template cadence but pays off as thematic crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is controlled and coherent—“mercury leaves,” “time’s cruel punctuation”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in one beat (“flickering compasses embedded in every trunk, their brass faces glowing, needles spinning erratically”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resolution: quiet, resilient, luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “obsidian shard veined with liquid gold” does worldbuilding, object description, and thematic foreshadowing in one phrase. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light motifs) and payoff-earned (glow intensifies with memory). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, stakes, or atmosphere. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “luminous” (three times), but never in peak beats—clarity at closure is pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“granite paths steaming,” “lace’s final curl”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (water/tide motifs) and coherent, though “rhythmically placid” repeats slightly disrupt variation. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; verbs are strong (“combed,” “diffuse,” “unraveling”). Minor deduction for two adjacent uses of “rhythmically placid”—a hairline redundancy that doesn’t obscure closure but prevents 9+.
