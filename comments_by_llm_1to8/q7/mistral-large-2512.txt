    Prose is generally clear with strong imagery ("canyon walls hummed with the weight of silence," "breath curling in the cold air"). Some template constructions appear: "She had been...once" / "She had spent the weeks since" / "She had thought" creates a mild pattern of past-perfect stems. Minor paraphrase loop: "the fire had come for her...not for her work, but for what she knew" restates the motive shift without advancing pressure. The closure beat is clean, but figurative density in early paragraphs ("veins," "testament," "bones") occasionally clusters without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are distinct. Minor scaffold: "The tuning fork case never left his side. Sometimes, he would strike…" and "It wasn't sound, not really, but it was something" are paraphrase-adjacent clarifications. "Eyes like polished obsidian" is stock. The closure beat ("streaks of crimson and sapphire bloomed… twisting into shapes") leans figurative without muddle. Information density is moderate; the weeks-long middle tells rather than dramatizes key learning.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, supporting the accumulative design: longer contemplative sentences early ("It was cold, heavier than it should have been...") compress into shorter declaratives at closure ("The light returned"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor scaffold appears: "He knew distress signals when he heard them" over-explains what the prior sentence shows, and "Then he saw it" is a stock transition. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is controlled and apt ("pulse of the city beneath his fingertips"). The final paragraph shifts to lyric register without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance ritual, memory, or pressure. Minor scaffold in opening: "That evening, as dusk bled into twilight" is stock time transition. Paraphrase loop: "They just need to be given" echoes "anonymous donations had trickled into the community" without added pressure. Template cadence in middle: "She carried… She'd linger… She'd ring… She would sit…" clusters similar stems across four beats. The final paragraph ("And in the amplified quiet of the ridge, the community listened") carries lyric resonance but "amplified quiet" verges on oxymoron without fully earning the paradox. No loops touch the closure beat directly, so penalties remain mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is specific ("jade tear," "camera obscura's wooden body warm," "fog around her thickened"). However, the prose carries light scaffold: "The memory was not hers, yet it fit like a key in a lock" restates the prior paragraph's established fact. "A pilgrim of sparks, that's what the old texts called those who walked the edge of memory and fire" interrupts the present scene for exposition. The closure beat—"She had healed them, but not in the way she expected"—summarizes rather than trusting the prior image. Figurative density is high but remains legible; no mixed metaphors or major loops, though minor paraphrase appears.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clean with strong imagery ("a shard of golden light that pulsed faintly when she touched it, warm as a heartbeat"), and the opening paragraph establishes voice and stakes efficiently. However, the piece accumulates minor loops and scaffold: "not from wind but from recognition" / "not as she had known her, but as she had been *before*" / "not into nothingness, but into light, into *time*"—three template not-but pairs within 400 words, creating a rhythmic drumbeat. The phrase "the texture of time" recurs three times without functional variation, and the genealogy knot (daughter/mother/bundle) is narrated with vague pronouns that obscure rather than clarify ("the child she had lost" in para 5, "her daughter" in para 8, "her daughter stolen by time before she could be born" in para 13—who is the subject of "her" in that final clause?). These artifacts dull momentum at peak beats but do not collapse causality outright.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—nearly every line advances situation or character. The opening paragraph efficiently establishes setting, relationship, and stakes. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is controlled: "the wall collapsed...like a dying beast's roar" works without strain. The vault description—"jars of seeds—some plump and golden, others shriveled but alive"—shows textural specificity. The final paragraph's "weight of hope" and "time for growing" lean slightly toward abstraction but don't obscure the closure action.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied; sentences open diversely. Information density is high in the opening and middle, though the climax ("he fed a sheet of silver foil into the forge, watching as the heat turned it molten") compresses the pivotal act into summary rather than moment-by-moment tactile detail. Minor loops: "colors themselves" and "colors of it" repeat the synesthesia motif without advancing it; "he believed in" / "he had believed" structure recurs. No major grammar or clarity issues. The forge-and-foil sequence is legible but thin on physical specificity—what does an "imprint of silence" look like on cooled foil? The vagueness at the closure beat slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "her heart beat like a drum calling her forward," "the sound ringing like a bell in the hush," "liquid starlight," "shadows merging into one." Mixed metaphor: moonbeams described as both trapped fireflies and liquid starlight without reconciling the vehicles. Template cadence: three consecutive paragraphs in the Kael exchange open with short declarative sentences ("The man glanced up." "Lira's breath hitched." "The jar... pulsed faintly.") creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loop: "He didn't steal. He reinterpreted" restates the poet/spy idea already delivered two lines prior. Figurative density in the final third (amber/violet sky, jar pulsing, shadows merging, heart-as-drum) obscures propulsion and dulls the closure image with stacked ornament. The artifacts cluster in the ending, triggering the 9+ disqualification and high-band cap per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong imagery ("dying bees," "chorus of old ghosts"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: the bookmark's cracked state is restated across three paragraphs without added pressure, and "the thawing heart of the world" is named twice in near-identical phrasing. The orb description ("half-formed," "too fragile, too exposed") recycles the same idea. Template cadence in the calibration passage ("Now, the temperature regulators…And here, the final calibration") is voice-motivated but borders on repetitive. Apply −0.4 for paraphrase loops; no artifacts touch closure beat, so no 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies; opening sentences are textured. Some stock metaphors appear: "her pulse hammering in her throat," "her fear a living thing," "the betrayal was transformative." The phrase "firmly adaptive, bending without snapping" reads as scaffold exposition. "The truth had unraveled her" followed by "it had sharpened her" loops the transformation concept without adding pressure. Clarity is high; no major loops in peak beats. Propulsion is steady but the final paragraph front-loads theme rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid. Minor scaffold appears: "She realized then" and "she knew" are repeated filter constructions. Figurative language clusters densely in high-pressure beats without always adding clarity ("ambered hush, a warmth"; "marbled blue, like the heart of a storm that had forgotten how to rage"). Paraphrase loop: the oracle's not-needing-to-speak is restated in adjacent sentences near the end. No major loops, but density without propulsion in the middle third slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with varied syntax. Strong images: "shattered mirror," "crack like breaking glass," "bridge between the physical and the ephemeral." Minor scaffolding: "But there it was, pristine and untouched, as if waiting for him" is template phrasing. "The question never faded" and "the question burning in his core" loop the same content without added pressure (−0.2). "Then, in the thousandth loop—or perhaps the millionth—he heard it" uses false precision for effect but reads slightly inflated. No filter-verb stacks or major register drift. Information density is solid; few lines idle.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentences vary in rhythm and structure; information density is high (the ticket stub beat introduces doodles, faded seat number, and Mira's pocket gesture in three lines). Clarity is strong, and no paraphrase loops or template cadence appear. One figurative slip: "as if the world had slipped into a state where words had become unnecessary" in the opening is elevated diction that borders on abstraction without clear POV grounding, though it does not recur. Propulsion is consistent; no scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clear with strong images ("leaves brittle as old parchment," "flowers tiny and perfect"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: the garden "judging him" is restated three times in variant forms across early paragraphs; "mended deception" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment mid-story; and template cadence runs in the marble-placement sequence ("Each one was a question, a challenge, a plea"). One mixed metaphor: "the sun bled into the horizon" followed immediately by maze walls "rustling like whispers" conflates visual and auditory vehicles. These artifacts do not obscure closure but dull momentum in the second quarter. Density is generally high, but scaffold phrasing ("He was wisely pragmatic about it") intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "the quiet unfolding of something vast and unseen," "ripples on water," "the pendulums of a clock no human had ever understood" stack figurative language without teaching a pattern or landing causal precision. Paraphrase loops appear ("pressed her palm against the control panel, initiating the holographic interface. The projection flickered to life") and template cadence runs flatten momentum ("She reached... She had seen... She adjusted"). The nexus collapse sequence—alarms, AI demands, Elara's trembling hands—narrates reaction without information density. No sentence-level artifact obscures the closure beat itself, but density sags across the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; the prose advances atmosphere and plot efficiently. Minor loop: "The water wasn't just showing her things—it was *asking* her" followed immediately by "let it drift" reprises the water-as-agent idea without new pressure. Stock metaphor: "lanterns like a shattered mirror" and "breath fogging in the damp air" are functional but generic. Figurative density is high throughout (gilded balconies sagging, wood groaning like a sleeping giant, ink bleeding like tears, air thrummed with expectation) without pattern-teaching or payoff; the accumulation blurs rather than sharpens. No grammar errors; clarity is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character or situation. Rhythm varies purposefully, slowing for reflection and quickening during the descent. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "He had come here to find…" followed immediately by "The guilt had festered…" restates emotional ground. "Petals like shattered glass, roots coiled in impossible spirals" and "shadow's whisper" carry slight purple-prose weight but remain functional. The final paragraph stacks three resolution gestures in quick succession (weight settled, breathing without prophecy, illustration no longer a mystery), which borders on over-closure but lands cleanly. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Propulsion is strong through the excavation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings avoid pure template runs, but mild artifacts appear: "Elias crouched... Elias had heard... Elias froze... Elias followed... Elias stepped... Elias exhaled" clusters character-name sentence openings across the middle third. "The kind of" repeats four times ("the kind of scent," "the kind of explorer," "the kind of man," "the kind of cold"), a signature phrase that becomes visible. Information density is generally high, and the final line's hush image is strong, but the psychic-radio aside mid-piece interrupts momentum without clear payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose carries high information density with minimal redundancy. However, several passages exhibit mild overwriting: "the quiet regeneration of what had been broken" and "witness change without judgment" appear multiple times in near-identical phrasing, creating a paraphrase loop that blunts momentum. The metaphor "a forgotten tooth" (obsidian refuge) and "drink the water whole" are vivid, but stock phrases like "moving on without her" and "the thought passed, as all things do" dilute the texture. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs mar the high-pressure beats, and clarity remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and several images are vivid ("fine as spider silk, golden as dawn light"), but scaffold phrases recur: "ordinary magic thrived," "the quiet pulse beneath life's surface," "a shared moment" all feel template-like. The final paragraph loops thematically—"ordinary magic" appears three times in close succession, and "hush of dreaming roots" is reused without new pressure. Figurative density is high but doesn't muddle; no major loops or grammar breaks. Information density is moderate; many lines serve mood over plot.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: "The fragment...had been tucked between the pages of a ledger, its threads stiff with age. Dragons coiled across it in faded crimson and gold, their scales catching the dim light like scattered coins." Sentence rhythm varies naturally, opening stems shift, and figurative language (nautilus shell, pulse points, dying leaves) serves mood without stacking. Minor template cadence in two adjacent lines mid-story ("She had felt it first...," "She had spent her life...") slightly flattens momentum but does not touch closure. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; the final sequence ("It wasn't a pattern. It was a door. And the axis...") propels cleanly with zero scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short crisis beats, longer reflective blocks on Linus). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. "The beam above him swept the horizon, but his mind was on the microdot specs" balances image and interiority cleanly. Minor scaffold: "like seeds carried by the wind" and "like a metronome counting time no one else could hear" feel decorative rather than load-bearing. Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or deepen backstory. No figurative muddle in peak beats; clarity and propulsion hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short beats: "It was revealed" vs. longer layered sentences), and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the stillness had unraveled, fraying at the edges" is restated as "the canvas was cracking" without added pressure. Template cadence in the sound-layering sequence ("The first layer... Then came... Next, he added") stacks across three beats, triggering −0.4. Mixed metaphor: "shroud" (fabric) doesn't fray at "edges" in the same way "canvas" cracks. No filter-verb stacks or pronoun ambiguity. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (violet = ritual + visual motif), but scaffold phrases like "the question gnawed at him, sharp as a blade" add texture without advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are distinct. Information density is high in memory fragments. However, paraphrase loops appear: "chronologically homesick" is stated, then unpacked in near-identical terms ("not for a place, but for a time..."). The fortune-cookie phrasing ("conductor of unheard symphonies," "shadows have edges") borders on stock lyricism without clear grounding in Liora's idiom. Clarity and propulsion are generally strong, but these slips keep the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and peak beats (the float, the tablet touch, the door encounter) carry momentum. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The labyrinth was still there, but so was the way out" echoes "he didn't feel fractured… felt whole" without adding new pressure. Template stems recur in the labyrinth sequence ("He turned… He clenched his fists… He reached out"). Stock metaphor "map drawn by a mad cartographer" and the abstract "infinite permutations" lean generic at a high-pressure turn. No major opacity, but scaffold sentences and elevated diction ("periodically eternal," "mad cartographer") in peak beats reduce immediacy. Line-level control is solid outside these slips.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, several template stems recur ("He had," "She had," "It was the sound of") and the final two paragraphs rely on abstract constructions ("something she could hold, something she could play" / "The filament of hush had woven itself into something new") that summarize rather than propel through concrete image. No major loops or clarity breaks, but the closure beat would gain force from tighter, more specific final action or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high, though some passages loop conceptually: "He had been followed home, not by a person, but by the unshakable sense of being observed" is immediately echoed by "a prickle at the nape of his neck that refused to fade." The phrase "credibly curious" in paragraph five reads as label-only exposition inserted to satisfy a prompt requirement. Several figurative constructions in the final third ("a wound in the city's skin," "the storm recorder...was a promise") accumulate without clear pattern-teaching, and "Trust only what you can hear" as message text feels planted for the listening-beat payoff rather than organically motivated by the unseen sender.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled in most beats. The opening paragraph balances imagery with momentum. However, several passages loop or paraphrase: "The grotto demanded more than curiosity; it demanded choice" restates stakes without adding detail; "She saw…She saw…She saw" runs template cadence without acceleration. Metaphor density in the final third (liquid gold walls, rope burning cold, time as pages) approaches saturation without clear payoff for each vehicle. Filter verbs ("realized," "understood," "felt") cluster in reflective beats but do not fully flatten immediacy. No major clarity breaks, but compression could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically varied with strong imagery ("scales catching the dim light like scattered coins"). Minor scaffold appears: "This was why she had come" repeats conceptually in adjacent beats without adding pressure. The opening sentence stacks modifiers and passive constructions that slow momentum. "Chronic hush" recurs without functional variation. No major loops or artifacts, but density could increase—several lines restate atmosphere without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, with varied sentence openings and vivid images ("veins beneath his skin darkened momentarily, like ink bleeding through parchment"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the petal's faint static… The charge was deliberate… the petal's charge settled… the petal's charge began to fade" recycles the same content across beats without added pressure. "Subsume" (likely meant as "suffuse") and "refracting through the grotto's walls like a prism of memory" edge toward mixed metaphor. The final paragraph's "the grotto's amber glow warm her skin, just for a moment, before stepping back into the dark" compresses two states without clear sequence, and the "spent petal" description echoes earlier summary. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and minor register drift touching mid-scene beats.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is clear and mostly propulsive, with varied sentence openings and clean grammar. A few phrases lean ornamental ("the unseen gears of the world, the ones that turned without applause") and "cautious exuberance" in the opening feels like a prompt label rather than an earned descriptor. The closing line ("Somewhere, a cycle had begun again") tilts toward thematic summary. No major loops or artifacts obscure causality, but density could be tighter in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines doing double duty (the sculpture's "river stones" eyes both describe and evoke loss). Overwriting in the opening third: figurative language appears in most sentences ("weight of centuries," "whispers of lost languages," "invisible threads binding") without pattern-teaching, triggering density penalty (−0.5). Stock metaphor "eyes like polished river stones" and the phrase "luminescent ache" approach cliché. No major loops, but several lines hover near paraphrase ("not as they were, but as they might have been" feels slightly redundant with "glimpses of their kin"). Propulsion is present but occasionally slowed by ornamental phrasing in high-concept beats.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong imagery ("rooftops a labyrinth of canals," "time bent like wet paper"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "interrupted cadence, a rhythm just shy of completion" restates itself, and "the place where echoes were born" is repeated across paragraphs without new pressure. Template cadence in the middle section ("She knelt…then she heard it…She spun") and the phrase "as if" recurs five times, creating a rhythmic stall. The final beat ("world dissolved into light") abstracts rather than sharpens. Information density is moderate; some beats advance atmosphere more than plot.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong imagery ("fireflies into the dark," "sunlight through stained glass"). Minor scaffold: "He was here to understand" and "Tonight, he would try something different" are expository setups rather than dramatized discovery. The phrase "the mathematics of emotion—not the cold, rigid equations of scholars, but the fluid, fractal patterns" is slightly overwritten for the moment. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Information density is high in the middle beats (orchard exhales, eyes roll, warmth spreads). The final line "turned toward the path home" is clean and image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (the tape label, Voss's history, the cache location all serve both exposition and pressure). Clarity and momentum are strong through the outage sequence. However, several lines loop or scaffold: "The air smelled of old paper and lemon oil, the scent triggering a sense memory so sharp it nearly knocked him back" repeats the scent cue unnecessarily; "The creaking came again, closer this time" is a minor paraphrase of the prior beat. The phrase "frayed edges of his own frayed existence" is a decorative near-duplicate. These do not obscure causality but accumulate to dull line-level propulsion in non-closure paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clear and vivid with controlled rhythm; sentence openings vary and figurative language (bark "like warm wax," leaves "darkening as if singed") serves without overwhelming. Minor paraphrase appears: "She had spent years trying to control… but this—this was something else entirely" restates the control/surrender tension without adding pressure. Filter verbs ("watching as," "She had seen") cluster in reflective passages but remain voice-motivated. No template cadence or loops that obscure causality; information density is solid, though the closure beat leans slightly toward atmospheric summary rather than taut propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is controlled, with strong images (rain as memory-carrier, amber as trapped time, tide as ghost-bringer). Minor scaffold appears: "He understood then" is a tell-transition that could be cut, and "Some convergences, he realized" in the final line over-explains what the image already conveys. The cave description risks density without clarity—"forming shapes that made his eyes ache"—but recovers with concrete detail (woman's face, ship, reaching hand). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. No pervasive loops, but the closure beat's final abstraction slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high in the cave-description beats, though the dream sequence ("overlapping shadows…slipping between the cracks") loops the shadow concept without advancing knowledge. "Steadily unpredictable" in paragraph five reads as tell-label rather than dramatized pattern. Minor template cadence in mid-beats: "The pilgrim smiled…'I've come to magnify the magic,' she said. 'Here?' Elias asked. 'Everywhere,' she replied" follows predictable stem alternation. No major loops, and the pearl-crack climax propels cleanly. Clarity and concision hold; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with strong rhythm variation: "The ivory harbor glistened" (longer, atmospheric) alternates with "She wiped her brow" (clipped action). Information density is high; sentences routinely do multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs mar the text. Figurative language—"absences that gaped like missing teeth," "herald's trumpet valve…humming with the faintest resonance"—is controlled and voice-appropriate. One minor slip: "herald's trumpet valve" terminology feels slightly underexplained for immediacy, but the overall line-level execution is clean and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively (short declaratives at tension points, longer描写 during observation). Information density is high: most lines advance discovery or character. The opening line anchors voice and stakes; the closing train whistle recharges prior material. However, some figurative language clusters without clear payoff: "starlit vault," "veins of the world," "yawned open," and "heartbeat of something vast" within the first third create mild density without pattern-teaching. One paraphrase loop: "mystery unraveling itself, thread by thread" immediately follows "he was the only one holding the loose end," restating the same image. No scaffold or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high; most lines advance character, image, or atmosphere. Minor scaffold appears: "He scoffed at the idea then, but now…" is a stock pivot, and "something older, something like time itself" leans toward placeholder lyricism. A faint paraphrase loop occurs around "the tile wasn't just transcribing memories, it was sculpting space" followed immediately by "why had it shown him these particular moments?"—the second restates the implicit question of the first without added pressure. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs. Figurative language (symbols as constellations, memories as tapestry threads) is coherent and serves the moment without overwriting. The final image is clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.6)
    Information density is adequate; most sentences advance situation or atmosphere. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "The intrigue began…A figure materialized" restates Kael's arrival without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the opening paragraphs ("She sat…She was…She had stolen…She had outlived") with repetitive "She [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors ("like tides," "like a mirage," "like a chorus of the damned") appear in multiple beats without fresh specificity. The climax beat ("trembled," "shimmering," "flickering") relies on elevated diction that blurs concrete action, and the final image ("cold and inert in her palm") is clear but unremarkable. No severe artifacts touch the closure sentence itself.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in the first third (prep room, mother's death, diplomat's body, ink pot in one paragraph). Template cadence appears in the opening: "Not that he ran scams; he just kept the books... Not that... but..." and "The ink pot was. / It sat..." uses repetitive stems that dull momentum. Paraphrase loop: "She didn't flinch" followed by "'I need what he had'" restates her determination without added pressure. The phrase "But this wasn't math. / This was something else" is conceptual hedging that tells rather than shows the difference. Figurative language is controlled except for "shifting like oil on water," which is clear. No grammar or continuity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is mostly clean with vivid imagery ("frames thin as the veins in the bonsai leaves," "gilded paper in the dawn light") and good sentence variety. Two paraphrase loops appear: "a place of bustling trade" / "Now, the shop stood empty" restates the same contrast without adding pressure, and "he had always been drawn to the quiet" / "Today, he sought to refract time" cycles the motivation. Template cadence in paragraph 4: "The hum…grew louder" / "He turned…and began to write" / "He wrote of the stationer" shows stem repetition across three beats. The loops and templates dull momentum in the middle third; apply −0.6 in Q7 for patterned artifacts. Line-level clarity is otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift and figurative language (labyrinth, cathedral, magpie) enriches without overloading most beats. The "prying at the book's spine, as if the words might still be legible" is vivid and propulsive. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "half-remembered, half-erased" echoes "the rough, frayed edges of things half-remembered" within close proximity, and "just like his" repeats structure in adjacent lines. The closing paragraph edges toward abstract summary ("one story atop another, until the truth became something new") that slightly dulls momentum. No major artifact patterns but enough minor density slips to prevent 8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. "The sound coiled around his thoughts" and "the note hung in the air, trembling" are vivid and specific. Minor template cadence in the vision beat: "A woman… spoke… The man scoffed… she replied…" clusters filter verbs slightly. The phrase "the Ephemeral Compass was a race against the fading of history itself" is abstract and compresses a complex idea without embodiment. No loops or major artifacts touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clear and purposeful, with strong images: "circling like vultures," "dream half-remembered," "streaks of gold and crimson." Some template cadence appears: "She was a culture shock absorber... She was orderly intuitive... she was one of them" (three consecutive "She was" openers stacking trait labels). Minor paraphrase loop: "trust was a currency she spent carefully" immediately follows "a bridge... who could be trusted," restating the trust concept. The graffiti symbols and carnival choreography are concrete, but a few lines ("burden she carried like a second skin") lean toward stock metaphor. Momentum is steady; no major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean with varied rhythm and strong image specificity ("jagged crown of basalt," "ghosts" from creeping light). Two minor issues: the phrase "dawning hush" recurs without evolving meaning, and a paraphrase loop appears in the opening ("came to the moon not to conquer it, but to witness its quiet surrender" → "last undisturbed crater... soon to be swallowed"). No major line-level artifacts touch closure, and information density is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors. However, several phrases loop or edge toward stock: "the kind of smile that came from years of trusting" follows a familiar template, and "heart full" is generic. "Mist curled...like a living thing" and "magnetic" (in the final line) feel ornamental rather than earned by prior use. Momentum is steady, but a few scaffolding beats (e.g., "his breath steady despite the weight of the moment") could be cut. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing images are sharp. Information density is high—nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor scaffold: "She had come here for the maps, not the ruins" is immediately paraphrased by "She had come to this outpost for the same reason she always did: to find where things began," creating a conceptual loop (−0.2). The phrase "watching the condensation bloom on the windowpane" recurs productively, not as churn. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Clarity and propulsion are strong; the final third avoids summary. One paraphrase loop touches a non-closure beat, capping penalty at the lower end.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short beats at the archway, longer reflection on past towns, clipped action on day seven), and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in ritual beats ("three steps north, turn, seven steps east") but some scaffolding persists: "The tuner was infinitely patient" tells rather than shows through pacing; "a faint, rhythmic *click-click*" and "the murmur of voices, the clatter of carts" list rather than compress. Figurative language ("cloak the color of old bruises," "silence deepened, as if the town were holding its breath") is purposeful but occasionally stacks without added pressure. No paraphrase loops or major template cadence runs. One minor artifact: "he believed" / "he knew" / "he understood" filter-verb cluster in paragraph four adds slight drag but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is mostly strong: rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, and information density is high. The opening line ("distress signal pulsed through the abyss like a dying heartbeat") anchors voice and stakes. However, several figurative clusters risk overwriting: "jagged spires… slicing through the gloom," "honeyed poison," "threads from a tapestry," and "moth to flame" appear in quick succession without pattern-teaching. The phrase "starving thing" (twice: "gnawed… like a starving thing," "distress signal… dying heartbeat") and "liquid starlight" edge toward stock metaphor. Paraphrase loop: "The gathered hush was no myth. She felt it the moment she crossed the threshold" restates without added pressure. No major scaffold or template cadence, but density dips slightly in the middle paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Figurative language is dense ("beam long dead," "light that pooled in the corners like spilled wine," "lattice hummed") but remains legible. However, template cadence appears in several beats: "He had come to thread… / He had spent his life chasing… / He understood then… / He would keep running…" (stem repetition across narrative summary). Paraphrase loop: "thread the labyrinth" recurs three times without added pressure. The phrase "copperlight repose" is evocative but tonally drifts from urgent thriller to lyric essay. No major clarity breaks, but momentum sags in the middle third with reflective exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("silver breath," "honey dripping from a spoon," "rat in the walls of her ribs," "eyes like dying stars") and functions under the Accumulative lens, but several crowd single sentences without clear payoff ("threads unraveling at the touch" immediately after "frayed tapestry" reads as synonym churn). The phrase "lovingly venomous, a wound given with a kiss" and its near-echo "lovingly venomous, forever open" at closure risk template cadence. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs 10–11 restate that Liora has been running from the past. No major artifacts obscure closure, so penalties remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and sensory detail is vivid. However, density suffers from paraphrase loops: "She had begun to notice something strange: the same footprints… overlapping hers" is immediately restated in the next sentence. Figurative language is dense throughout (ribs of giant, syrup, forge shimmer) without clear pattern-teaching, creating texture that occasionally slows momentum. "Via overlapping sleepwalking paths" is a strained construction. Opening and closing lines are strong, but mid-section scaffolding ("That's what this place was") tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and opening/closing images anchor well. Runs of near-paraphrase appear: "This was no mere graveyard; it was a library" / "This wasn't just a tomb; it was a shrine" use identical syntax to declare meaning. "Days bled into nights" compresses the montage but also flattens the pressure curve. The final paragraph loops ("Faith was never lost" / "faith…never lost") and over-explains what the blooming roots had shown. Stock metaphors ("wound in the earth," "threads in a tapestry") appear without fresh particulars. No severe artifacts, but density dips in expository beats.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally clean with strong rhythm and no loops or template cadence. Sentences vary in structure and information density is high, especially in the opening and arcade descriptions. The figurative language is controlled ("liquid honey," "gilded mirage") without muddle. However, some stock interiority phrases appear ("chest tighten," "pulse quickened," "breath caught") that could be more character-specific. The final paragraph's "the ebony clipboard suddenly heavy in his hands" is a solid image but the immediately following thematic summary ("he'd been searching for his own [name]") tells rather than shows. No significant artifacts or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean and fluent with no major loops, template cadence, or grammatical errors. Sentence openings vary and paragraphs breathe appropriately. Information density is solid—most lines advance plot, character, or atmosphere without redundancy. The opening and closing images (golden leaves / eternal candle / stars) are purposeful. Minor issues: "echoed silence" in the penultimate paragraph is abstract, and "thread by thread" in the final movement feels slightly stock. No artifacts touch the closure beat; figurative language is controlled and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies well ("The mangrove roots twisted…" / "She had found it three days ago…"), and vivid images anchor each beat (gargoyle shard, condensation words, apparition's cool touch). However, mid-story paragraphs exhibit mild paraphrase loops: "The spirits sang…They knew her name, or at least the shape of her regret" reprises content without adding pressure. The phrase "half-remembered" appears twice in close proximity (scar "like a memory half-remembered"). Information density is high overall, but minor scaffold ("The medium had warned her…The medium had told her") and a few stock metaphors ("voices weaving through the humid air like silk threads") prevent entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in key beats (cast as palimpsest, coral as siren's song). Spatial choreography is clean: Lena leans over balustrade, boy below, casts align. However, three paraphrase loops appear: "The cast on her arm itched. She scratched at the smudged notes" repeats the cast-focus from prior paragraphs; "The anesthetic had kicked in... the anesthetic made her thoughts slippery... The anesthetic hummed in her veins" cycles without advancing pressure; and "shared anxieties" / "language of the wounded" / "fear could be unknotted" restates the same thematic claim. Template cadence in the Dr. Voss beat ("coordinates, a time, a name") is minor. Apply −0.6 for loops, no closure-beat contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clear and imagistic with purposeful detail (gnarled branches, ghost of a painting, chemicals swirling). Rhythm varies and paragraphs advance story. Two minor artifacts: "the way it slanted through the mist like liquid gold" and "the child's fingers trembled on the edge of joy" rely on stock metaphor vehicles (liquid gold, edge of joy) that dilute specificity in non-closure beats. "Something about it had lodged in her chest like a splinter" is effective but borders cliché. No loops or scaffold drag; information density is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("parabolic dishes," "note that wasn't there," "tongue a flicker of gold leaf," "question that coiled around Elias's ribs") and mostly coheres, but several metaphors are strained: "bewitched the stone, turning it pliable as wet clay" mixes enchantment with physical transformation in a way that blurs rather than sharpens. Template cadence appears in the awakening sequence ("The first awakening… The second awakening… The third awakening… The fourth awakening"), which feels mechanically scaffolded rather than pressure-driven. Some clauses loop: "the fresco resisted, its layers peeling back not to reveal the original, but something beneath it: a second mural, then a third, each nested inside the last like a series of Russian dolls" restates nesting three times. The overwriting and scaffold patterns dull momentum in peak beats; apply −0.8 under the patterned-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and sentences carry multiple functions. Opening and closing images anchor well. However, minor scaffold appears: "Elias exhaled through his nose, the sound almost a laugh" followed by "'Traffic,' he echoed" restates the same amusement beat. "The words hung between them, heavy with meaning" is a stock bridge. The final summary paragraph ("By the time the tax collectors noticed…") compresses key turns that warrant scene dramatization, reducing information density at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "cathedral of salt and silence," "blossom armistice," "reef-shadow joy," "half-sung lullabies," "photosynthesize pain." This creates textural richness but also overwriting—nearly every sentence carries metaphor, and some mix registers awkwardly ("ensconce," "postmarked from a galaxy," "shyly unstoppable" all within the opening third). Template cadence appears in the writing sequence: "He wrote of...He wrote of...He wrote of" across three sentences. Paraphrase loop: "the words came not in lines but in spirals" followed immediately by description of spiraling across the page. Minor pronoun ambiguity when "they" refers to projections in one sentence, then shifts referent. Information density is good; most lines advance atmosphere and emotional state. Propulsion slows mid-piece during the extended shell-projection description.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied, but several lines drift into decorative overwriting: "prismatic whispers that danced across the marble floors," "a melody without words... dissolving into the air like sugar in tea." Stock metaphors ("like a fossil in stone," "as if the library itself were a living thing") appear in non-peak beats. The final paragraph's "she realized she wasn't just saving names—she was giving them a place to live again" edges toward thesis-statement clarity rather than trusting the image to land the theme. Minor paraphrase loop: "preserve those vibrations" restated as "capturing the echo" within adjacent lines.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled, with vivid images (ink well pulsing, books sliding, light erupting) advancing pressure. Information density is high; most lines do double work. Minor patterns: "The archive [verb]" structure repeats (hummed, trembled, erupted, doors creaked) across key beats without taught payoff, creating mild template cadence. "She had spent years" and "for the first time in centuries" anchor backstory but edge toward summary in high-pressure moments. No loops or major artifacts touch the closure, which remains imagistically clean ("dipped her pen into the air").

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    Several paraphrase loops: "the amphitheater breathed" reappears in varied phrasing without added pressure; "trembling hands" cycles through label mentions. Template cadence in the letter-reading sequence: "She knelt... She traced... She pulled... She read." Stock metaphors: "silver river," "dried tears," "the way her pulse thrummed in her throat." These artifacts cluster but do not obscure causality. Information density is moderate; some sentences advance atmosphere without plot. Rhythm varies adequately outside the templated beats.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is mostly clean with vivid specifics ("rust-red stone," "water-stained ledger," "slow decay"). Rhythm varies and sentences do multiple jobs. Two minor issues: "Each one a tiny world, each path a story" edge toward stock lyricism, and "her shadow cutting through the skylight's glow" is a small spatial impossibility (shadow can't cut *through* glow without repositioning light source). A faint template cadence in the revelation sequence ("About the songs. About the fire."). Overall momentum is strong with no major loops.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "jagged rainbows…stretched like broken promises," "wood…whispering of storms and stillness," "prism's rainbow edges slicing through the air." In peak beats (Elias's final realization), metaphor accumulates without always clarifying pressure—"fractured hush swallowing his footsteps" ornaments rather than propels. Paraphrase appears: "the necessary distances she had put between them" is restated conceptually in later paragraphs. Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports atmosphere. Information density is moderate; some lines (weather code description, butterfly effect aside) add texture but do not advance present stakes. Minor template cadence in reflection blocks. Deductions: figurative density in high-pressure beats −0.5, paraphrase loop −0.2, scaffold in backstory −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and rhythm varies appropriately. Minor scaffold appears in paired constructions: "not just an artifact… it's a key," "not a ruin… it's alive." The phrase "rhythm of belonging" recurs four times without evolving in meaning, creating a paraphrase loop. Figurative language is vivid but occasionally generic ("like a dying star," "like an embrace"). Information density is adequate; no major clarity or propulsion issues.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clean, but several loops and scaffolds appear. "Missing pieces" is repeated across three paragraphs without functional reweighting. The phrase "the nature of her work" and "some things/pieces were meant to" create synonym churn at closure. Figurative density is high ("like a thousand tiny moons," "flickering like a dying ember," "like a wound") without pattern-teaching or added pressure, trending toward overwriting in descriptive beats. Information density is moderate; some beats (the bird-seed trail, the emotion-transliteration mechanic) are introduced but not causally developed.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, but several phrases loop or overwrite: "lightly attentive" appears twice in close proximity as a descriptor for both the arcade and the violinist, creating conceptual redundancy. "The way" repetition in paragraph four ("the way the water murmured... the way the stars seemed") is voice-motivated but borders on template cadence. "Orchestrated serendipity" and "ordering randomness" are restated concepts without added pressure. The closing paragraph's "exactly as it should be" and "something beautiful" edge toward abstract summary rather than concrete image. No major clarity breaks, but density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentences mostly propel without scaffold. Strong concrete images: "moss-slick stones," "barnacle-encrusted rope," "stars sharp as shattered glass." Two pattern issues lower the score: "as if" appears four times in close proximity (collarbone speck "as if the moon had claimed her," sky pressed "as if," tracing tides "as if pulling them"), creating template cadence. Second, "gaps between the stars" recurs three times with similar phrasing, weakening the motif's final charge. Overwriting in the opening third (vines "like a lover's whisper," cabochon described twice) slows entry momentum. No major loops or clarity breaks, but figurative density in non-peak beats reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and strong imagery ("breath curling," "tiny prison for the light," "skeletal cathedral"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or stakes. Minor scaffold appears in the dream-to-action transition ("not for work, but because of the dream"), and "as the fishermen called them" reads slightly expository. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is coherent and vivid without overwriting, and clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in most beats (scars + pack + fire history in quick succession). Two minor artifacts: "The moon climbed higher, and the words began to flow" is slightly generic, and "ragged, pale things" (scars) + "rough as bark" (voice) rely on stock descriptors. The simile cluster in the opening third ("liquid mercury," "shattered dreams," "water through cracked earth") risks overwriting but each serves closure payoff. No loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("cathedral of light and shadow," "hummed in the marrow of her bones"). Opening and closing lines anchor the arc. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "trial balloons" is explained twice in adjacent paragraphs; "the grotto was her sanctuary, a place where the boundaries between timelines felt thin, where the past and future whispered in the same breath" recycles the concept without added pressure. Minor synonym churn ("faint glow," "faint hum") and a run of "she had" stems in paragraph five. These artifacts dull momentum but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; each beat advances knowledge or atmosphere. Opening line is strong and the final image recharges earlier motifs. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "The ivy trembled, though there was no breeze. He turned, catching a glimpse of movement" could compress further. One paraphrase loop: "the walls remember" appears in both the diary quote and the woman's dialogue without added nuance. Figurative language is controlled—"veins of a forgotten god," "walls hummed"—and supports tone without muddle. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Proofreading is clean and action order is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer contemplative sentences ("She had first noticed it years ago...") giving way to shorter, urgent beats as the bells chime. Information density is high: most lines advance image, memory, or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the mirage was different" / "It pulsed...with something deeper" restates without added detail, and "borrowed heartbeat" appears three times without functional variation. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" without pattern-teaching or payoff, dulling momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor density slips: "requisite chiseled into stone like the names of the dead" and "aligned in their slow dance, Jupiter and Venus drawing near like reluctant lovers" stack decorative metaphors in the opening without pattern payoff. "The price of redemption was never just the signing of a treaty. It was the quiet moments after" is a brief paraphrase loop. No template cadence or major artifacts at closure; clarity and propulsion hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and individual lines carry strong imagery. However, paraphrase loops appear: the opening's "promise of rain that never came" / "thunder that never broke" and later "the echo would remain" restated across two beats dilute momentum. Filter verbs ("he would have laughed," "he had done it") stack in reflective passages without urgency. The closure paragraph summarizes consequence ("let the rain come, let the salt dissolve") rather than dramatizing it, softening the final image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose carries visual clarity and rhythmic variety, but several artifact patterns accumulate: synonym loops ("temple/prayer/shield," "whispered/whisper/whispers"), template cadence in the thread-untangling beats (three parallel "The [ordinal] was [color]" openers), and stock metaphors ("winter itself," "bones," "storm"). The phrase "alarming serenity" attempts oxymoron but lands as contradictory rather than charged. Figurative density clusters without payoff: "bodily poetic grace" and "between sigh and smile" recur as motif tokens but do not constrain action. Paraphrase loop: the final two paragraphs restate Liora's transformation with only slight variation. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and −0.3 for synonym churn = −0.9 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing images anchor tone. Information density is adequate. Minor issues: "The argument with her brother had left her raw, but it had also clarified something" is tell-summary where scene would sharpen. "Uncommonly serene" is a label without embodied proof. Stock metaphor "coiled around truth like ivy, choking it or letting it breathe" mixes vehicle (ivy chokes by tightening, not by breathing choice). Filter verbs ("seemed to move") in the candle beat slightly dull immediacy. No major loops or artifacts, but density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; specificity is high (twine knot, cicada husks, reed lattice). Minor paraphrase loops appear: "The grotto held its breath. The mist curled tighter, the moss drank the light" restates stillness without adding pressure, triggering a small deduction. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "the air was thick with the ghosts of migrations" and "the world had paused to listen" approach stock lyricism. Clarity and propulsion remain strong outside these slips.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, with lines often doing double duty (e.g., the rope's "resistance a quiet insistence that this work was sacred" conveys both texture and theme). However, several scaffolding phrases repeat structure: "He had come," "He had found," "He had spent," "He had learned," "He had not brought"—a template cadence that flattens propulsion across the first half. The figurative language is dense ("emerald veins pulsing," "steam from snowmelt," "a river of sound") but mostly coherent; no paraphrase loops or unclear action order mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("breath a damp chill," "wax melted under his fingers"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "The directive had been clear" followed by italicized restatement, and "He understood now" followed by summary of the same insight. Template cadence in dream beats: "She turned… She laughed… She pressed…" across three lines. Figurative density ("like vines around stone," "like the ribs of some great, slumbering beast") clusters without pattern-teaching. Stock phrase "burning in his chest" weakens the pivotal question beat.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"cracked bronze gates," "stars' true names," "wind through reeds," "liquid silver"—creating texture but occasionally muddling propulsion in peak beats. The phrase "dusky harmony of forgotten rituals" and "encrypted devotion" are evocative but veer toward purple. Sentence openings vary well; paragraph rhythm supports the accumulative design. Minor paraphrase loop: "The tile was empirically ironic: a tool of divination that defied logic, its patterns rearranging" restates the same idea across two clauses. No major scaffold or loops, but the elevated register throughout flattens urgency in the throne-room sequence where clarity would serve escalation better. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm variation. The opening anchors voice and stakes effectively. Some decorative layering in non-peak moments ("shifting grace," "breathing in time with some unseen rhythm") without payoff. Two paraphrase loops detected: "It was why she had come: to teach others how to release it, though she had never quite managed the lesson herself" restates the scheming-pacifist contradiction without added pressure; "the weight of her own resentment pressing against her ribs, a living thing" recycles the embodiment from earlier without advancement. Template cadence in the Veyra encounter: "You were there... And you were kind... But kindness was not enough" follows predictable A/B/C parallelism. Apply −0.6 for loops and cadence pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives anchor urgency; longer cadences for description). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "ribs of a dying bird," "comet's tail," "wind through chimes." Mixed-metaphor tension at "the fog curled around his ankles... in its depths, he saw a flicker" (fog as both physical and visual medium) blurs sense slightly. One paraphrase loop: "too afraid to return" / "too afraid to descend" within two paragraphs. Minimal scaffold; information density is high. No major loops or template cadence, but the peak climb sequence could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "its skeletal rafters now heavy with peach blossoms and the weight of time" anchors decay, life, and theme). Rhythm varies, though several mid-story beats open with "Liora + verb" or "The girl + verb," creating minor template cadence (−0.3). "Forgotten bag contents, she thought, though she knew better" is a paraphrase loop that restates the preceding action without adding pressure (−0.2). The closure image—peach juice, orchard, vows—propels cleanly. No figurative muddle in peak beats. Overall strong line-level control with minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies and supports the contemplative mood; figurative language ("each petal a fragment of time, each fruit a memory") is dense but mostly coherent. The piece suffers from mild paraphrase loops: "the shell remained, stubborn and silent, a puzzle that refused to be solved" echoes "the only object...that refused to reveal its purpose" without new information. Stock metaphor ("staring into the abyss and finding it staring back") and the recycled phrase "brightened disquiet" (used twice, including final paragraph) reduce freshness. Filter verbs ("she felt the weight," "she allowed herself") slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Deduction of −0.6 for paraphrase/template issues plus −0.3 for stock metaphor, total −0.9 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no algorithmic patterns. Information density is high in the descent sequence. Minor scaffold: "She had spent years..." appears twice in similar constructions. "Carefully resourceful" is stated rather than shown. Figurative density is elevated but coherent (mountain/bone, shelves/veins). No loops or paraphrase chains. Propulsion is steady. Grammar and punctuation are clean. The final line ("Some lessons...never meant to be learned alone") edges toward theme summary but lands as image-anchored realization.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening lines establish fog-bound atmosphere, and the garden sequence tightens. Some figurative density borders on overwriting: "vines made of whispered names," "flowers blooming in the dark," "petals that dissolved into mist" cluster in the final third without added pressure. Minor paraphrase loop: "as memories alter" (title) and "The deeper he went, the more the air thickened...with something that remembered" restate temporal distortion. No major filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Clarity and propulsion remain intact; the piece reads cleanly with strong sensory grounding. Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or symbolic freight.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is clean and grammatical with varied sentence structures. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "the rope resisted…but she persisted" restates effort without new detail; "the rope's braids tightened, then loosened, forming new patterns" cycles through synonyms. Template cadence runs in the vision sequence ("They were being erased…This wasn't exile. It was obliteration") use parallel negation without propulsion. Figurative language ("fables of absence," "echoes," "pulsed with light") recurs but remains abstract rather than image-specific. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clarity and momentum are strong; the causal chain is propulsive. Sentence rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor stakes and resolution. Minor scaffold appears in repeated sentence stems: "She had to move quickly"; "She had to act"; "She had to leave" in adjacent beats reads template-like under peak pressure (−0.4). "The bloom trembled, then began to shrink" and "Clutching the stone, now warm and humming" layer detail efficiently. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language ("edges curling inward like petals at dusk") is apt but the "soap bubble" simile feels slightly generic. Information density is high overall.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies naturally, information density is high, and figurative language serves purpose ("frozen tears," "dry leaves skittering across stone"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor issues: "The way it stilled the wind… the way it made his thoughts go quiet" repeats syntactic stem unnecessarily; "somewhere ahead, the beacon waited" slightly restates the prior pulse of gold without added pressure. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively. Propulsion is smooth; no scaffolding or momentum drag. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid, but density issues accumulate. Several beatsLoop conceptually: the fog solidifying is mentioned three times without new detail; "preemptively nostalgic" is glossed twice in adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence appears in the monument sequence (knelt, pressed, reached out) without variation. The phrase "the storm's hush deepened" recurs as filler. High-pressure beats (third monument) carry stacked metaphor ("echoes," "chorus," "waiting for someone to walk it backward") that blurs rather than sharpens. These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull momentum and clarity. Deduction: −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, −0.3 for register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level clarity is strong, with varied sentence openings and rhythm that modulates with scene pressure. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The blooming fortress stood…its stone petals unfurling" is echoed by "the fortress *was* blooming…Its petals were made of shadow" without added detail. Template cadence: "She had come…She had spent…She understood then" recurs across mid-story paragraphs. Figurative density is high throughout ("weight of the dark pressing down," "tide from shore," "gasped") without pattern-teaching or payoff, risking overwriting. No filter-verb stacks or major scaffolding, but synonym churn around "blooming" and "petals" slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Minor loop detected: "She didn't understand it, but she didn't need to—not yet" slightly recycles earlier interiority about approaching mysteries tangentially. "The stars were still watching. So was time" reads as elevated diction that edges toward thematic convenience but remains voice-plausible. No template cadence, no paraphrase runs. Clarity and propulsion are strong throughout; the prose earns its figurative density without obscuring cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and sensory specificity is strong ("spongy vines," "syrupy" whispers, "ozone and possibility"). However, several phrases loop conceptually: "intangibly tangible, a ghost in her palm that refused to dissolve" restates the doll's paradox without added pressure, and "the world had tipped itself inside out" / "gravity inverted" paraphrase the same event. Template cadence appears in the doll-handling beats ("She didn't know why… only that"). The mixed metaphor of vines as "fingers… reaching not to pull her down, but to lift her up" is legible but borders on overwriting. These patterns accumulate to −0.8 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies appropriately and information density is generally high. The opening grounds setting and stakes efficiently. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the quiet was different—thicker, almost alive" / "air itself had learned to hold its breath" restates atmospheric weight without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs in the final third: "The woman uncapped...hesitated...murmured" / "The woman closed...relaxed" / "The woman exhaled...scribbling...tucked away." Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh specificity ("like sugar in water," "like smoke," "like a needle through fabric"). Combined, these artifacts total approximately −0.8 in this category and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; no major loops or scaffolding. Sentence rhythm varies adequately, though some stock constructions appear: "no mere ruin; it was a threshold," "not of gold or stone, but of living wood." The final paragraph compresses multiple time shifts (chamber trembles, eyes close, eyes open, dawn arrives) without clear transition, creating mild coherence friction. The "until sunrise to decide" line arrives too late to have shaped prior beats, reading as retrofitted urgency. Information density is moderate; several beats describe discoveries without advancing pressure or cost. No template cadence or paraphrase loops, but figurative language occasionally stacks without payoff ("kaleidoscopic," "prismatic," "liquid stained glass" in the opening).

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and several images are striking ("silver dust," "creeping mold across a forgotten loaf"). Clarity is high and no major loops appear. However, three artifacts lower the score: (1) "burns bridges carefully" and "cutting off all contact" are near-synonym restatements within two paragraphs; (2) "suffocating" as a noun ("teach suffocating to breathe") is a strained nominalization that reads ornamental; (3) the phrase "linking through scars" appears twice in close proximity as thematic echo rather than propulsion. These do not touch the closure beat directly but create mid-story drag. Information density is good overall, and the final line avoids scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the porthole sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "pressure isn't just force. It's potential" echoes Mara's earlier diamond metaphor without adding new pressure, and "the bolt in his pocket grew cold" / "the bolt now just a bolt" / "the diamond in his pocket was warm" form a repetitive symbolic triplet. The opening's passive constructions ("had come," "had swallowed") dilute propulsion. No major artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is purposeful ("the handle grew warm," "the room blurred"), but several lines loop or paraphrase without adding pressure: "hadn't fallen. It had been *erased*" echoes "hadn't just been forgotten. It had been *silenced*" in the final beat. Elevated metaphors ("sharp and sudden, sliced through his fatigue") cluster densely in the inciting moment. The ending delivers information cleanly but lacks propulsive compression.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies and sentences propel. Information density is high in beats like the program's discovery and the woman's entrance. Figurative language is concentrated ("reality thinned," "ink in water," "candle flames in a draft") but remains coherent. Minor template cadence in the final paragraph ("Or unravel it entirely" as a one-sentence afterthought) and some scaffold phrasing ("He had come...seeking something he could not name, only feel") slightly lower momentum. No paraphrase loops or pronoun drift. Grammar and tense are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports mood, but paraphrase loops appear: "The button was small, brass, and tarnished" closely echoes "He turned the button over in his palm, the weight of it unfamiliar"; "unknown histories" recurs three times in near-identical phrasing without accumulating new pressure. "Through accumulated dust patterns, Elias had learned to read" template-stems another paragraph's "That was why he had come here tonight, not just to catalog, but to unfurl." These loops dull momentum mid-story, triggering −0.6 in Q7. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (auric lagoon, liquid fire, jagged lines) remains coherent without muddle. Information density is high: most lines advance setting, character goal, or stakes. Minor scaffold appears in "She had known, of course—everyone whispered" (filter + summary) and "No one would remember the resistance. No one would remember *her*" (paraphrase loop), but these do not obscure causality. The final image's syntax ("the auric lagoon's glow painting her path in gold") sustains propulsion through closure. No significant loop or artifact clusters; clarity and momentum hold.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is adequate, yet several lines lean into decorative register: "prism atrium…fractured into spectral shards," "vested hush…like a held breath," "smooth stone…glowing faintly with bioluminescent moss." These phrases elevate texture without always advancing choice. Two adjacent sentences in paragraph three paraphrase the prophecy's danger ("drown in its own noise" / "swallowed by the clamor") without added pressure, triggering a minor paraphrase-loop penalty. The figurative density remains legible and no artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the piece out of heavier penalty bands but capping high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally maintained but momentum stalls in mid-story reflection ("If order could be found in chaos, she reasoned…"). Sentence stems repeat: "She had spent months building…," "She had never seen anything like it…," "She began to arrange them…" Template cadence across multiple paragraphs triggers −0.5. Purple tendencies appear ("ashen skyborne arbor stretched like a skeletal hand," "light bled into twilight") and mixed metaphor at "pulling her deeper into a world where the leaves were not dead but dormant, holding memories" blurs sense. The loop "prodded…gently" recurs without adding pressure. No line-level artifacts obscure the closure image but cumulative patterns lower band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high across beats (compass discovery, greenhouse descent, waterfall crossing, city arrival). Minor paraphrase loops appear: "The compass rose spun wildly… its needle pointing not to a direction, but to the churning water itself" is followed two paragraphs later by "the compass rose, its needle now still, pointing toward a single building"—structural echo without new pressure. "Uncertainly certain, the phrase echoed in his mind" is meta-scaffolding that externalizes rather than enacts. The final two paragraphs deploy template cadence: "A figure approached… Elias realized… The tinkerer adjusted… Elias smiled." No filter-verb stacks or figurative muddle in peak beats. Clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. Clarity remains strong across the chase from coin to carved name to Elias. Minor issues: "factually mystical" is jargon that sits awkwardly in narrative voice; the phrase "luminous with regret, but no longer heavy with it" layers metaphor densely in the closure beat without full clarity. A few filter verbs ("she saw," "she watched") appear but do not materially dull immediacy. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lyric and controlled with varied sentence rhythm and vivid imagery ("sky bled a hidden sunrise," "laughter choked by grief, sobs twisted into something like song"). Some figurative density borders on overwriting: "spectral confessions...slithered through the gorge" and "distorted notes of a misaligned harp" pile metaphor without always clarifying. Minor paraphrase loop: "the kind that masked pain" followed immediately by "the real thing, the kind that could stitch a soul back together" restates rather than advances. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he felt") are present but voice-motivated. No grammar errors; clarity generally high. Information density is strong in the opening, less so in mid-beats where atmosphere lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is vivid and controlled in descriptive beats ("trees pulsed with an eerie violet glow, their leaves absorbing the light"), but several lines loop conceptually: "Not forgiveness—he didn't believe in that anymore" immediately follows the mercy quest, restating rather than advancing. The phrase "The forest pulsed around him, the equations still hanging in the air" near the end paraphrases prior imagery without added pressure. Opening and closing lines anchor well, yet mid-story scaffold ("He had expected someone, though not this soon") dulls momentum with hedge language.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clear and rhythmic with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph cuts. Information density is high: the fragment "remembers the sea," the lens "shattered when the sea took it," the lighthouse "pulled under...by the weight of stories." No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor issue: "unfastened the clasp" and "unfastened the shutters" recur within a few paragraphs, a small stylistic echo. The final image—"a ship that wasn't there"—charges closure without muddle. Overall momentum is strong with strategic telling that compresses transit.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies (short crisis beats, longer observational passages) and information density is high—most sentences advance situation or character. Minor loop: "The dust here was thicker, layered like sediment" → "each stratum telling a story" restates the same idea without added pressure (−0.2). "She'd seen them before: the faces in the plaster, the whispers in the wiring" uses list-like construction but remains voice-motivated. The final paragraph's repetition ("The elevator would run… The ghosts would sleep… And Mira?") is purposeful cadence, not template artifact. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and clarity is high; no major loops or scaffolding. However, figurative density is uneven: "thread of sound that coiled," "droplets that refracted the light into a thousand tiny suns," "pooled like liquid silver" cluster without cumulative payoff, and some metaphors (frost "spoke of collapse and rebirth") lean abstract. The phrase "rustling awakenings" appears as a section header but is never integrated into syntax or dramatized action. Minor filter-verb stacks ("he saw," "he knew," "he understood") dull immediacy in peak beats. Information density is moderate; several lines restate the rupture concept without advancing it.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled with varied syntax and strong imagery ("ceiling arched like the ribs of some great beast"). Opening grounds voice and stakes; closing image recharges the shard motif. Deductions: paraphrase loop in paragraph 2 ("scholars claimed… but Elias knew better" restates the dispute without adding pressure); "burnished sorrow" and "baroque spires" risk elevated register that edges toward ornament; the phrase "not in data, but in verse, in the poetry of a civilization that had dared to dream" stacks abstraction without concrete payoff. No major artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at −0.8 cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph length modulates. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor loops: "the music boxes he repaired were just things" echoes "what if the fractures were inside him" without adding pressure. "The stranger" repeats as the sole identifier across multiple paragraphs; a proper name or pronoun variation would tighten. Figurative language is controlled ("patches of twilight," "crimson glass… humming faintly") but "breath coming in ragged gasps" is stock. No major scaffold or template cadence. Information density is moderate; some beats paraphrase prior claims ("the truth was, he had been wilting near dishonesty for years" → "ignoring the lies he told himself"). Propulsion is steady but not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high: "smokestacks like broken teeth," "condensation," "shattered moon." However, minor paraphrase loops appear: "the scent clinging" and "the scent thickened" restate without new pressure; "something older, something that made his skin prickle" and "something with the weight of memory" lean on "something" stems. The final paragraph avoids scaffold and delivers propulsion. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is strong in the first third (GPS failure, archway hum, slide shattering), but the middle section loops exposition: "timewoven alliances...are the threads that hold the world together when the maps fail" largely restates what the scene shows. Minor filter stacks ("He had always worked," "He didn't know") appear in reflective beats without dulling immediacy. Figurative language is controlled ("turbines...always learning," "threads of light") with one mixed vehicle: "turbine-hum" mapped to magic feels strained. No critical loops touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and momentum are generally solid; sentence openings vary and paragraphs create visual rhythm. Minor loops: "quietly driven" appears twice in similar phrasing; "spread across" recurs (lap, altar); "seemed to" clusters in the cathedral beat without clear pattern payoff. Figurative density is high ("honey in the dim autumn light," "whisper against the silence," "umbral tenderness") with some mixed metaphors (flowers "pulse" and "tremble" simultaneously). No major scaffold or pronoun confusion. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty but reflective passages occasionally restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is clean and propulsive with strong opening imagery ("brass shelves groaning," "claws"). Minor loops appear: "the diary's first entry" / "Miriam's last night" are set up clearly, but "the lagoon's surface" is described as still, then rippling, then still again without clear cause. The chase sequence compresses action efficiently, though "Elara grabbed the ledgers and sprinted" elides the mechanics of retrieval from the waterproof case. Sentence variety is adequate; no pervasive template cadence or filter-verb stacks. A few stock phrases ("cold as a corpse's touch," "eyes sharp as flint") don't obscure causality but slightly dull texture.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create visual flow. Information density is high in the opening (bottle, alchemist, setting, backstory compressed efficiently). However, paraphrase loops appear: "He didn't need their pity or their empty reassurances. / What he needed was..." and "He thought of the townsfolk... / He thought of the Wishwell..." recycle stems without adding pressure. The metaphor "alchemy of the mind" is strong, but "a flicker of movement, like a fish in deep water" followed by "a whisper of sound" stacks vague impressions. The closure beat—"the air in the cove felt different—lighter, charged, as if the very molecules had shifted"—drifts into tell-mode summary when the lanterns and hammer-sounds could carry the weight alone. Minor template cadence in the experiment sequence slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density is high: "The children had laughed as the sound rattled their ribs, but Elias had felt something else—the way the noise had *immersed* them all, binding them in its resonance." Figurative language is controlled and earns its place (wax "glinting," words "curling into the air like smoke"). Minor register drift: "venerable oath scribe" and "Book of Unspoken Vows" feel slightly ornamental in early paragraphs but stabilize. No artifacts touch the closure beat. Strong propulsion and clarity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is generally vivid ("cathedral of ice," "scream muffled by snow"), but density slips in places. "The texture of borrowed time was not smooth like glass, nor jagged like broken stone. It was *alive*" edges toward tell after prior show. Minor paraphrase loop: "The atrium was still icebound, the stars still distant" echoes earlier establishing beats without added pressure. Opening and closing lines are strong. Information density is high overall, though a few beats could compress further (e.g., the double statement of the hatchling sleeping).

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. The opening ("windblown sanctuary…clouds coiled like sleeping serpents") and closing beats are propulsive and imagistic. Minor deductions: "The rope was frayed at the edges, its fibers stiff after the glue dried" and the backstory block on microclimate tracking slightly stall early momentum. A few near-loops appear ("She had been…she had been…") and the phrase "credibly curious" reads slightly academic for the voice. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, so penalty remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm and sentence variety are strong in the opening and star-descent beats ("Its domed roof, patched with scavenged metal, hummed softly..."; "A star, falling not in a streak of fire, but in a slow, deliberate arc"). However, several reflective passages lean on near-paraphrase loops: "The station's purpose had long since faded... the stars had grown quiet, or perhaps the world had simply stopped listening" restates the same idea across two clauses; "He had spent years tracing the paths of falling stars, not to chart their courses, but to understand the spaces they left behind" offers elegant inversion but minimal new information. The figurative density is high throughout without overwhelming, but cumulative minor redundancies and the participle-opener pattern ("sweeping dust," "polishing the lenses," "tracing the star's descent") create mild template cadence. No major artifact touches closure, but the accumulation across the middle prevents entry to 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies without algorithmic runs; opening anchors voice ("a sea of cracked earth"), closing reweights covenant. Information density is high: each line advances setting, ghostly pressure, or Elias's stance. Minor phrase echoes ("the way their lips moved," "the way their fingers twitched") create intentional lyric pattern but edge toward template cadence in the middle third. No paraphrase loops or stock metaphors; "bleeding into the horizon" is conventional but apt. The box-opening beat is clean and propulsive. Figurative language (candle-flame flicker, dying ember) is restrained and concrete. Overall clarity is strong with no artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports pacing, with the opening anchoring voice effectively. Information density is high in the garage-sale and key beats, and technical clarity is strong. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "He needed to rediscover" directly follows the "*Remember*" beat without added pressure; "He understood then" summarizes what the next paragraph will explain; "the texture of time passing" appears three times across the piece without evolving meaning. Template cadence in the middle third ("Elias had seen," "Elias had once bought," "Elias began") flattens propulsion. The final two paragraphs compress epiphany into summary ("Elias understood then," "He had finally understood"), dulling the closure image's immediacy. No major grammatical errors, but the loops and scaffolding pull the score down.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence carries figurative freight ("hammered metal," "lace," "shattered stained glass," "living thing," "woven dawns," "bubbles from the lagoon's depths"), creating a rich but sluggish texture that dulls momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "She had spent years chasing beauty in the unfinished" is restated as "beauty didn't need perfection" and again as "Beauty lived in the incomplete." Template cadence: "She wrote of... She wrote of... And when..." Stack of filter constructions in reflective passages. The density prevents propulsion in peak beats (the moment she begins writing). Apply −0.6 for overwriting and loops.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear and often carries dual loads (e.g., "The wire would oxidize over time, turning green, blending into the bark until it was invisible. The trees would remember, though"). Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentence openings are diverse. Minor scaffolding appears: "He didn't fear death, but he refused to let the orchard die with him" reads slightly thesis-like; "The developers would arrive in a week. Elias had no illusions" could be compressed. The phrase "brazen calm" is told rather than shown in action. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and no artifacts touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Clean grammar and spatial choreography. Two frictions: (1) "the weight of his own skepticism like a second skin" and "replaced by something brighter, something like belief" are near-metaphorical abstractions that soften peak beats; (2) mild paraphrase loop in paragraph three: "dismissing...as a fool's errand, a relic of superstition" restates "skepticism" without adding pressure. No major artifacts touch closure, so deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Line-level clarity is strong with high information density in key images ("the planks laid where men had once bled into the earth, where the ground had drunk its fill and then forgotten"). Minor template cadence appears in mid-passage: "The reef was dead, the battlefield was a ghost, and the world had moved on. But the garden—ah, the garden was stubborn." The coordinating list structure recurs ("the flowers, the heron, the seeds") without escalating harm. No loops or scaffolding; figurative language is controlled and coherent. Slight reduction for "the language of decay and renewal" edging toward abstract claim rather than concrete demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats (phonograph discovery, Vey's message). However, several figurative phrases cluster without full integration: "carcass," "belly," "fingers of a corpse," "veins darkening like cracks in old bone" appear within close proximity, creating slight density fatigue. The final paragraph lists actions ("packed his bag… knife… courage") in flat sequence without propulsion. Minimal loops or scaffolding, but the closure beat does not accelerate—it settles into summary. Strong craft overall with minor slips in peak-beat propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings and lengths create visual flow. Figurative language is dense ("tapestry," "ribbons," "ghost of its purpose," "threshold") but mostly coherent. Minor artifacts: "the silence around him deepened, no longer empty, but full of possibility" and "It was gone before he could be sure" are near-clichés; "blessed pariah" and "temporally stretched" appear as labels without immediate embodiment. Paraphrase loop: the paragraph beginning "His motivation had always been simple" restates the setup without adding pressure. Information density is moderate; some lines (e.g., compass description) serve atmosphere more than plot. No filter-verb stacks or major template cadence, but cumulative minor issues prevent the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure. Some stock phrasing appears: "her pulse quickening," "her stomach dropped," "her breath shallow." The opening metaphor "a mouth of black ice and whispering winds" works well. Figurative language density stays controlled. A mild paraphrase loop occurs with "embrace the unknown" variations across opening and closing. Information density is solid; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "vein of forgotten breath," "penumbra between regimes," "luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra"—nearly every sentence carries metaphor, which taxes clarity in peak beats without a taught pattern that justifies the load. Paraphrase loop present: "the way borders blurred, the way people slipped between roles, the way history was written" and later "the way a hand trembled…the way a soldier hesitated…the way a child's fingers traced" recycles syntactic stems without added pressure. Template cadence in the historian's entrance paragraph: "He was…He had been…Now, he wandered…" The abstract register ("crisis actor who had once played the part…bleeding into reality") drifts from embodied perception. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty, others linger in conceptual restatement. Rhythm varies but leans toward uniform gravity. Artifacts touch the closure third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact-penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high ("The stone was there, nestled in the roots of the mountain like a second heart"). Figurative language is frequent: mercury veins, opalescent feather, breathing walls, tunnels-as-mouths cluster densely without always advancing pressure—apply −0.4 for density in high-pressure beats. Paraphrase-loop check: "understand the shape of home" / "home wasn't a place to return to, but a shape to carve" restates across paragraphs without added cost—apply −0.2. Mixed metaphor: "language flooded him, not in words but in sensation" mixes liquid (flooded) with abstract categories (sensation), reducing clarity. No severe template cadence or scaffold, but cumulative figurative density and one loop lower momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, figurative language is mostly controlled, and sentence openings shift purposefully. However, several overwriting slips: "distant thunder rumbled, not a storm's fury but the lull of some celestial engine grinding beyond the horizon, a sound that made the air hum like a plucked harp string" stacks three metaphors in one opener; "the woven hush" recurs four times as a set phrase, bordering on loop; "the platinum labyrinth in his pocket" appears verbatim three times without variation. The closure beat is clean, but the density and minor paraphrase loops ("the tapestry whole, the threads reknitted") across the narrative trigger cumulative line-level debt. Apply −0.6 for pattern density and −0.3 for phrase loops = −0.9 total within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.1)
    Line-level clarity is generally high, but overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence in the first third uses metaphor or elevated diction ("swallowed sound whole, then spat it back," "warnings were just another color on her palette," "weight of unspoken apologies"), flattening rhythm and dulling immediacy—apply −0.5 for density without pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears in the poetry beats ("Forgiveness is a blade... sharpened on the whetstone of silence" / "how it stood unyielding, a monument to what was never said")—each follows the same declarative structure without variation, triggering −0.4. Stock metaphors ("blade," "whetstone," "monument") and therapy-speak ("alive" as payoff emotion, "courage to speak") in peak beats add −0.3. No paraphrase loops, and grammar is clean. Total artifact deduction: −1.2 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("acid sea licked," "gears turned with a slow, grinding rhythm"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "make sense of the fragments" / "piece together" recurs across paragraphs without added pressure, and "half-remembered dreams" / "memories he couldn't quite narrate" / "things he'd lost, the things he'd tried to forget" cycles synonym churn. The final beat is clear, but filter-verb stacks ("wasn't sure," "had never mastered," "couldn't quite narrate") in mid-story beats dull immediacy. Stock metaphors ("shadow that stretched longer," "spectral fingers") reduce freshness. No severe artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at −0.8 for loops and filters.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no runs of identical stems or paraphrase loops. Information density is high in the cave-descent passage, and figurative language (phosphorescent veins, algae "pulsed like slow heartbeats") is purposeful without overwriting. However, the closure paragraph employs abstract diction ("the space between them, the place where memory and longing blurred into something like forgiveness") that softens propulsion and risks thematic summary. Grammar and punctuation are clean; no scaffold or artifact patterns touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    Syntax is varied and rhythmic, with strong sensory anchors ("damp earth, night-blooming jasmine") and clear propulsion through the experiment sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the way the world trembled" / "the way the air shifted" / "the way Maren's silence hummed" recycles the same stem structure. "Vibrations of intent" is repeated three times without evolving meaning, bordering on synonym churn. The final two paragraphs stack abstract claims ("purifying intentions, turning noise into meaning") that slow momentum. Minor template cadence in the storm description ("The rain fell harder, the air vibrated") but not pervasive. No major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful imagery (skeletal station, patina bronze). Two notable template-cadence runs: "He had found it… He had followed… He had spent years…" and "The censer was… The symbols… They told him…" create slight rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loop: the censer's function as map/bridge and its symbol-shifting are restated across multiple paragraphs without escalation. Information density is moderate; some sentences (e.g., the wind carrying salt and rust) add texture but don't advance pressure. No severe artifacts, but cumulative mild loops and stems prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. Minor template cadence in early paragraphs ("She had come here," "She had spent years") and one near-paraphrase loop ("It wasn't occluding truth—it was *amplifying* it" closely follows the prior whisper) trigger a small deduction. The metaphor "the orchard's branches groaned like a living thing" edges toward stock phrasing but remains functional. Clarity and propulsion are strong through closure; the final image carries weight without overwriting. No filter-verb stacks or major loops that dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "mist that curled like ghostly fingers," "breath escaping like a whisper lost to the wind," "memories… fit, like pieces of a puzzle," "opal planks." In the borrowed-memory beat, three consecutive sentences use simile or metaphor without respite, creating overwriting without pattern-teaching payoff. Template cadence appears in "He'd come to pass on… The memories, the grief, the unspoken love… all of it, borrowed and now bequeathed" (list-driven summary). Paraphrase loop: "borrowed memories" restated three times across adjacent paragraphs. Apply −0.8 for density + template + loop within the non-closure accumulation cap.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot). No paraphrase loops, template cadence, or synonym churn detected. Figurative language is purposeful and constrained (coastline of a landmass that no longer existed, bioluminescent blossoms pulsing like heartbeats). Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and resolve by image. Minor scaffold: "Without thinking, he grabbed a flashlight and a screwdriver, prying up the loose board" could compress slightly, but the transit is efficient and does not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative density is high ("luminous lines that pulsed faintly," "ozone and something older," "liquid silver"). Clarity is maintained, and grammar is clean. However, overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: the mirror encounter stacks metaphor ("mist," "weightless," "suspended between two worlds," "stars bled brighter") without advancing causality. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "The dreams had not been warnings. … The final warning had not been a threat." Paraphrase loop: "She stepped inside" followed immediately by "The deeper she went" restates entry. Apply −0.6 for density without payoff and loop. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, but the accumulation dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the prose carries multiple decorative phrases that slow momentum: "scientifically romantic endeavor," "a spectrum of choices, each hue a decision," "directed spontaneity." The phrase "palette of resolve" appears without on-page dramatization. Minor paraphrase loops occur (e.g., "to revalue the past wasn't just to remember—it was to rewrite its gravity, to make the forgotten matter again" restates the concept). No major clarity breaks, but peak beats would benefit from pruning ornament. Sentence openings vary adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally ("*The cabin creaked…logs groaning*"; "*He could burn it. Let the past stay buried.*"). Information density is high—each line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor lift: the final "*Or his future, come to drag him into the earth?*" echoes earlier imagery without redundancy, and the body-pressing-door detail is concrete and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies well (short exchanges, longer reflective blocks), and most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, several overwriting slips: "the kind of hush that muffled footsteps" is scaffolding; "emotional terrain in the way others charted continents" is abstract; "a vow" and "a key turning in a lock" stack metaphors without adding clarity. The etching beat is concrete and propulsive. Paraphrase loop: "mean something again" / "not just a clamp anymore" restates without pressure. Template cadence in the opening (apothecary–tailor–aromatherapist) reads list-like. Deductions total ~−0.8 for non-closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose has textural specificity ("jagged shards," "calloused from shaping clay"). Information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the ink crystallized at the tip, hardening into jagged shards" repeats the concept; "transform them or they'll transform you" / "scars into stories" / "failures… are stories now" cycles the same thematic beat without added pressure. Template cadence in the reflection blocks: "She had seen it before…," "She had read about this…," "She had spent years…" opens three consecutive paragraphs with identical structure. These patterns dull momentum in the middle third, preventing entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (e.g., the opening paragraph anchors setting, character, and backstory in three sentences). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphors are coherent and voice-motivated. The final image ("didn't look back") provides clean closure. Slight overwriting in the middle: "The air thickened, the way it did before a storm" is a touch generic, and "pure and trembling" stacks modifiers without added specificity. The piece avoids filter-verb stacks and maintains propulsion throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing images are charged. Information density is high in the first half. Metaphor density spikes in nearly every sentence of the void sequence without pattern-teaching or escalation payoff—"threads," "chorus of definitions merging," "knitting together"—which blurs specificity at closure. Paraphrase loop: "She had to journey inward…But to do that, she had to walk out" restates the paradox without adding pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the middle ("She had been…She had used…She had to") flattens momentum (−0.4). No filter-verb stacks or major scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high in physical beats: "adjusted the brass eyepiece with fingers that knew the weight of time better than most knew their own names" does multiple jobs (establishes trade, embodiment, voice). Some paraphrase loops appear: "The problem wasn't the key; it was the lock" restates what the prior paragraph demonstrated. Template cadence emerges in the countdown sections: "Fifty-nine. The station's walls... Fifty-eight. The hydraulic pipes... Fifty-seven. Elias picked up..." Stock metaphor "heat off a stove" and "like a kettle left too long on the flame" are functional but generic. The final paragraph achieves propulsion: "The clocks ticked. And the fjord quiet returned, deeper than before." No major loops or clarity breaks at closure. Minor scaffold present but does not obscure cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clean and rhythmically varied. Information density is high in places ("He'd called them 'lucid contradictions,' the kind of equations that made sense only if you squinted at them sideways"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the library's mica-pane lanterns flickered" returns as "lit one of the mica-pane lanterns" without adding new pressure; "the weight of the revelation pressing against her ribs" and "the moment settling into her bones" recycle embodied-emotion templates. Figurative language occasionally stacks without clear payoff ("probability was just a language for the universe's cruelest jokes").

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; opening anchors setting and voice cleanly. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Information density is high in the caller vignettes. Minor issues: "cultivated estrangement—that was what she called the way she lived" is expository scaffold; "melodically haunted, that disc" repeats without added pressure. The phrase "teach endings how to begin" recurs without evolving. No major loops touch closure, but cumulative minor redundancy prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and auditory texture. Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or thematic weight. Minor loop: "He had spent years transcribing…" and "He had tried to preserve her in other ways…" recycle the same stem and concept (past efforts) without added pressure. "The only way to truly preserve her was to let her go" is a touch of explanatory scaffolding that could be cut, trusting the locket's release to carry the insight. No mixed metaphors or register drift; clarity and momentum hold.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory anchors are vivid ("jagged edge catching the light like a shard of frozen starlight," "shadow detached itself… moving with the quiet precision"). However, several phrases lean into stock constructions: "desperately jocular manner a shield against the weight of his own solitude," "slithered through abandoned chat rooms," "heart's worth of diesel for a single, heartfelt apology." The final paragraph contains mild paraphrase loops: "the story had changed" is followed by "the station wasn't a hub for favors. It was a place where people came to learn…" which restates the conceptual shift without adding new pressure. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but template cadence in the middle third ("He had won it… he had sworn… Elias didn't care… He cared…") accumulates mild drag.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lush and image-rich, but figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats without clear pattern payoff: "air thickened like honey," "melody swelled, filling the clearing with a sound that was almost visible," "edges blur, her fears unravel." These stack metaphors and abstract the climax rather than grounding it. Paragraph structure varies purposefully; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Line-level clarity is maintained, but overwriting in the stillpoint scene (the story's closure beat) dulls immediacy. One distinct register drift: "uncharted emotional depths" reads prompt-like rather than voice-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual breaks. Sentence openings show variety (noun, prepositional, dialogue, action). Minor scaffold appears: "some truths were better left half-formed" and "maybe the truth isn't something we carve in stone" both assert the same idea without added pressure (paraphrase loop, −0.2). The pen description recurs cleanly across beats. One figurative cluster in the opening paragraph (moon, shimmer, watercolors, draft, red pen) reads as atmospheric rather than overwriting. Information density is moderate; lines often do one job rather than multiple.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; figurative language (light as scattered silver, words curling like smoke, moonlight as benediction) is vivid but dense—nearly every paragraph carries a metaphor, edging toward overwriting without hard violation. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The phrase "the way the" recurs structurally ("the way the light danced, the way the silence hummed") but reads voice-motivated rather than artifact. One scaffold moment: "It was the way the water held…the way the air carried" in adjacent lines trends slight redundancy. Information density is high; momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and most sentences advance story or atmosphere, but several phrases loop: "the arsonist's signature" / "the Ember Scribe," "trail of artistic creations" appears twice with minimal evolution, and "promise" recurs without charged escalation. "Volcanic tenderness" is a mixed metaphor (volcanic intensity vs. tenderness) that muddles tone. The opening line anchors voice, and the final line attempts resonance but leans toward assertion. Information density is moderate; the middle section (defaced portraits, tapestry logic) compresses effectively, but the ending rushes through collaboration without scene work. No catastrophic artifacts, but paraphrase drag lowers momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports pacing, with short beats during the escape. However, several text artifacts lower the score: "burning through his veins like liquid starlight" in the opening and "liquid silver" for the lagoon reflection are stock metaphor adjacencies; "the drumming grew louder" and "the drumming pulled him back" loop the same image without added pressure; "the serum was working. Or maybe it was breaking him" is a paraphrase couplet. Filter-verb stacks appear ("had been trying," "had loved," "had never believed") but are spaced and voice-motivated. The final third uses figurative density ("made of the same light," "bones of the earth") that charges the image but edges toward overwriting. Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Clarity remains intact, but the closure beat carries mixed metaphors (drumming on water, air, earth) that blur concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in the storm and labyrinth description. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Clean grammar and clear action sequence throughout. The figurative language ("like a fist," "like drunkards," "like a struck tuning fork") leans formulaic but does not obscure sense. "Sharp as a blade" and "clear as a bell" are stock; elsewhere specificity ("tarnished silver," "groove running down its length") anchors texture. No line-level opacity or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally—short declaratives ("Maris didn't turn") alternate with longer descriptive constructions—and information density is high (most lines do double work: setting plus interiority, action plus theme). The opening "cobalt dock glistened under the weight of recent rain" and the closing "The world was full of things that needed teaching" bookend cleanly without loops. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "The girl frowned" followed by "The girl's frown deepened" is a paraphrase loop; "Maris didn't answer. Instead, she reached..." is a soft template stem. Two small loops and one minor filter cluster ("watching as the patterns shifted") trigger −0.4 cumulative, but clarity and propulsion remain strong through peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is atmospheric with varied sentence rhythm and selective sensory detail. However, several lines loop thematically without advancing action: "the whispers were different" is followed by abstract description rather than concrete stakes, and the forest metaphor is repeated without new pressure. The phrase "the memory hummed in the walls" and "cradling that loss" are near-clichés. Information density is uneven—some beats (the ledger, the magnets) add texture but do not constrain the final choice. No major line-level opacity, but figurative language occasionally prioritizes mood over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the opening beats: "bare feet silent on the damp wood, her hands steady as she coiled ropes" economically establishes character through action. The scrimshaw description—"its surface carved with a map of islands that did not exist on any chart"—balances mystery and clarity. Minor scaffold appears in the final section: "The other workers stared as she moved among them, no longer trying to disappear. She coiled ropes with the same precision, but now her hands were sure, her heart unlocked" restates the transformation without advancing it. The line "her heart unlocked" is a dead metaphor that dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sensory detail is selective. The piece loops conceptually across multiple paragraphs: tea ritual described twice with near-identical narration structure ("First, the kettle is filled" / "Today, the tea is poured"), and the whittling object cycles without progression ("almost a bird… then a tree, then nothing at all"). Template cadence in the tea beats: "The [noun] is [verb]" stems stack across three+ lines. Apply paraphrase-loop and template penalties (−0.6 cumulative in Q7).

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("light pooled like liquid cobalt," "wax beneath her touch"), but several metaphors compete without reinforcing a single thread, and some border on self-contradiction ("cloud-shadow poet," "lantern-moth hush"). Template cadence appears in mid-story repetition: "She had come… She had spent… She closed… She began… She knew." Paraphrase loops also surface: the boundary-dissolving concept is restated across multiple paragraphs without advancing pressure. The final paragraph strings together abstract claims ("tremor of certainty remained," "walked through the poem") that dilute the closure image. Combined artifact debt of −0.8 to −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor scaffold appears: "He nodded, though he couldn't see her clearly" repeats information from prior lines, and "The jasmine trembled. Petals...unfurled" could compress further. Template stems recur lightly ("Elias [verb]" openers), and "innocently cunning" reads close to oxymoron without embodied cost. No loops touch the closure beat, keeping line debt modest.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and sensory specificity is high ("his hand still pressed to the lens, his breath shallow"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. However, several figurative constructions blur clarity: "vibrations traveled up his arm... like the nudge of a memory" and "the way the hum seemed to sync with his pulse, the way it filled the spaces between his ribs like a second heartbeat" stack metaphors in close proximity during a peak beat, creating mild register drift. The incomplete final sentence disrupts propulsion at closure. Information density is strong overall but the closure beat's opacity lowers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong, but several passages lean into overwriting: "absence a wound he couldn't stop picking at," "her eyes alight with the same quiet fire," and "vanished into the twilight like a breath" stack metaphors without added pressure. The phrase "genuinely artificial, as if someone had painted each one by hand" is redundant—"artificial" already implies human intervention. Template cadence appears in the origami-chase sequence: "At its base lay another origami figure … The origami was always there, waiting." Stock phrasing like "his breath shallow, his hands trembling" and "the weight in his chest loosening" dulls embodiment. Information density is high in the opening and middle, but the closure paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the stencil application and the clocks' chiming. No major loops or causality breaks, and rhythm varies across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and opening/closing images anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in card descriptions, and the prose avoids filler. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "reverse engineering" is restated across paragraphs without adding pressure, and "the weight of mystery" recurs with slight variation. Figurative density (oil-shimmer ink, sleeping-serpent tape, sedimentary record, puzzle-piece continents) clusters heavily without always advancing causality, risking ornamental texture in middle beats. No clarity breaks, but tightening would lift propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is mostly clear with varied syntax and vivid imagery. However, figurative density is high throughout without selective deployment—"siren song," "atoms of nostalgia," "fractured rainbows," "storm" in quick succession—creating a sustained elevated register that flattens urgency rather than modulating with scene pressure. Minor template cadence in exposition ("She had come to purify... Their downfall... The atoms of nostalgia") and the phrase "across the end of innocence" reads as prompt-echo rather than organic closure language. No major loops, but density without payoff lowers propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short declarative beats at closure: "Elias closed his eyes, listening"). Information density is high in the footage-comparison beats. Minor scaffold appears: "The shadow unbound" repeats as a label across five paragraphs without varied construction, creating template cadence. Paraphrase loop between "He had spent years studying it" and "He had spent his life chasing this moment" restates duration without added pressure. Figurative language is vivid but occasionally stacked ("bruised," "scarred wasteland," "trickle of dust") without pattern-teaching. No filter-verb stacks or major muddle, but the recurrence of stock phrasings lowers craft precision.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies appropriately: longer, layered sentences in the reflective middle compress to shorter, action-driven lines during the trimming sequence. Information density is strong—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor issues: "He'd believed in the goodness of people, in the idea that kindness could bridge even the widest divides" reads slightly generic; "shedding layers of doubt with every stroke" in the final paragraph borders on cliché. The opening and closing images (mist curling, notebook writing) frame the piece effectively. No loops or template cadence; clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence. Information density is high (the hourglass, scar history, tunnel descent, chamber all compressed efficiently). Figurative language is vivid and coherent ("sand like shattered glass," "moonlight through leaves"). No loops or synonym churn detected. The opening anchors voice and stakes; the closing image recharges prior motifs (scars, stories, coffee rings). Proofreading is clean. One minor note: "the anesthesia had worn off hours ago" introduces a detail (anesthesia, rib ache) that is mentioned once and never integrated into later action or choice, a small scaffold element that doesn't obscure clarity but adds no pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied with strong imagery: "emotions pooled like water in cracked pavement," "the weight of the unsaid." Sentence structure modulates purposefully between longer descriptive passages and shorter action beats. However, template cadence appears in multiple paragraph openings: "She had spent…," "She was here…," "She just had to…," "She closed her eyes…," "She could *see*…," "She reached for…," creating a repetitive subject-verb stem pattern across beats (−0.5 in Q7 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack). Additionally, "The film strip [verb]" recurs three times in close proximity without reweighting. Information density is high, no loops or paraphrase redundancy appear, and figurative language remains controlled. The scaffold stems cluster but do not obscure causality or dull the closure image materially.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the creativity-block passage: "trapped for months, locked behind a wall" / "stories…withered…threads tangling into knots" restates the same condition. Template cadence appears in the climax sequence: "She saw it…she lowered…she reached…she remembered…she laughed." Metaphor density is high but vehicles clash: stardust is memory, then living thing, then spring; aurora is gateway, then promise, then guard. "Unspoken words" are "not voices, but the hum of the universe" yet later they "murmured secrets"—mixing abstraction undermines clarity. Filter-verb reliance ("she saw," "she heard," "she felt") dulls immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and scaffolding weaken momentum: "But tonight, the dune was different. / It hummed…" restates twice; "He had never dreamed" / "not in your dreams" synonym-cycles the premise. Template cadence: "He turned, but…" / "He thought of…" / "He closed his eyes, and when he opened them…" stacks mechanic stems. Register drift into pseudo-scientific ("wave functions") clashes with the fable-like tone. Figurative language is sparse but "fractured like a lullaby sung through broken glass" mixes acoustic and visual metaphors awkwardly.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentences alternate between longer accumulative phrases and short beats. Information density is moderate—most lines advance atmosphere or the philosopher's journey. Minor scaffold appears: "He had come to this place after the sixth sense awakened" could compress, and "the sound of a thousand interlocking parts moving in perfect, silent harmony" stacks modifiers. The final paragraph's repetition of "the wild frontier" and "the wind carried him deeper" echoes prior phrasing without added pressure. No major loops or filter-verb stacks touch closure, but density could tighten throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph cuts create visual cadence. Information density is high in the cove sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "sharp against the fading sky" / "last sliver of sun disappeared" / "only a violet glow" restates twilight three times in quick succession. "The vigil in twilight had begun" / "The vigil in twilight was over" is a deliberate bookend but borders on template repetition. One filter-verb stack ("watched," "realized," "exhaled") in mid-beat. Stock metaphor: "stars burned brighter...as if welcoming her." Cumulative line-level debt −0.6 within Q7; no clarity break at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is largely clean with strong images: "towers clawing at the twilight like frozen fingers," "silence was a living thing." However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "The absence was deliberate—someone had removed it, and he knew who" immediately follows the empty-hole discovery without added pressure. "The cost of safety is forgetting" and "some silences are necessary" are near-synonyms within two paragraphs. Template cadence appears in the final third: "He took the paper… He placed the sheet music… And he would not let it go unanswered." Filter verbs ("seemed," "recognized," "realized") cluster in expository passages. Figurative density in the opening—"choked," "clawing," "seraphically mundane," "living thing"—remains controlled, but mixed register ("curated stillness" beside "bellhop") creates minor friction.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; no loops or synonym churn. Grammar and tense are clean. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and image effectively. Overwriting appears in clusters: "dust swirled...each mote a silent witness," "the weight of her purpose, which pressed upon her like the gravity of forgotten gods," "the expression sharp enough to cut" all layer figurative language without forward pressure. The metaphor "the truth...waiting to sunder his reign like a blade through parchment" mixes vehicles (truth as blade, reign as parchment). These artifacts in non-closure beats trigger −0.6 to −0.8 per the density and coherence checks, capping the category at mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is strong in the assembly sequence. Minor paraphrase adjacency appears ("The paths hadn't disappeared; they'd been hidden" immediately follows discovery of hidden pages) but does not obscure causality. No template cadence, filter-verb stacks, or metaphor muddle in peak beats. Clarity and momentum remain intact; propulsion is steady without loops touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is largely clean with varied syntax and strong sensory detail. A few phrases lean decorative without adding propulsion: "thunderous serenity" is asserted rather than shown, and "awkwardly confident in her solitude" tells the trait without embodying it in action. Minor template cadence in the rebellion backstory paragraphs ("The rebellion had ended… The fighters had laid down… Lira had been a child…") but not pervasive. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat. Information density is high; momentum carries through to the ending without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.6)
    Paraphrase loops appear in paragraphs four and five: "The elders had called it a relic" / "why had this single life been preserved?" restates the mystery without added pressure. Template cadence in backstory ("She didn't tell Lina... She didn't tell her") flattens momentum. Figurative density ("lazy coils," "prickling at her skin like static," "coiled around her thoughts") clusters without muddle. The unsealing beat tells ("the water churned") rather than showing sequential action, reducing information density at the climax. −0.6 for loops/scaffold, minor artifact in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats. Minor scaffold appears in exposition: "her sister's, the one she'd missed because…" could compress to free momentum. The orchid-watching beat is propulsive and clear. One figurative cluster ("knife twist," "funeral pyre," "pearl of stillness") in early paragraphs risks slight overwriting but does not obscure causality. Final line is concrete and grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully—short beats during peak pressure ("Elias didn't resist"), longer arcs for reflection. Minor scaffold present: "The walls of the library seemed to breathe" followed two paragraphs later by "The library's walls pressed closer" creates mild paraphrase loop (−0.3). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "darkness...a living thing, a current pulling him under" works. One mixed vehicle: walls "breathe" then "groan"—acceptable but verging on muddle. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; the opening "wind-carved encampment clung to the edge of the mesa like a half-remembered dream" shows purposeful cadence. However, several beats loop or restate without added pressure: "time slows in crisis" appears three times without new detail. The ink's behavior is described vividly but at the cost of momentum—adjective stacks ("faint, shimmering," "ephemeral patterns") accumulate. No major artifacts touch closure, but cumulative minor scaffold and metaphor repetition (spilled ink, liquid shadow) dull propulsion in the middle third, warranting a −0.4 to −0.5 non-closure deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Minor loop: "the past felt alive" / "the past to thaw" recycles concept without added pressure. "Bravely conflicted" in the Mirror paragraph is label-speak that slightly dulls immediacy. Otherwise clean: no scaffold, strong verbs ("hummed," "rippled," "slumbered"), purposeful compression in the final walk. Information density is high; every line advances or deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with varied rhythm, but several artifacts cluster: "engraved quiet" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs as a stock phrase; "tranquil blaze/blazes" recurs without reweighting; the final paragraph stacks three synonymous closure gestures ("world outside could burn, but here, life persisted. And that was enough") creating a paraphrase loop. Figurative density is high in the opening without pattern-teaching ("fracturing the light into a thousand tranquil blazes"). Information density is good in action beats (knife gesture, sandbag handoff) but the penultimate paragraph over-explains theme. No simultaneity errors; grammar is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. Strong lines like "Not the absence of sound, but something deeper—a void that swallowed noise whole" show controlled escalation. However, several beats loop conceptually: the opening establishes the echo quest, then paragraph three repeats it ("He needed the goddess's echo, not the garden's sorrow"), and paragraph four summarizes it again ("Kael had spent years chasing them"). Template cadence appears in the spike's backstory: "It had been given to him by a dying sailor who claimed it had once held together..." reads like scaffold. The figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "voicing silence" as the climactic act is evocative but borders on paradox without clear mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.6)
    Strong opening line and vivid images ("forgotten god," "gaslight," "molten pool"). Information density is high in the nib-handling beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The journalist's call had come" / "The journalist's voice had been urgent" / "The journalist's reply came" recycle the same anchor. "Orbits of regret" is repeated without added pressure. Template cadence in the letter sequence ("The first letter…The second…The third") is functional but mechanical. Mixed metaphor: "swallowing the last of the sunset" is followed by "perched like a forgotten god"—the dome is both mouth and deity. Figurative density in non-peak beats ("restless spirit," "dying man's breath") borders on overwriting. Apply −0.8 for loops and template runs per the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies, and imagery is mostly sharp ("rusted phonographs," "crushed amber," "meteor hush"). Information density is high in the opening and tattoo sequence. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "The laboratory fell silent. / The firmware dimmed, its screens going dark" restates the same event; "The cries had quieted, not because they were gone, but because he had finally listened" cycles explanation without adding pressure. Stock metaphor: "time folded in on itself" and "constellation tattooist" feel elevated but slightly generic for the focalizer. Template cadence in the tattoo sequence: "The first mark...The second...The third" is purposeful but the payoff ("a whisper: 'Stay'") does not sharpen the pattern. Minor filter stacking in "seemed to hum," "seemed to flutter" dulls immediacy. Cumulatively, −0.8 for loops and stock phrasing that touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with purposeful metaphor ("forgotten dreams," "spectral confetti," "broken promise"). Rhythm varies; paragraph lengths create visual breaks. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "The grotto's hush wasn't silence—it was emergent" is echoed by "The emergent hush wasn't empty—it was full," creating synonym churn (−0.4). Template-stem runs appear in the final third: "The mandala stilled. For the first time in weeks, the grotto was truly quiet. Then, slowly, the lines began to glow" (three consecutive short declaratives with identical subject-verb structure). Information density is high, but the closure beat's declarative rhythm feels mechanical rather than rhythmically charged. Stock phrases ("throat tight," "stomach clench") appear under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and most sentences advance character or atmosphere, but several paraphrase loops and template stems appear: "The past was a weight, but it was also a weapon" immediately followed by "She had learned to wield it"; "She would rename this place again. Not the Plaza of Ashes, not the Ruin of the Fireborn. She would call it the Courtyard of the Unbroken Name" cycles through renaming without adding pressure. "Warm coldness" appears twice without clear cadence shift. Mixed metaphor: "quiet furnace of defiance" (furnaces are loud). These artifacts dull momentum in the final third, triggering the −0.6 to −1.4 range and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. The opening ("garden gate creaked shut…silvered glow of the moon") and the coin-spin sequence demonstrate strong propulsion and clarity. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs are present. Figurative language is controlled ("whisper of silk and shadow," "reflection in a pond disturbed") without overwriting. The piece passes the read-aloud test with natural variation in openings and paragraph lengths. Zero scaffold or generation artifacts visible.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence structure shifts with pressure. Information density is high: most lines do two jobs (e.g., "She rubbed her shoulder, wincing, but her fingers lingered on the muscovite geode sliver in her pocket" = pain + fixation + object introduction). One paraphrase loop: "illuminate the hidden connections" / "illuminate hidden pathways" across paragraphs 4 and 9. The phrase "fractally precise" recurs three times, twice as pure descriptor without added pressure. No filter-verb stacks or major template cadence. Opening and closing lines anchor well.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in most beats. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "a voice like wind through dead branches, whispering in a language that wasn't sound but *pressure*" near-echoes "The words vibrated in her bones, not her ears," and the fossil is described as burning/biting/pulsing in three separate beats without functional difference. Figurative language clusters heavily in the entity-emergence paragraph (suggestion/silhouette/mist/heat haze) without pattern-teaching, bordering on overwriting. The closure image is clean, but these mid-story artifacts dull momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and most sentences advance character or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She didn't believe in prophecies, not really, but she believed in the weight of things" followed closely by "buttons, echoes, the slow unraveling of time" recycles the concept. "The truth, perhaps. Or maybe just the shape of it" is a hedged scaffold. Filter-verb reliance is moderate ("she had learned to listen," "she realized") but not clustered enough to trigger heavy penalty. Stock metaphor "sharp as a blade" and "riot of colors" lower density slightly. Information density is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. However, several prose artifacts cluster: paraphrase loops ("He had come here not to remember, but to forget" / "He had not come here for absolution, but for proof"), synonym churn ("courage," "absolution," "redemption" cycle without added pressure), and template cadence in reflective beats ("It was...It was...It was" in paragraph eight). Stock metaphors ("valley stretched like a wound," "mist curled like smoke") appear in high-density runs without pattern-taught payoff. Register drift into elevated abstraction ("the knowledge that some things were never meant to be fixed—only carried forward") clashes slightly with the concrete spy-trade lens. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in the middle third. Information density is moderate; some beats (paragraph six's pillbox opening) compress effectively, while others (paragraph nine's ledger description) summarize rather than dramatize. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −0.8 in Q7 for loops and template cadence; artifacts do not touch the final image directly, so no 9+ disqualification, but cap high-band entries at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing lines frame the piece well. However, several passages lean into overwriting: "the promise of home just beyond the veil," "a star pulled down to earth," "the chaos." The phrase "until rain gutters stop ticking" in the timeframe is mentioned once mid-story and not tracked or paid off at closure. Minor scaffold appears in "the way the crows had fallen silent, the way the river's murmur had thickened"—template phrasing that could be tightened. The figurative density in high-pressure beats (storm arrival, final crossing) sometimes competes with momentum rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies; opening lines are strong ("fingers brushing the dry clay as if it were a sleeping child"). Information density is high in the first half. Weakness: paraphrase loops appear in the final third—"The oasis was not resisting change. It was holding onto every version of itself" directly follows "It wasn't holding on. It was remembering," restating the same insight. "As chimney smoke flattens into the sky, so too did the edges of this place blur" is a strained simile whose vehicle (chimney smoke) feels imported rather than organic to the oasis setting. Minor filter-verb stacking in the climax ("He could hear it… The oasis was not resisting… He understood then") slightly dulls immediacy. No major loops or template cadence, but the conceptual redundancy in the closure paragraph costs momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is controlled in most beats. Opening and closing images are purposeful. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the harbor felt different" is immediately followed by "There was a quivering hush," and the "reflecting light" metaphor recurs verbatim without functional reprise. Template cadence in paragraph four: "He'd moved… He'd kept… He'd never asked…" stacks filter constructions. Micro-scaffold: "below, the harbor's quiet lapping… a sound that had always soothed him" restates soothing twice. These artifacts dull momentum slightly but do not obscure causality, keeping the penalty modest.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is mostly clean with varied sentence rhythm and strong specificity ("brass sundial," "obsidian shelf," "book bound in scales"). Minor paraphrase loop: "translate isolation into independence" appears in paragraph five and again in the final line, the second instance feeling more declarative than earned. Some stock metaphor strings ("voices lost to the wind," "weight of a thousand lives") and elevated diction in peak beats ("atomically reflective," "shimmering") slightly blur immediacy, but information density and propulsion remain solid.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies, and figurative language is purposeful in many beats. However, overwriting clusters in mid-story: "a whimsy so inevitable it felt like gravity" and "the sky fractured and reassembled in their depths" layer metaphor without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the final third ("She wrote... She folded... She tucked"), and the phrase "whimsical and inevitable" recurs as a descriptor without earned pattern. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the keeper's "Public secrets" and the artist's "This isn't a thread. It's a question" feel like thesis placeholders. Information density is moderate; several beats summarize transit or reflection that could have been elided.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with varied sentence structure. Minor loop: "Mara closed her eyes, listening to the static, the hum of the generator, the distant murmur of a world on the brink" recycles the list cadence from earlier beats without adding pressure. Stock metaphors appear—"powder keg," "distant stars," "mist"—but do not muddle clarity. Information density is acceptable; the subsonic generator introduction is efficient. The final paragraph leans on summary ("the weight of the night pressing down") rather than concrete image, and "cautiously hopeful" is repeated as a label. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies (short crisis beats, longer atmospheric paragraphs). Sentence openings shift. Figurative language is controlled: "silver veins," "living thing," "heat off desert sand." Information density is high; most lines serve character, plot, or atmosphere. Minor issues: "The sound was coming from the central chamber, where the old blueprints had been found" is slightly scaffolding-like (the blueprints are not dramatized). "Prudently adventurous" in paragraph six reads as a label rather than embodied action (he moves "light but deliberate," which *shows* the trait, softening the deduction). No loops or template cadence. The closing triad ("The stars above weren't just light. They were a map.") propels and recharges the motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies, and most lines advance atmosphere or plot. However, several stock constructions appear: "her pulse quickened," "her stomach twisted," "the figure stepped closer," recycled stems ("She had been," "She had drawn," "She was already"). Figurative density is high without always earning its keep ("the mist swallowing their silhouette," "shadows stretched long"). The final paragraph leans into abstraction ("dark line against the light of her remembered smile") rather than concrete propulsion. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but template cadence and filter-verb reliance dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high—most lines advance mystery, setting, or character. Minor paraphrase loop: "The nail had been the key all along—not just to the furnace, but to the truth. And the truth was that Elias hadn't been exiled. He'd been sent." The two-beat restatement ("the truth was... And the truth was") slightly deflates momentum at closure. Figurative language is controlled ("clinging like a dying man," "spongey dread") without overwriting. No major filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Proofreading is clean; no grammatical errors observed.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with vivid images ("guardrail rusted into lace," "valley sprawled in pixelated amnesty"). However, several lines show overwriting: "dynamically observant" and "sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" feel elevated beyond Lena's established idiom. The metaphor "luminous with disbelief" is striking but ungrounded—what makes a road luminous with that emotion? Minor paraphrase loops appear ("believed in the weight of small things" echoed across paragraphs). No major scaffold or template cadence, but density could tighten in reflective passages that restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high: most lines layer character, memory, and atmosphere. Minor filter-verb stacks ("had spent," "had watched," "had come") appear in early paragraphs but do not obscure immediacy. The figurative language—"beast too weary to move," "flare," "spirals"—is coherent and purposeful. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the final line lands cleanly without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and imagistic, with strong opening and closing lines. Sentence structures shift purposefully and information density is generally high. However, several beats exhibit paraphrase loops: "The dreams had been trying to tell him this all along, but he had been too focused on decoding the symbols to see the truth. The inscriptions weren't a puzzle to be solved—they were an invitation" restates the same idea across adjacent sentences. Metaphor density is high throughout; in the climactic paragraph, figurative language (temple materializing, inscriptions pulsing, flower blooming in reverse) stacks without clear propulsion, risking overwriting. Minor scaffold: "not as a chronicler this time, but as a witness" is a tell-don't-show distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the seed-planting sequence. Clarity remains strong throughout. However, several paraphrase loops and template patterns appear: "She had watched... too young to help, too afraid to look away. Now, she would do what he could not" recycles "too [adjective] to [verb]" stems. The phrase "glistened like wet teeth" is vivid but "black as old blood" in the next beat is a stock simile. The final paragraph contains near-loops: "The mirror... did not reflect her anymore. It showed..." could compress. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and synonym churn, plus minor filter-verb stacks in backstory. No loops touch the closure beat directly, so cap deduction at −0.8 total.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense in nearly every sentence ("bruise deepening," "ink into parchment," "folds of a sleeping mind"), creating rhetorical weight that slows momentum without teaching a lyric pattern or paying off at closure (−0.5). Register is consistently elevated but edges toward purple prose in peak beats ("star-strewn plain," "swirling tapestry"). Paraphrase loops appear: "The future had arrived early" repeats conceptually across paragraphs without added pressure (−0.2). Some strong images ("scar ran along his wrist"), but overwriting dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with strong image density ("moth wings and threadbare patience," "roots coiling around bones"). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, template cadence appears in the reflection passage: "She had spent weeks... She had not come here... She would not flinch" repeats the "She had/would" stem across adjacent beats, creating sluggishness (−0.4). "Fiercely gentle hands" in paragraph nine is a near-oxymoron that muddies the image slightly. Information density is generally high, with most lines advancing multiple jobs, and no paraphrase loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies, avoiding template cadence, and information density is high in the opening paragraphs (backstory, appraisal work, grille cloth). The pit scene accelerates cleanly ("wind howled," "yawned like an open wound"). Minor scaffold appears in "He'd failed publicly, spectacularly" (adverb stack) and "Facts didn't betray you. Facts were the difference..." (parallel stems that edge toward thematic assertion rather than propulsion). No paraphrase loops or major artifact debt, but the therapist's axiom and Lena's closing line feel slightly over-written for peak beats. Clarity and grammar are clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and most lines advance atmosphere or character (the arbor's hum, seed's pulse, cuneiform glow). However, paraphrase loops appear: "she thought she saw a shape—a figure woven from light" immediately followed by restating its elusiveness, and the opening establishes the arbor's pulse/hum in overlapping descriptors. Stock metaphors recur without transformation ("clouds below shifted like a restless sea," "scent of rain before a storm"). Filter verbs cluster ("she thought she saw," "she could feel") in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Information density is generally high, but scaffold phrasing ("The arbor hummed... its branches woven... pulsed faintly") front-loads description that could be interleaved more tightly with action.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled with high information density ("whirring lattice of gears," "phases of the moon...bled silver light"). Sentence openings vary and figurative language is coherent. However, one paraphrase loop appears: the creel's emptiness is restated in adjacent beats ("weight of its emptiness" / "not empty at all") without added pressure between them, triggering −0.2. A minor filter-verb cluster ("He lifted," "He set," "He chose") in the middle slightly dulls immediacy. Clarity and propulsion remain strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"confessions etched inside a seashell's spiral," "fireflies," "seeds"—without pattern-teaching or a clear payoff that differentiates peak from setup beats, triggering overwriting concerns. Paraphrase loop: "The bunker sighed around her, its weight lifting" followed by "no longer trapped but free" restates release without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the confession list and final-paragraph summary ("She walked on, carrying nothing but the quiet, and the certainty…") lacks propulsion. Clarity remains intact, but the closure beat is cushioned by metaphor rather than sharpened by it. Minor scaffold: "From her satchel, she withdrew the pearl" could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("ivy had swallowed," "wounds like a wounded animal") and good sentence variety. Information density is high in the opening and graffiti beats. However, several filter verbs ("she thought of," "she knew that") dull immediacy in reflective passages, and the phrase "daringly methodical" appears identically twice, suggesting template cadence. The line "She was a truth-seeking river chronicler, though the title felt like a lie she'd invented to outrun the real one: *failure*" front-loads the thematic claim rather than letting it emerge. Minor paraphrase loop: "the map in her pocket was useless, she knew that. But she kept drawing it anyway" restates without added pressure. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and figurative language (snake eating its tail, mist as canyon echo) is coherent without mixed metaphors. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The cipher in her mind unfolded with each step, its patterns shifting like the mist" and "Now, she traced the symbols in the air, watching as the books rearranged themselves to match" restate cipher-following across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence runs appear in the final third: "She smiled... She had seen... The first letter... The second..." (−0.4). Stock phrasing weakens closure: "set her free" and "the hour between two days, between two fates" lean on cliché rather than specific image.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is sharp ("sound like cracking ice," "dark rings overlapping in chaotic patterns"). No paraphrase loops or scaffolding. However, several beats lean on figurative density without clear payoff—"drank the midsummer twilight," "possibilities blooming like cracks in ice"—and the plants' voices shift from "screams" to "hisses" to "quiet" without embodied transition, creating mild coherence friction. The closure image is vivid but the prior paragraph's summary ("threads snapping, possibilities blooming") diffuses momentum. Mid-6 for strong craft with figurative overreach in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid. Paraphrase loops appear: "beauty and death were not opposites but companions" restates the earlier "beautician mortician" tension without added pressure; "the threshold held" is reprised three times in the final third with minimal variation. Template cadence: "She had come... She had spent... She had learned... She had found" clusters in early paragraphs. These artifacts accumulate to −0.6 in Q7 but do not obscure the closure image. Information density is modest; many sentences restate atmosphere rather than advance stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is vivid ("bruise above the clouds," "silver tines bent as if clawing"). Information density is high in the grotto descent and pool encounter. However, the final two paragraphs loop thematic restatement ("not about forgetting—it was about remembering differently," "not in the grotto, nor in the hairpin, nor even in the voice") and scaffold the insight with list-like negations. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she saw," "she understood") in peak beats slightly dulls immediacy. Opening and closing images are strong, but the explain-everything ending reduces propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at key beats, longer accumulations for atmosphere), and figurative language is mostly controlled. The mirror shard "pulsed once, as if in agreement" and the cloak "tightening" create propulsion without overwriting. Two minor artifacts: "carrying with them the weight of years" is a stock phrase, and "the spaces between them—the fear, the regret, the things left unsaid" lists abstractions instead of showing them through Veyra's concrete words or gestures. Information density is high; no paraphrase loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language ("invisible threads of gravity and time," "frozen breath") serves atmosphere. Clarity is generally high, but loops appear: "The platform trembled, the grotto's glow brightening" is echoed by "The grotto's light flickered" two paragraphs later. The phrase "rings in the pond" recurs without functional shift across multiple beats, verging on synonym churn. Opening and closing anchor well, yet the density of metaphor in the climax ("water was warm, alive, pulsing") risks overwriting without clear causal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Minor overwriting: "invisible roots," "living equation," and "weathered but unbroken" in quick succession elevate diction without clear purpose. The final paragraph stacks abstract terms—"pulse left wandering," "art of moving without motion," "knowing without seeing"—blurring the closure image. No loops or template cadence; information density is moderate. A tighter ending would lift the score.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is largely clean, but several stock constructions appear: "neither male nor female," "not darkness either," "the world tilted," "a sound like wind through dead leaves." The keystone symbol "pulsed faintly, like a dying ember" is functional but generic. Paraphrase loop: "The figure gestured to the fountain. 'Drink…'" followed by "Elias hesitated, then cupped his hands and drank" recycles "drink/drank" within two lines without added detail. The final image—flower as tiny star—carries momentum, but cumulative template phrasing (especially simile chains) and a few filter verbs ("He had come," "He had read") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and supports momentum through the descent and revelation sequences. Information density is high in the library beat (book title, vow mechanics, woman's arrival compressed into five paragraphs). Minor loop: "Tonight, though, the usual rhythm felt hollow" and "the thought of standing still made his skin prickle" restate restlessness without added pressure. Template cadence in paragraph 2: "Elias had always watched from the pier, but tonight, the thought… Instead, he wandered purposefully…" and paragraph 10: "She wore a coat like his… and in her hand was another key tag…" recycle "X like Y, and in Z" structure. Stock metaphor: "struck him like a bell" and "burning against his chest" appear at peak beats without fresh embodiment. No clarity breaks; propulsion is steady but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively ("The prophecy wasn't wrong, he realized; it was backwards" vs. longer accumulative lines). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic charge. Two frictions: (1) Occasional metaphor stacking without clear payoff ("ambered observatory deck" + "light trapped...like insects in honey" in the opener feels decorative rather than constraining choice), and (2) minor paraphrase loop in paragraph 4 ("meaning was slippery" restates "the more he learned, the less he knew" without adding pressure). The closure beats are clean and propulsive. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though "stellar doubt" in the final third introduces a phrase that doesn't quite land as embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Two scaffold issues: "frayed like the frayed edges" is a visible loop, and "half-forgotten, half-reclaimed" / "crystallized through scattered light" / "shards of glass" form a metaphor cluster that leans ornamental in adjacent paragraphs. Information density is high in the naming sequence; momentum breathes in reflective beats without stalling. The final beam image is vivid and propulsive. Stock phrase "the tip of a dying man's tongue" is minor. Paraphrase check: "The dead had no use for tears. They only wanted to be seen" borders on restatement but adds nuance. Overall −0.8 for loops and density in non-closure beats per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Two frictions: paraphrase loop in paragraph two ("hollow-eyed and whispering" restates the *Maris Stella* wreck detail without advancing knowledge), and the phrase "brittle devotion" recurs three times across the text as both concept label and closure callback, creating synonym-churn effect. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph with repeated "something" constructions. Information density is high but not every sentence advances pressure; the fishermen's tavern-brawl backstory느 ornamental. No grammar errors; clarity is solid except where metaphor stacks ("frozen river of blue glass," "spilled ink").

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and syntax supports the elegiac tone. However, paraphrase loops weaken key moments: "the stories had to be told" echoes "give it voice" within two paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("the bones of a forgotten song," "gasping for air") cluster early without fresh inflection. Figurative density in the opening (wind chime, twilight bleeding, dark mirror) slows momentum before stakes anchor. "The weight of the past settling into his bones" exemplifies unearned abstraction at a pivotal beat. Information density is uneven: the photograph trail is clear, but Mira's backstory summarizes rather than dramatizes. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paragraph rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the touch of wonder" is restated across multiple beats without added pressure; "Magic, like emotion, was not a formula to be solved" summarizes what the orchard and starlings already showed. Filter verbs ("she felt it most keenly," "she had learned") dull immediacy in high-stakes moments. Stock metaphors ("liquid gemstones," "captured star," "embers in a dying fire") cluster without fresh specificity. Clarity and momentum remain intact, but information density is diluted by restatement. No causality break, so penalties route here: paraphrase loop (−0.2), filter stack in peak beat (−0.5), stock metaphor cluster (−0.3) total ~−1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is controlled (arbor as cathedral, clouds churned, buckle glinted). Information density is high in action beats (knot, tug, thread, clasp). Clarity is strong; no pronoun drift or time confusion. However, paraphrase loops appear: "climbed here for the silence" / "nocturnal arbor" restate refuge without added pressure; "adjusted it absently" / "adjusted his grip" recycle gesture stems. Template cadence in paragraph 2 ("his fingers," "each ridge," "Elias had climbed") and paragraph 13 ("Elias tightened," "He had to move," "He began to climb") stack similar syntactic openings across three+ lines without pattern-teaching. Stock metaphor "dying stars" and "second spine" lack specificity. Deductions total ~−0.8 for loops and template stems, preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, alternating short action beats with longer reflective passages. The opening anchors voice and stakes; information density is high throughout. Minor template cadence appears in the combat sequence: "He moved... He lunged... He attacked." The metaphor "numbness cracked... into heat, into pressure, into pulse" is clear and purposeful. No paraphrase loops or significant scaffold detected. Propulsion remains steady through the departure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and the final image ("following him into the dark") closes with purposeful weight. Template cadence appears in "The first time… The second time… Now, they listened" and recurs with "He adjusted… The lullaby twisted… The imperfections were the point," creating a mild mechanical rhythm. Paraphrase loop: "He had done what he came to do" and "The unspoken had been tended to" restate the same closure content within two beats. Stock metaphor: "tended to them like a gardener to withered blooms" and "macerated into silence" elevate diction without fresh vehicle. Deductions −0.6 for template runs and −0.3 for paraphrase loop total −0.9 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sensory detail (frost, mist, cold pendant) is selective and advances atmosphere. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor density loss: adjacent lines in paragraph four ("The pendant had been a gift—or a curse" and "Now, as the mist thickened") restate arrival/threshold without added pressure. No major loops or scaffold, and figurative language (ink-stained fingers, galaxies in eyes) remains coherent. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is strong in many beats: "a graveyard of numbers," "the rocks beneath his fingers were crumbling," "something with teeth." However, several near-paraphrases appear ("He had been wrong all along. Not about the science, but about the purpose" restates the same insight across two sentences), and stock metaphor intrudes ("serpent" for thought, "frozen bloom"). The crozier's repeated description (gilded, jagged, snapped) loops slightly without added detail. Rhythm varies well overall, but peak moments occasionally favor poetic flourish over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph structure supports escalation. Information density is high ("the air thrummed with the echoes of old broadcasts and the whispers of distant stars" does three jobs: setting, atmosphere, stake). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("polished surface catching the moonlight like a mirror to another world"). Minor scaffold: "This was what she had been searching for" tells rather than shows the stakes shift, and "the tower groaned as if it, too, were straining to hear" anthropomorphizes without clear gain.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied; sentence openings shift and information density is generally high. Minor loops appear: "the ferry was vanishing" and "the *Maris* was a permanent transient" restate concepts with small variation. The phrase "the world's seams split open and let the impossible through" edges toward abstraction without grounding in concrete action. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks. The final paragraph's thematic summary ("resiliently positive, a permanent transient between the tides of time") reduces momentum with redundancy. Overall, propulsion is steady until the closing reset.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies adequately; no glaring loops or template cadence runs. Clarity is mostly clean, though some lines veer into abstraction: "the space between his dreams, where the rules of physics didn't apply but the rules of emotion did" tells rather than shows. Figurative language density is moderate but includes stock images ("liquid silver," "vein," "breathing walls"). Minor scaffold: "Elias didn't panic. There was a strange calm..." could be compressed. No major artifacts touch closure, but the void-space ending sacrifices concreteness for metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; no spatial confusion or timeline breaks. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "horizons had unfolded" / "unfolded horizons" early on, and the closure paragraph recycles "horizons had unfolded" again without added pressure. Template cadence is present in the experimentation summary: "They used...They built...It was slow work." Figurative language is controlled but occasionally strained ("abyssal plain...spires clawed at the dark"). Information density is moderate; the middle section summarizes weeks of work rather than dramatizing key beats. No severe artifacts, but momentum sags in the experimental montage.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose avoids template cadence in most beats. However, several paraphrase loops and near-redundancies appear: "not as a contact tracer for hearts, not at this hour, not when the dead called" recycles structure without adding pressure; "the ones who heard too much" echoes "those who heard too much" within a few lines. The phrase "persistently curious, the kind of curiosity that had gotten her into this mess" is scaffolding that could be cut. Figurative language is generally clear, though "the mist thickening into something almost solid" and "the mist coiled like a living thing" repeat the same vehicle. The final paragraph's "She was exactly where she was meant to be" is tell-only closure that undercuts the prior image work.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong sensory anchors and no loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short bursts at crisis: "Elias didn't answer"; longer accumulative constructions during descent). However, figurative language is heavy throughout high-pressure beats: "gold flecks...pulsed faintly, as if breathing," "walls slick with condensation," "membrane between states," "gold absorbed into the floor like blood into sand." This density is atmospheric but edges toward overwriting when most sentences carry a metaphor or simile without pause. The final paragraph stacks three echoing constructions ("The tide changed. The cables went dark. And somewhere...") which reads purposeful but risks template cadence. No clarity loss, so penalties remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character or atmosphere. The opening metaphor ("frozen jewel beneath the snow...fractured colors") is vivid and specific. However, some phrasing edges toward stock: "death certificate error survivor" functions as label, "borrowed time he didn't deserve" is somewhat generic, and "the way life could shatter in an instant" approaches cliché. The ghost's ink-pattern dialogue is fresh, but "One hundred and three, one hundred and four" recurs without escalation. Minor template cadence in the reflective middle ("He thought of...He thought of...") creates brief drag.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are mostly distinct, though a few template stems appear ("She had spent," "She had heard," "She pulled"). Information density is high at the tunnel sequence; the canyon-opening and backstory paragraphs carry some scaffold ("not to mourn... but to listen" reads slightly explanatory). One paraphrase loop: "echoes were not just sound, but texture" is restated as "rough as sandstone, smooth as river stone" without new pressure. The closure image is clean, but "quietly articulate in her triumph" is a stock phrase that dulls the final beat. No major figurative muddle, but the bird-flock analogy is stated rather than shown in action.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully ("It shouldn't have been there, not in soil this rich, not in a place where…"), and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "air…hummed with something gravitationally playful," "laughter…brittle, their joy souring into something jagged." However, stacked metaphors in quick succession—"harmony untamed," "bitterness…a kind of gravity," "frostbitten hope"—approach overwriting in the final third without sufficient pattern-teaching. Minor paraphrase loop: "not just a garden…a threshold" and "the rules were different" restate proximity without added pressure. Text-artifact penalty: −0.6 for density and mixed register in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and structure, information density is high, and no loops or paraphrase cycles are present. Figurative language is vivid and controlled ("iridescent husk catching the light like a shattered prism," "vines erupted from the earth and coiled around their legs"). One scaffold artifact: the phrase "resonantly soft" recurs in paragraph 2 and late in the story without added pressure, reading as a token callback. The final third includes minor expository summary ("The gap between knowing and understanding had finally closed. She was free.") that could trust the image more, but clarity and momentum remain intact throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines loop or paraphrase: "back when the arcade still had prizes worth winning, back when he still believed" repeats structure without added pressure; "the weight of disputed letters pressing against his ribs like a secret he couldn't deliver" and later "the weight of the letters suddenly heavier" recycle the weight motif without escalation. Stock metaphors ("cutting through the twilight like a knife," "bleeding into the paper like a bruise") and register drift ("the closest thing he had to family," "the kind of defiance that came from knowing") flatten immediacy in peak beats. No loops touch the closure image directly, limiting deduction under the artifact cap. Clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or atmosphere. Two minor paraphrase loops: "silence not an absence but a language" echoed by "sang for the silence itself"; "wind bells chimed" recurs three times with minimal reweighting. No template cadence or filter stacks. Figurative language is dense ("shroud," "smoke whip," "streak of color") but mostly coherent; "whip of smoke" for the ringmaster briefly strains. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies well; figurative density is high ("scent that clung to the shelves like the last whisper of a forgotten dream") but mostly legible. Two artifacts lower the score: "The library itself was a scientific poetry library" is a paraphrase loop (library/library), and "the place where stories lived, where time unraveled and reformed like threads in a loom" stacks abstract clauses without concrete action, dulling momentum in a high-concept beat. Dialogue mechanics are clean; sentence openings vary. Information density is solid overall.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, and information density is high (most lines advance image, character, or pressure). Metaphors are mostly coherent ("liquid amber," "echo of her presence") though "books whispered secrets" and "colors seemed to hum" edge toward stock figurative language in the opening. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity is maintained throughout. The phrase "whispering archipelago" and "hush of improbable beginnings" repeat the concept without adding pressure, a minor density slip. Propulsion is clean, grammar tight, and the final line's syntax ("Not yet...But I will") effectively recasts expectation. No artifacts touch closure; reaches low-7s on craft with minor figurative redundancy in setup.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    Rhythm varies; no severe template cadence. Information density is moderate—sentences often layer action and atmosphere. Minor loops: "The locksmith understood" echoes "The locksmith did" within close range; "not just any story—it was the truth" is near-paraphrase. Figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching: "secrets coiled like smoke," "light pooling like mercury," "hush of cosmic possibility" in quick succession. The closure beat is clean and imagistic. Deduct −0.3 for mild loops and metaphor density, preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies appropriately and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or causality. The memory-surge paragraph shows strong propulsion: "the weight of a small body in his arms, the metallic tang of blood in his mouth, the desperate whisper of a voice he couldn't place." However, minor scaffold appears: "Elias had spent years trying to recover those stolen memories, poring over old journals, interviewing villagers" lists actions without embodied texture, and the phrase "the way it seemed to hum" / "the way they were broken" repeats the same stem construction. A paraphrase loop in the opening ("It wasn't just the mushroom's eerie luminescence... it was the way it seemed to hum") restates awe without adding pressure. These artifacts do not obscure closure but prevent entry into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is largely clean with strong imagery ("spines split like dry lips," "heels clicking against the stone floor like a metronome") and varied rhythm. Information density is high in the opening third. Two issues lower the score: the phrase "by analyzing the geometry of tea leaves, you can predict the shape of shadows" arrives as exposition rather than dramatized discovery, flattening momentum, and "the combative tenderness in her chest flared" repeats the tone label rather than embodying it through fresh gesture. No template cadence or loop artifacts; figurative language remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied, and information density is high in beats like the seed description and the travelers' emergence. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence—"silver thread," "braille," "rubies," "needle," "tapestry," "wind chimes," "cathedral"—without teaching a pattern or paying off with coherent closure linkage, triggering the overwriting density check (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: the song is "the thread, the seed the needle, and the world beyond the veil the tapestry," but threads do not weave tapestries with needles in textile work; the vehicle contradicts itself (−0.4). Register drift into elevated diction ("succor," "insatiably," "essences," "radiant hush") feels consistent with voice but strains plausibility for a pruner's lived lexicon in peak moments (−0.3). No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and syntax varies purposefully. Clarity is mostly maintained despite density.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level clarity is strong with vivid, purposeful images (fireflies, threads drinking light, knots writhing). Some overwriting in the opening: "shimmered," "alive with," "danced like trapped fireflies" stacks metaphor without strict need. Minor scaffold in adjacent lines: "The mask was its vessel. And the restless spirits it held? They were not at peace, but *grounded*" repeats the concept with synonym churn. The italicized technical terms (*accumulated silence*, *interlaced hush*, *grounded*, *exhume*) feel like prompt artifacts signaling required elements rather than organic diction. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; rhythm varies and propulsion remains steady.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and imagistically strong ("rain-scoured frescoes," "darkness so complete it seemed to swallow sound"). However, three artifacts lower the score: (1) paraphrase loop in paragraph 2 ("pieced together the truth…from their silence" restates "interpret silence"), (2) mild overwriting in the closure paragraph ("living thing, thick and suffocating"), and (3) the final sentence's direct thematic statement reduces propulsion. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual momentum. Information density is high—every line advances. Figurative language ("bone dust," "ink in water") is vivid and coherent. No loops or scaffold detected. Grammar and sequencing are clean. Minor cluster: "The biplane inside was no longer frozen; it spiraled upward, the snow swirling in a vortex. Liora's voice, when it came, was the crackle of an old radio" stacks three short beats in quick succession without causal linkage, creating a slight stutter at a peak moment. Overall propulsion is strong and clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high in the graffiti and bolt-plate beats. However, mild loops appear: "The ghost—if that's what it was—reached out" echoes prior descriptions without adding pressure, and "Elias understood then" + "He pressed it into the ghost's palm" form a small template run. The phrase "some ghosts, he knew, would always be listening" in the final paragraph edges toward abstraction rather than image. No major artifacts touch closure, but these slips prevent entry to the 8+ band. Clarity and propulsion remain strong overall, with figurative language (mist as living thing, notes golden and trembling) mostly purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity is generally strong, with good sentence variety and momentum through most beats. However, line-level issues accumulate: paraphrase loops ("She had come here seeking answers, but now she wondered if she was intruding on something sacred" after the prior beat already established this); template cadence in the opening elevator sequence; and stock phrasing ("heart ache," "breath caught," "eyes flickered"). The phrase "joy beneath anguish" repeats without variation across three uses. The climactic beat where Lira deciphers the diary is clean and propulsive, limiting closure damage.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is dense and imagistic with strong rhythm ("bruised nimbus as lingering sorrow," "bones settling"). Some overwriting: "the quiet was explosive here, a pressure building behind the silence, like the moment before a storm breaks" stacks three metaphors for the same idea. Paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "The string had broken" is explained, then re-explained as "the thread of something deeper." Minor template cadence in paragraph four: "Once, it had shown...Another time, it had captured" uses identical stems. Figurative density is high but mostly lands. The final image "let the wind carry him forward" is clear and propulsive, escaping the preceding reflective weight.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clear with purposeful rhythm, but template cadence appears in the opening third: "She had come for… She had come to…" and repeated "Liora had" stems. Several lines loop: the opening's "not in the way others did" echoes "negative air where a jawline met a throat, the fleeting shadow…" without added pressure. The sketch description ("not just blue… not just still") uses the not-just/but parallelism effectively but borders on pattern-stack. Filter verbs ("seemed to breathe") appear but remain voice-motivated. Information density is high; no major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create visual momentum. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Clarity is strong; spatial choreography and action sequences are easy to follow. Weakness: a few scaffold phrases ("a prickle down his spine," "His breath hitched") rely on stock embodiment rather than fresh specificity. The "sharp eyes studying" and "rare smile tugging" construction feels slightly template. No paraphrase loops or major redundancy, but heightened beats could benefit from tighter, more idiosyncratic imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose maintains momentum through the hall of mirrors sequence. However, recurrent phrases and template cadence appear: "Elias had…" openers repeat across paragraphs, and "The gears…" "The mirrors…" "The prophecies…" create a formulaic pattern. Stock metaphors ("metallic whispers," "captured sunlight," "hauntingly bright") cluster without fresh specificity. Information density is moderate; many sentences do atmospheric work without advancing causality. No major loops or clarity breaks, but pervasive decorative language and minor scaffold (e.g., "He understood now," "Elias realized now") dull line-level propulsion. Applying −0.6 for template cadence and stock metaphor spread; −0.2 for scaffold stems.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied. No major loops or artifacts obscure causality. However, several beats rely on stock phrasing: "a riot of color," "a chorus of thanks," "glow brighter than the nebula." The final paragraph stacks summary moves ("The butterflies returned first, then the trees bloomed") that compress pivotal transformation into list-like telling. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance atmosphere without tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is mostly strong: varied syntax, clear action order, high information density in key beats. However, mild paraphrase loops appear ("The doomsday clock ticked once, then stopped" / "The doomsday clock's hands dissolved") and filter stacks cluster in reflective passages ("had kept it, though he couldn't say why" / "didn't know if the world would end"). Figurative language is dense but occasionally strained ("bruised awe filling the air, thick as salt"). The opening and closing lines anchor well. Minor scaffold ("Now, as dusk bled") and one conceptual restatement ("quiet, like a held hand, like a promise" after "quiet") nudge the score down without breaking momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and most sentences advance story or atmosphere, but some phrasing edges toward the decorative: "clung to the cliff's edge like a beggar's grip" and "swallowed by the earth or the birds' hunger" are vivid yet slightly overwritten for the urgency. Information density is high in action beats (nut-scattering, man's escape) but the opening two paragraphs carry more setup than pressure. No loops or scaffolding; grammar and sequence are clean. The final line ("branches heavy with fruit that would never be eaten") recharges the opening image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies appropriately, and sentences generally advance. However, template cadence appears in the middle: "She had spent... She had found... She had come... She thought... She remembered... She pulled..." clusters "She [past perfect/simple past]" stems across six consecutive paragraph openings, flattening momentum. Mixed metaphor: "cacophony of regrets" jars against the established symphony motif. The final "They were a map" lands cleanly, but earlier scaffolding ("The pieces fell into place like a puzzle") is generic.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.6)
    Line-level clarity is mostly clean, but figurative density is high without payoff: "like seeds tossed into the wind," "like a secret too heavy to keep," "like smoke." Paraphrase loop in the middle: "things appeared and disappeared, not because they were lost, but because they were still being decided" restates the library's flux without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in opener: "The air smelled…" "Elias exhaled…" "He had incised…" three consecutive subject-verb stems (−0.4). Artifacts total −0.6, and elevated diction at closure ("parole," "prismatic," "androgynous figure with ink-stained fingers") drifts from scene urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.9)
    Imagery is vivid and specific ("adobe walls slick with the first rain in a decade," "hungry mouth," "coating her tongue with the taste of salt and regret"). Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is generally strong. However, several loops and scaffold lines appear: "She could taste the rain's memory" is immediately restated as sensory detail; "His name was Kael, and his sorrow was emotionally contagious" front-loads exposition that could emerge through action; "The pavilion's entrance was half-buried, the coral's edges worn smooth" is followed by "Maren knelt, pressing her palm to the ground" without clear transition. The phrase "sturdy brittle" is repeated identically in two separate sentences, once as wall descriptor and once as voice quality. "Thick as syrup" and "grow teeth and claws" are competent but stock metaphors. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits deduction to −0.8 for these combined issues.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no major loops or scaffold clutter. "The weight of the cuckoo clock in her satchel thudding softly" is concrete and propulsive. Clarity is high throughout. Minor density lapses: "her empathetic decisiveness guiding her next move" is label-only, and "the hush of borrowed starlight" recurs as poetic filler without fresh work. The weeks-pass summary compresses key dramatizable material. The final paragraph's "empathetic decisiveness" label in the clock reappears without earned specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong, but several passages loop or paraphrase: "The fractures were part of the story now, part of the memory. To erase them would be to erase the woman entirely" restates the same idea across two sentences without added pressure. The opening's "helix-minded precision flickering between obsession and despair" is never concretely demonstrated on the page. Stock phrasing appears in peak beats—"her breath hitched," "her own certainty wavering"—and the final image ("her heart a quaking reverie") relies on poetic assertion rather than a concrete sensory anchor. Template cadence in the woman-in-the-mirror beat (three consecutive "she had" constructions) flattens rhythm. Figurative density is high ("shadows stretching like fingers," "moonlight into jagged constellations," "memories bled into objects") without always serving scene pressure, approaching overwriting in aggregate. Apply −0.6 for loops and stock beats, −0.4 for template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, metaphor saturation in high-pressure beats ("prism-minded," "latent blaze," "threshold effects," "seeds of vigilance") tilts ornamental; "inverted gravity" and "refracting light into prismatic shards" stack without advancing causality in the climax paragraph. Paraphrase loop: "The grotto groaned, the inverted gravity shuddering" / "The world would right itself soon" restates time pressure. Template cadence in middle beats: "She traced… She had spent… She understood…" runs three consecutive stems. No clarity break at closure, but density exceeds purpose in peak moments. Deduct −0.6 for figurative saturation and template stems, plus −0.2 for paraphrase loop.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("stress cracks spiderwebbing," "ghost of [sound]"), but some figurative density appears without full payoff: "tree-songs," "the world's quiet," "empathy in motion" cluster in early paragraphs. "Symphonically minded mind" is a minor redundancy. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and clarity remains high. No loops or scaffolding mar momentum. The final third sustains propulsion, though the elevated register occasionally prioritizes texture over compression.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is steady through the nexus sequence. Information density is solid; most lines do double work. Minor scaffold appears: "He had been an exiled chess tutor for seven years now" front-loads backstory, and "testament to resilience" edges toward abstract summary. The metaphor "like ink in water" for magnetic currents is apt, but "the heartbeat of the earth itself" is stock. No loops or severe artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the grade above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythm, high information density, and no paraphrase loops. Figurative language ("wires snaking like veins," "air itself seemed to shimmer") is purposeful and controlled. The opening line establishes atmosphere and stakes; the closing firework image charges the resolution. Minor friction: "the path to empathy…was paved with patience and the right frequency" skirts abstraction, and "weary, almost reverent" is a stock pairing. One small template cadence in the tuning sequence ("too low…higher, higher") but it serves propulsion. No clarity loss at closure; prose supports pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Figurative language is frequent ("swayed like a drowsy cat," "her ambition a quiet fire," "wind through the reeds") but generally controlled and coherent. However, several metaphors cluster densely without added pressure ("the turning of the tide's thought" is abstract and opaque on first encounter; "wildflower hush" is atmospheric but vague). The phrase "revealing the interior of the wrapping paper—a habit she'd inherited" is awkward and grammatically ambiguous (the habit is doodling, not revealing). Minor paraphrase loop: "her ambition a quiet fire that burned brighter" and "Mira's breath caught as she flipped through the pages" recycle intensity markers without new detail. No severe artifacts, but cumulative figurative density in the opening third slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and supports the accumulative design, with longer descriptive sentences in early beats and shorter ones as the tremor hits. Information density is high—nearly every line advances setting, character perception, or thematic freight. However, a few phrases skirt purple territory: "whirling silence," "gravity's fickle dance," and "like stars" in the final image feel slightly ornamental rather than sharp. The metaphor "like a key" for the arrow tip is set up but never mechanically paid off, which is appropriate, yet the line "wrapping around her like a second skin" during the echo moment is a stock metaphor that dulls immediacy. No loops or template cadence appear, and clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory details are sharp ("edges curled from exposure," "joint popping under strain"). Information density is high in the opening third. However, several beats carry paraphrase loops: "The containers were alive. Not literally, of course, but something was using them, reshaping them, turning the port into a machine" restates the same idea across three clauses without added pressure. The phrase "foresight in action" recurs as scaffold. The final paragraph's exposition ("The world didn't just break; it reinvented itself") tells theme rather than trusting the image. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase and scaffold in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and momentum are strong; sentences advance image and action without scaffolding. Figurative density is high throughout ("indigo bloomed into the air, curling around her like smoke," "aurora flared, its colors merging into a single, brilliant beam") but remains coherent. Template stems appear in the chisel-strike sequence ("the chisel struck again, and the indigo shattered… the chisel struck a third time, and the pink note dissolved") and minor paraphrase loops recur ("the colors were muted" / "the aurora was restless"), triggering a cumulative −0.4 deduction in Q7 for pattern artifacts that do not obscure closure but dull peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally clean with purposeful imagery ("like heat distorts the horizon," "smoke-like form"), but several phrases loop or restate: "avalanchingly quiet stillness" and "echoing silence deepened into something heavier, something that hummed" paraphrase atmospheric density twice. "The silence of the canyon returned, but it was no longer avalanchingly quiet—it was the quiet of a held breath finally released" recycles the opening's "held breath" motif without adding new pressure. Filter-verb use is light. No major artifacts obscure causality, but the closure beat carries some redundancy that slightly dulls its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, and figurative language is dense: "gaps like missing teeth in the cosmos," "love was a parabola and despair a descending asymptote," "equation that looked like a predator's grin." Clarity holds except where metaphoric vehicles pile without causal linkage (e.g., "transposed empathy" anchors ribs "like barnacles" adjacent to "variables refusing to hold still"). Paraphrase loop detected: paragraph 3 restates Elias's motivation ("to understand the mathematics of emotion") in adjacent sentences without added pressure. Artifact: "deliberate ambiguity was his method—he never explained, never clarified, because to name a thing was to kill it" reads as thematic summary mid-beat rather than dramatized action, stalling momentum. Filter-verb reliance ("He didn't know," "she said," "he wore") is moderate and voice-motivated, not stacked heavily in peak beats. Information density is uneven: the ∂f/∂t equation and halo fragment carry specificity, but the borrowed voices cycle through atmospheric metaphor without tightening the physical plot.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "the weight of its silence pressed harder," "settled into her bones, heavier than the relic," "in the marrow of her bones" (repeated metaphor within lines). The phrase "the space between knowing and feeling" and "the fade from memory to myth" edge toward abstraction without concrete grounding. Minor paraphrase loop: "the pendant vibrated sympathetically" followed immediately by "its wings trembling as if alive." Sentence openings vary and proofreading is clean, but figurative density occasionally blurs momentum in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically controlled; sentence openings vary and no loops or scaffold appear. Information density is strong in early paragraphs. However, figurative language becomes dense in the final third without pattern-teaching: "truthful lies," "shifted hush," "quiet fabric" cluster without sharpening the closure image. The line "The frost did not lie, but it did not speak plainly either" is elegant but borders on overwriting for a high-pressure beat. Minor register drift ("residual energy," "dendritic veins") pulls slightly away from Elias's embodied experience. No major artifacts touch closure, but density in the final moves reduces propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every paragraph without clear payoff: "silence was raveling," "threads still damp with her own breath," "the hush of time's unraveling tapestry." These metaphors layer without progressing pressure, creating density that obscures rather than sharpens. Template cadence appears in opening stems: "She had spent decades," "She had not left," "She thought of the loom." Paraphrase loops: the orchard "forgetting itself" is restated in multiple forms without added information. The closure beat—"the silence was no longer a weight. It was a beginning"—remains abstract rather than concrete image. Apply −1.2 for patterned artifacts (metaphor saturation, template stems, loops).

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean with strong imagery ("hummed when struck just right," "vein of azure defiance stitching the wound shut") and varied sentence rhythm. Information density is high in the mine sequence. Minor loops: "dying" and "weary of bearing fruit" restate in adjacent lines; "drip of water" / "groaned around him" / "breath ragged" cluster stock embodiment phrases during peak action. The final paragraph ("The meek blacksmith...") uses template summary rather than a charged image to close, dulling propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, opening with vivid anchors ("ozone and rust") and tightening during the climax. Information density is high—every paragraph advances setting, character, or concept. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs are evident; "cyclically spontaneous" and "nexus" are voice-motivated. Minor scaffold appears in transitions ("Kael exhaled," "Kael swallowed") but doesn't flatten momentum. Figurative language ("sky bled violet," "air thick with murmur") is purposeful and tied to POV. The final beat's withholding ("Kael made his decision") is a structural choice, not a line-level flaw, but it creates slight opacity. Zero substantive artifacts touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines advance image, character, or pressure. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, several phrases loop: "the dark" appears four times in peak beats without reweighting; "luminescent ache" and "ghost of light" overlap; "protect" recurs without escalation. The phrase "like a lantern from hand to hand" in the penultimate paragraph feels like explanatory scaffold. No major clarity issues, but these micro-loops dull propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with strong imagery (blade of bottled lightning, roots into the dark). Minor artifacts include paraphrase loops ("not quite memories, not quite dreams" / "dreams were the first drafts of dawn"), a template opening stem ("Once, she had been…"), and filter-verb stacks in reflective passages ("knew better than," "had learned long ago"). These do not obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats, applying a −0.6 deduction within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language (heron stilts, sleeping giant valley, breathing wing) is vivid and coherent. Information density is high in setting description. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Some people are like that too" echoes "Some people magnetize stories because they're like this"; the morpho's "warning that was also an invitation" and "come closer, but not too close" restate the same idea. Template cadence in exposition ("He had spent the winter tracking... watching how...") slightly dulls momentum. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentences do multiple jobs ("Not in words—never in words—but in the way they leaned"). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent except "moonlight…pooling…like mercury" followed by "warmth…not the heat of the sun, but something older"—mixed sensory metaphors. Minor loops: "the tower no longer felt like a prison. It was a vessel" restates without added pressure. "Click" of the pin recurs without clear payoff. No major artifacts touch closure, but density occasionally tips toward ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent (mica windows, alchemical trees, threads of light). Template cadence appears in the greenhouse tour: "She led... The keeper explained... She pressed... She gestured" across four consecutive paragraphs. Paraphrase loop: "not in threat, but in greeting, as if they recognized" over-explains the vines' intention. The closing paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the keeper's dissolution, and "one song at a time" is a stock closer. Density is present but momentum sags under decorative layering.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; nearly every line advances character or atmosphere. Clarity is excellent, and spatial choreography (desk → paradox section → door) tracks cleanly. Minor scaffold: "He had built his life on the principle of staying while leaving" and the subsequent unpacking feel slightly expository mid-scene. The phrase "enlarged tranquility" in the penultimate paragraph is striking but semantically muddy—tranquility enlarged by what mechanism? No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language (origami, sigh) is apt but clusters in reflective beats without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies, information density is high, and no paraphrase loops appear. Figurative language ("ghost of something he couldn't name," "steam curling like a question") is purposeful and fresh. Minor register drift: "heuristically gentle" in the woman's introduction feels slightly imposed rather than earned by her speech or action, though it does not obscure causality. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence or scaffold. Propulsion is steady, with strategic telling compressing transit between bakery and courtyard.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clean, but several phrases recur or paraphrase without adding pressure: "quartz hush" appears twice, "gently meticulous" echoes in the opening and closing, and "fading to memory" / "illusions fading to memory" forms a near-loop. The figurative language is controlled, though "spectral glow," "luminous and fleeting," and "shadows stretched" cluster in the middle section without distinct payoff. No major artifacts obscure causality, but density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and propulsion is strong in the confrontation. Figurative language is controlled ("the pier groaned," "wavering fingers across the water"). Minor loop: "the sound of trust breaking" appears three times with near-identical phrasing (setup, middle, end), creating slight synonym churn. Template cadence in the false-start sequence ("The first false start… The second came…") is functional but mechanical. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically varied; opening and closing images anchor voice and atmosphere. Information density is high in the forest-election and aurora descriptions. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "She'd scoffed at the time, but now...she wondered" echoes a template stem, and "He didn't seem surprised to see her" followed by his immediate knowledge of her reads as minor scaffold. No artifact touches closure directly, so cap non-closure debt at −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is generally purposeful ("laughter slithered," "silence felt thicker"). Minor scaffold appears: "He knew then" and "He knew what he had to do" are syntactic echoes that dull propulsion. The phrase "the laughter was different. It wasn't a face. It was a voice without a source" loops the same idea across adjacent sentences. No major artifacts touch closure, so non-closure deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity is solid and spatial sequencing tracks, but several beats show template cadence: "She had heard stories... She had never believed them—until now" and "She had no memory... yet something about the fragment tugged at her." Figurative language in the opening ("sky the color of old bruises," "dried blood") establishes tone but borders on stock. Information density is moderate; some lines (the oasis backstory paragraph) slow momentum without advancing immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally, information density is high, and clarity is strong. Sentence openings vary; paragraphs create visual rhythm. Minor loop detected: "The sculpture sang. Not a melody, not quite, but a resonance..." restates the idea without advancing pressure (−0.2). Some figurative language clusters in the bluff opening paragraph without clear payoff until later, creating mild density without immediate causal work. No major artifacts touch closure, and the final image is propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. Sentence rhythm varies and accelerates during the burn. However, **multiple paraphrase loops and template-stem runs appear**: "The static in his mind" opens three sentences; "The roses were gone, but the farm was still alive, the chaos contained, the static resolved" stacks near-synonyms without added pressure; "He had been built to remember, but his memories were..." and similar constructions recur. Filter-verb stacks ("he remembered," "he watched," "he understood") cluster in reflective beats. These artifacts dull immediacy and trigger **−0.7 in Q7** per the patterned-artifact penalty pack. No figurative muddle or clarity break at closure; the final kneeling image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.6)
    Opening and closing lines are strong; "honey, thick and golden" and "sandstorm calm" offer textured imagery. However, several beats suffer from template cadence and overwriting: "Not just any locket—this one was aged" front-loads emphasis artificially, and "She had been drawn here by the locket" / "The mystery began with the mailbox" use parallel stems that flatten momentum. The phrase "quiet healing" in the penultimate paragraph summarizes rather than trusts the image. Figurative density ("pooling in the cracks," "web of families," "fallen leaves") is high but mostly coherent; one mixed vehicle appears in "sandstorm calm" paired with "honey" dawn, which tonally clash. Information density is solid; no major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled: "groaning like a dying beast," "weight of secrets," "spider spins its web as both trap and home." Minor loop: two consecutive paragraphs open with "She [verb]" structures and "realized/understood then" appears twice within three paragraphs, a faint scaffold pattern. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Information density is high; nearly every sentence adds image or stakes. The closure beat ("closed her journal, the dice safe in her pocket") is clean but leans toward summary rather than immediate action that propels the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., wildflowers anchor grief and sister's letter and the whale's timing). Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. However, a few figurative choices border on ornamental ("gleaming silence," "salt and the sea") without adding pressure. The final paragraph risks slight overwriting ("silent, searching beams," "scattered stars") that doesn't obscure but doesn't sharpen. Clarity and momentum remain strong. Proofreading is clean. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.4)
    Heavy overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or abstraction ("tranquil blaze," "smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic hum," "darkest light"). Paraphrase loops pervade—paragraphs 2 and 3 restate the prophecy's wound without advancing pressure; final paragraphs cycle "he had come to hush" and variants. Template cadence: "The summoner [verb]" opens multiple successive paragraphs. Register drifts into poetic abstraction inconsistent with a focalizer under stress, and figurative density in peak beats ("tranquil blaze burned… not the kind that consumed, but the kind that illuminated without heat") obscures rather than sharpens. Multiple artifacts touch the closure section, triggering the global 9+ disallow and high-band caps per Q7 patterned-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally clean and propulsive with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors. Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances character, world, or stakes. Minor issues: "the whisper of falling stars" is slightly generic, and "her voice patiently nimble" mixes metaphor oddly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The line "the weight of the past finally lifting into something new" borders on abstraction but does not obscure causality. Overall, line-level craft supports momentum without significant drag.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and clarity is generally strong, but several artifacts dull momentum: "charmed skeptic," "tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve" read as label-only traits rather than embodied descriptors. The closure beat ("The quarantine was over. Not because the world had changed, but because Elias had") tells rather than shows the transformation. Paraphrase loop: "translate isolation into independence" and the final summary feel like synonym churn around the same concept. Figurative language is vivid (light through stained glass, frost on glass) but density in the final third drops into scaffold-like summation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and the opening/closing images anchor effectively. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "It was the only thing her father had left her" / "Proof that her family had once been loyal, that their treason had been calibrated" restate rather than advance; "unlinking herself from the past, from the girl who had believed" is near-synonym churn. "The key had no lock because the door was never meant to be opened—only passed through" is metaphorically muddy (a door one passes through is opened). Stock metaphor strings ("smooth as poisoned honey," "sound like cracking ice") and filter-verb stacks in reflective passages dull immediacy. These artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce propulsion in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is adequate; spatial choreography tracks. Repetitive phrasing appears: "she knew / she was certain / she understood" cycles across paragraphs, and "The shell was / The shell had / The shell in her hand" loops without added pressure. Figurative language ("coiled like frozen serpents," "thread, weaving through the webs") is vivid but occasionally mixed. Information density is moderate; several lines paraphrase prior beats. Propulsion slows mid-story during exposition but recovers at the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and most sentences advance; no major loops or template runs. However, several lines carry ornamental figuration without causal work: "ancient breath whispering back," "truth woven carefully into her bones," and the snow globe's tear "catching the light" are atmospheric but not informationally dense. The phrase "weaves truth carefully, never rushing, never assuming" interrupts momentum with authorial aside rather than grounding in action. A minor paraphrase loop appears: "The dead didn't speak in words. They spoke in symbols" restates without added pressure. These keep the piece in mid-6s despite generally clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and read-aloud flow is generally strong. Information density is adequate; most lines do double duty (action + atmosphere). However, mild loops appear: "the hidden effort in all things" is restated twice within close proximity, and "patterns" recurs as a thematic stem without added pressure. The final paragraph stacks three parallel clauses ("the fireflies danced, the moon paths stretched on, and for the first time…") in a slightly template cadence. No severe artifacts touch closure, but cumulative repetition and stock metaphors ("quiet flame") lower precision.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentences vary in rhythm and opening. Some strong images ("nest of torn paper lay scattered like confetti"). Paraphrase loop appears: "The diamond wasn't cursed—it was a tool" followed by "It's not cursed... It's a lens" restates the same idea. Template cadence in early paragraphs: "He crouched... Elias exhaled... Hours passed as he pieced..." Minor clarity issue: "his body tensing" in high-pressure moment could be more specific. Information density is adequate; no major scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies, imagery is vivid ("fingers of a drowning man," "moths to a flame"), and information density is high in the opening third. Paraphrase loops appear: "He had spent thirty years listening… convinced that the fragments… could unfold the future" then "he had always known it" without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative language in most lines of the storm descent ("the wind howled… beneath it, he heard the fragments… overlapping, colliding") without pattern-teaching or direct payoff (−0.4). No major scaffold or register drift; the final paragraph summarizes rather than propels.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—each paragraph advances character, atmosphere, or action. No paraphrase loops, synonym churn, or template cadence runs. Metaphors are clear and consistent ("breath held too long," "smoke," "chorus of ghosts"). The Overwriting Check passes: figurative language appears frequently but remains coherent and voice-motivated. Zero scaffold or artifact debris. Prose is clean, propulsive, and legible throughout, with no drag at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, figurative language clusters densely in the opening paragraphs ("drift-ice marina groaned," "wooden piers creaking like old bones," "frost settled into their cracks," "breath curling") without all images doing double duty. A paraphrase loop appears mid-story: "The artifact wasn't just dangerous; it was *alive*" followed immediately by "its vibrations attuned to the guilt"—the second line restates rather than advances. Template cadence in action sequences: "Elias sprinted…Elias lunged…Elias closed his eyes…Elias pulled" shows repetitive subject-verb stems. Minor clarity slip: "blood trickling from her ears" introduces a new physical consequence without prior cue.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and several images are strong ("jagged crown," "moon hung low and swollen, its reflection fractured"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "The revolution was not a shout; it was a whisper" immediately follows "some things could not be forced, could not be rushed," recycling the same patience-versus-urgency content. Template cadence emerges in the final third: "The revolution would not come… it would come…" Figurative density is high without muddle, but the loops and conceptual redundancy in adjacent lines trigger −0.6 in Q7 per the artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and momentum are steady; no major loops. Minor artifacts: "His pulse quickened" and "his heart pounding" are generic embodiment; "the lantern's flame flared, as if reacting to his fear" mixes metaphor (flame reacts to emotion). The phrase "its presence a reminder of the past's grip on the present" summarizes rather than shows. Sentence rhythm varies adequately. The final line "The light flickered, steady and sure, as he stepped forward" is on-theme but lacks concrete specificity to charge the image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clean with varied sentence rhythm and strong concrete nouns (copper gears, spider legs, metronome). However, several figurative constructions feel strained: "brass frames catching light like broken promises" mixes vehicle and tenor awkwardly, and "coiled in his chest, tight and unyielding, like the gears" is a paraphrase loop. The phrase "vibrant hush" in dialogue attribution introduces register drift. No major loops or scaffold, but metaphor density in the opening and closing paragraphs occasionally slows momentum without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but several line-level issues accumulate: "steadily curious" and "throughout the evolution" are register-drift phrases that jar against the voice; "the workshop groaned... its iron bones creaking" and "the workshop was dying" loop the same concept; "spitting into a bucket of acid that hissed" feels like ornamental specificity without pressure payoff. The phrase "transliterated through the flickering images in a kaleidoscope" is abstract where concrete mechanics would serve. Clarity at closure holds, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentences vary in rhythm, and opening/closing images anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high—most lines advance mystery or character—but scaffold phrases recur: "the truth was," "she needed to know," "it all made sense now" function as expository hinges rather than scene texture. Template cadence appears in the numbers-listing paragraph ("In timestamps, in user IDs, even in…"), which stalls momentum. No major loops or filter-verb stacks, and technical detail (server logs, metadata) reads plausible. Figurative language (digital graveyard, static, echoes) remains coherent but leans decorative in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.7)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("clawing at the frigid air like skeletal fingers," "time seemed to thicken like molasses," "beam cutting through the dark like a blade"), creating register drift and rhythmic monotony without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loops appear: "shifting ice floes" and "ice floes below were not just shifting, but *moving*" restate the same idea. Template cadence in the middle beats ("He pressed…," "He turned…," "He didn't hesitate") flattens propulsion. The phrase "weighted silence before reply" and "as if the world itself had taken a breath before reply" bracket the story but their function is unclear, reading as ornamental recurrence rather than causal or thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in key beats: the man's breath as "wet rattle…pebbles dragged across a frozen shore" does double duty (sound and image). Minor scaffold: "He realized then that he had come here to learn…but what he had found instead" is slightly expository where the image could carry alone. No loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the final paragraph integrates salt, ice, and the clipboard without padding.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language (amber pavilion rippling "like a living thing," silence "a weight") supports atmosphere without overcrowding high-pressure beats. However, the phrase "nurturing intersubjective understanding" in the penultimate paragraph is academic register drift that clashes with the winemaker POV, triggering a −0.4 deduction for peak-beat register mismatch. Minor paraphrase loop: "her heart heavier than the grapes" and later "the weight in her chest" restate emotional burden without added pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively; final image ("as if the earth itself approved") leans toward stock pastoral benediction. Information density is generally high, though some scaffold remains ("she said, and it wasn't a question").

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("skeletal hand," "spider's silk," "thread hummed"). Information density is moderate—many lines do double work (mask symbolism + warmth cue). However, several phrases loop conceptually: "whispers preserved in the grain" / "murmurs of the pavilion" / "echo of wisdom" recur without added pressure. "Weight of unspoken knowledge" and "thick with the weight" within two paragraphs. The phrase "Through peripheral awareness, he caught it" frontloads method when the beat could integrate it into action. Two paraphrase moments (e.g., "conjured clearings appeared, pockets of stillness" restates without advancing). Minor scaffold and synonym churn; no severe artifacts touch closure, but pervasive texture padding prevents higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often lyrical ("dew-kissed petals," "light slanted through broken windows"), but exhibits recurring template patterns: "He had come," "He had spent," "He had learned," "He placed," "He smiled." Multiple sentences open with "The" or "Elias" in close succession, creating a drumbeat cadence. Paraphrase loops appear: the theme of collective healing and the transmutation of pain is restated across paragraphs without added pressure. Figurative language is frequent and largely clear, though "vines that curled like fingers" and "petals of a flower" for photograph arrangement read as stock metaphors. Information density is moderate—many sentences advance atmosphere or theme but do not tighten conflict. The final paragraph summarizes the epiphany rather than dramatizing it, lowering propulsion at closure. No severe opacity, but scaffold and loops accumulate to −0.8 to −1.0 range, landing mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are mostly distinct. Information density is high in action beats (crystal experiments). However, **paraphrase loop** appears: "He had spent years listening to the silence here, learning its rhythms, its secrets" closely echoes "He had spent his life studying the past" three paragraphs later—both summarize dedication without adding pressure (−0.2). **Template cadence** in two paragraphs: "He believed… He had found… He had spent…" and "He placed… He began… The crystal…" (−0.4). "Suspended hush" recurs five times, risking thematic churn. Minor filter-verb reliance ("seemed to") but not clustered enough to trigger the stack penalty. Clarity and propulsion are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structure and vivid images ("fog curled around his ankles," "sculptures melting into the fog like wax"). Information density is high in sensory passages, though some lines paraphrase without adding pressure: "He had come here not to preach, but to listen" is immediately followed by abstract explanation of his curse. Template cadence appears in the driftwood sequence ("One by one, he placed the pieces") and several "He + verb" constructions cluster mid-story. Stock metaphors—"grains of sand through his fingers," "leaves in the wind"—appear without transformation. The closing line "And this time, he wouldn't forget" undercuts prior inevitability with assertion. No major loops or artifacts that obscure causality, but figurative density in the first third ("ghostly figures," "static silence," "slow unraveling of rope") risks overwriting without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings shift appropriately. Information density is generally high, though some lines paraphrase without adding pressure: "The station lurched violently, sending tools clattering" followed by "Elias clutched the photograph, knowing it was time to leave" rehearses the urgency without new stakes. Template cadence appears in the second-to-last paragraph ("The last thing he saw... a silent witness to...") with filter-stack phrasing. Figurative language is frequent ("streak of light so bright it burned through the paper," "luminous ache," "wheel of potential") but mostly coherent; one mixed vehicle: "foundations shook... a sound like a dying breath" conflates tactile and auditory in a slightly muddy way. No loops or major scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high (each paragraph advances situation, interiority, or motif). The vinyl shard recurs with purposeful compression, and the "pulsing stillness" phrase bookends effectively. However, minor loops appear: "the way" is used five times in Lena's speech about mundane images, creating template cadence in a key beat. The "scent of hope" description front-loads figurative language (lavender, rain, vanilla, "steeped in something gentle") without pattern-teaching or payoff beyond atmosphere. "Decisively kind" is told rather than shown in micro-actions. The final paragraph's "pulsing stillness" reprise works but borders on over-reliance on the opening phrase. These non-closure artifacts accumulate to −0.6 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Minor scaffolding appears: "She exhaled, her fingers tightening" and similar gestural fillers recur without adding pressure. The phrase "wavering shadows on the walls" and "shifting like smoke" are stock figurative moves. The final beat—"The loop was closed"—is clean but declarative. No paraphrase loops or template runs touch the closure, so artifact penalties remain modest. Clarity and propulsion are adequate; the prose does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and many lines do double duty ("the air smelled of damp earth and something older, something that made her skin prickle"). Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She knelt beside... She placed the teeth... She followed it..." clusters identical stems without pattern-teaching (−0.4). "Bloated" for the substitute body is specific; "polished river stones" for eyes is stock. No paraphrase loops, but the phrase "the kind that" recurs three times across the piece without payoff. Overwriting is minimal and figurative language is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clear, rhythmically varied, and free of loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; figurative language is purposeful and mostly legible. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or quest. The phrase "reflectively vibrant" is register-odd for sea glass (vibrant implies color intensity, not reflective property), a minor coherence slip. No template cadence, no paraphrase loops, no text artifacts. The line-level control under pressure is strong, with concise propulsion through the grotto descent and pearl retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies well, with longer sentences in the opening frame and shorter pulses during the confrontation. Information density is high: most lines advance character, setting, or pressure. Minor template-cadence issue in paragraph two's structure ("it was the way...as if...as if") and slight paraphrase loop between "honeyed" descriptor uses. The final paragraph's "unraveling like the thawing icicles above, leaving behind something new, something alive" stacks metaphors without full coherence (icicles thaw/melt; they don't leave things behind in the way tension does). No major scaffold, but these small slips prevent entry to the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sensory detail is vivid and selective ("mist curled... like a living thing," "hollow chambers echoing"). Two paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "This was how it worked... through ephemeral cameo appearances" immediately followed by "This was the problem with hope... it was never just one thing"; and "the shapes of different hopes" is restated without adding pressure. Template-cadence run in the boy encounter: "the boy asked... Elias shook... The boy's face fell... he, too, faded" (four consecutive stems). Information density is high elsewhere; these artifacts lower the score from 7.5 to 6.9.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("leaves still furled tight as a newborn's fist," "like the echo of a lullaby"). Information density is high in the opening third. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "The villagers had stopped singing…stopped leaving offerings…stopped believing" and "the tendril pulsed" recurs without added nuance. The penultimate paragraph lists future events in summary ("They would scoff…the arbor would hum…the tendrils would creep…they would sing") rather than dramatizing, which flattens momentum. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks, but the future-tense forecast reads as scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the scene's stillness without algorithmic patterning. Information density is high in the object-arrangement beat and the origami-folding sequence. Minor loop detected: "the way a person's breath could shape the air, the way their steps could wear a path" recycles syntactic stem within one reflective passage (−0.2). No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. The closure image is clear and propulsive. Figurative language ("silence was a living thing," "amber of the artist's ink") is coherent and does not muddle peak beats. Minimal scaffold; no paraphrase loops across adjacent lines.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clarity is high; spatial choreography and temporal flow are clean. Several near-paraphrase loops appear: "the harvest of echoes" is defined, then restated as metaphor in the following paragraph; "The timer was his first attempt" and "The mechanism was broken" restate without adding pressure. Template cadence is visible in parallel "He had…" constructions across paragraphs 5–7. Figurative language is dense ("liquid gold," "fireflies," "smoke") but mostly coherent; "wounded season" and "teeth sank in" mix vehicle slightly. No clarity break at closure, so deductions stay within the non-closure cap. Information density is moderate; some scaffolding ("He believed," "He understood then") could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is lyric and image-dense, with strong specificity ("grooves of the kerosene lamp burner," "shadows stretched boundary-lessly trapped"). Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is consistent with the established voice. However, several lines loop conceptually: "the kind that settled like dust" restates "silence," and "not with smoke, but with something denser" paraphrases the prior sentence's effect. The final third leans on exposition ("she had come too far to turn back," "she had not come to be crushed") that scaffolds meaning rather than letting action carry it. Sentence openings vary, but information density drops in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or the carving act. Rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph lengths create visual breathing room. Two minor issues: "the way the sound filled the silence without demanding anything in return" is slight overwriting (two abstract nouns in succession), and "hauntingly practical" + "rust-hued peace" both lean toward elevated diction that, while voice-consistent, brushes against register drift. The carving sequence is propulsive and clear. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; syntax modulates with scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is textured ("a mirror that refused to hold a single truth," "voice like wind through broken glass") but several passages loop conceptually: "she had come to bargain, but the terms were unclear" followed immediately by "Did she want forgiveness? Absolution?" is paraphrase churn. Paragraph clarity is strong and sentence openings vary, but the closure beat stacks abstract assertions—"the lagoon hummed with stories," "she exhaled… and let the wind carry the weight away"—that reduce propulsion and information density. Minor filter-verb stack in the ghost encounter ("she swallowed," "she admitted," "she asked") dulls immediacy at a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is strong in the water-trail sequence. Minor scaffold: "Mara thought of the terminal's bones, the way the water flowed, the way the sextant had led her here" loops conceptually without adding pressure. "A maze of intentions" and "redirected flows" recur as labels rather than evolving through action. No figurative muddle or template cadence; clarity holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is strong in the workbench and music-box beats. Minor issues: "The city stirred, but the Spire remained quiet, a bubble of stillness" rephrases the sanctuary motif without adding pressure. "He worked in silence, the only sound the soft ticking" pairs "silence" and "sound" awkwardly. The final paragraph leans on summary ("let himself remember") where a concrete image would propel harder. No major loops or template cadence; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies across beats, but several phrases loop conceptually: "the weight of something unspoken" / "the weight of the moment," and "he had spent years chasing" recurs in reflection and closure. Stock metaphors appear ("lanterns flickering like dying stars," "peeling like old skin") without transformation. The sundial and mirror beats carry clarity, yet the final paragraph stacks abstract claims ("serene upheaval," "thoughtfully clear," "architecture of lies") that summarize rather than propel. Template-cadence check: "He had found," "he had learned," "he had trained," "he had spent" stack across paragraphs without causal linkage, reducing density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong sensory anchors. Information density is solid; most lines advance atmosphere or investigation. Two minor issues: "The fog thickened, muffling the world" and "The fog shifted, revealing a sliver" form a repetitive stem pattern across the middle and end. "Infinitely patient" and "secrets waited, infinitely patient" echo without added pressure. No loops or mixed metaphors touch the closure beat, but the paraphrase slightly reduces propulsion in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.1)
    Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "autumn's breath curled… like a sigh too tired to finish" and "grief moved through a person like a river carving stone." One mixed metaphor: "the garden's shadows clung to her like old grief" then later "let them swallow her whole"—clinging and swallowing are contradictory actions that blur the vehicle. Minor paraphrase loop: "She had not meant to steal it" and "when the king's absence was explained" retrace motivation without added pressure. Information density is high; momentum consistent. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies well ("The egg was cold, but he refused to believe it dead" vs. the longer hatching sequence), and figurative language is controlled. Minor scaffolding appears: "That night, as the palace groaned" and "On the third night, he tried again" use identical temporal frames. The phrase "Through the discovery, Kaelen did not move" reads as a seam artifact—"discovery" as a synonym for "hatching" feels externally imposed rather than POV-native. Clarity and propulsion are strong overall, with high information density in the contraption and egg-cracking beats.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity and concision are generally strong; sentence rhythm varies and no major loops appear. However, figurative density is high throughout without escalation ("obsidian lagoon," "kelp-drift peace," "scars could sing," "coin… a beacon," "sand shifted… testament to the earth's resilience")—metaphors accumulate without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing propulsion. The phrase "scars could sing" recurs three times without transformation, approaching template cadence. The final paragraph stacks abstract clauses ("the promise of peace," "what had been and what could still be") that dilute the closure image. No major artifacts touch the ending directly, but density moderates momentum across the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose carries rhythm and vivid imagery ("mouths agape like silent witnesses," "velvet the color of dried violets") but suffers from decorative stacking in non-peak moments. Paraphrase loop: "wrapped in oilcloth and tied with twine" → immediate elaboration on the box's colors feels redundant. Template stems recur: "She was… her mind… her heart…" and "It was… It had…" in adjacent paragraphs. Filter verbs ("let the breadcrumbs lead her") appear but remain voice-motivated. The apparition's "woven from moonlight and echoes" risks purple without grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, purposeful, and rhythmically varied. Information density is high: "The calculating machine gear whirred to life in his hand, its brass teeth spinning in a pattern that approximated infinity" does three jobs (object, attribute, thematic echo) in one line. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor scaffold: "He had spent lifetimes collecting these gears" and "He had spent decades refining it" both open with identical stem and abstract summary rather than concrete anchor. One figurative stumble: "frozen moment of cosmic bloom" mixes temperature and biological metaphor without clear vehicle coherence. Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph structure varies purposefully. No major line-level artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled: "mist clung to the hills like a shroud," "monarchs drifting like embers on the breeze." Information density is high and sentences advance atmosphere and stakes. However, the piece carries template-cadence artifacts (several "He had…" and "Elias had…" stems) and synonym loops ("soft as old paper" / "brittle with time"). The figurative language is dense throughout without pattern-teaching, and phrases like "thundering in its calm" and "quiet alchemy" read as elevated diction that slightly obscures rather than sharpens. These non-closure issues accumulate to −0.8 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is controlled ("jagged teeth biting into the restless sea," "shadow stretched like a gnomon"). Information density is high with purposeful telling that compresses the climb. Two issues lower the score: paraphrase loop in the final paragraph ("The obsidian ridge gleamed behind him, its edges softened by the tide" echoes the opening without added pressure), and stock metaphor "hissed like dying embers" lacks specificity. The line "Not in words—never in words—" is scaffolding that could be cut. Sentence openings vary, no template cadence detected, grammar clean.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is generally clean, but several patterns recur: "The X threads [verb]" template across three consecutive paragraphs (blue, red, gold) creates mechanical cadence. Figurative language appears frequently ("velveteen gloom," "pooling in hollows," "cat at a saucer of milk") without cumulative pressure, trending decorative. The chess-clock phrase and "uncharted echoes" are seeded but not paid off in the closure beat—they remain thematic labels rather than images that constrain or charge the final moment. Information density is moderate; some sentences (e.g., "He hummed as he worked...") add atmosphere but do not advance situation or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is largely clear, but several patterns recur: "She had spent," "She had come," "She had written" stacks past-perfect constructions without variation. The phrase "not by choice, but by necessity" and "not as a prophecy, but as an invitation" repeat the template "not X, but Y" without tonal justification. Figurative language is vivid ("blade of black glass," "liquid sky") but some vehicles—"interlocking ideas" as tower-material—stretch credibility. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat, so deductions remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("fire's glow curled like a sleeping cat," "melody so soft it might have been the wind, if the wind had ever sung," "dust swirled like a tiny storm"), and several metaphors in the final third ("shimmering like a mirage," "liquid gold") verge on overwriting without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loops appear: "The dust remembered. It remembered the stories..." and "this time, the dust would be his voice" echoes prior claims. Template cadence: multiple "The [noun] was [descriptor]" openers and "He [verb]" stems flatten rhythm. Information density is moderate; many lines do atmospheric work without advancing causality, and the closure beat remains description-heavy rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is mostly clean with purposeful rhythm ("beautiful in the way a knife is beautiful") and varied syntax. Two minor issues: the phrase "the warmth lingered" followed immediately by "He exhaled, watching his breath curl into the cold air" creates a slight temperature contradiction that momentarily disrupts spatial logic. Second, "The vanishing point in every painting pulled the eye into nothingness" is a micro tell-not-show that summarizes the gallery's effect rather than letting it emerge through Elias's gaze. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; information density is high. The final line "didn't look back" is a stock phrase but fits the closure image without obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is mostly clean with strong imagery ("shadow lingered...in the bones piled in the catacombs") and varied syntax. However, several scaffold phrases appear: "It was why he lived in the sewer, why he hoarded broken things, why he agonized..." is a template-cadence run. "The cog was the key" and "they would understand. They had to" edge toward stock phrasing. Information density is good, but a few beats (the concentric-circles note arrangement, the inner-versus-outer-layer exposition) slow momentum with summary rather than scene pressure. No major loops or metaphor muddles, but the repetitive "why" structure and occasional telling where showing would sharpen the moment warrant deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening line anchors voice effectively. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "It wasn't the music. It was the noise. Not the kind that filled the air, but the kind that lived in the silences" repeats the same idea across three beats. The phrase "vanishing arts" appears three times without functional evolution, and "expectantly resigned" in paragraph 2 is a paradoxical modifier that reads more decorative than enacted. Stock metaphors ("vines around a trellis," "ice over a pond") and the phrase "her throat tight" at closure slightly muddy the final image. Clarity and momentum are generally strong, but figurative density in the final third ("leaves settling after a storm," "walls drinking in") approaches overwriting without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening: "rusted greenhouse…abandoned botanical gardens" / "relic…cracked…sagging…forgotten" / "decay…ruins…claimed everything else" recycle synonyms for neglect without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs appear: "She was…," "She had…," "She pressed…," "She took…" across key beats flatten rhythm. The phrase "informally wise" appears twice (once as exposition, once echoed at closure), and "gentle rebellion" is declared then repeated verbatim, reading as motif checklist rather than organic recurrence. Figurative language in the fruit-vision beat ("world dissolved," "colors…shifted like liquid memory," "felt whole") stacks metaphor without grounding sensory detail. Minor clarity slips: "whispered words she didn't fully understand but had memorized" contradicts itself within the clause.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; figurative language ("skeletal sentinel," "tongue" of paper, "nectar dusk") is vivid and purpose-driven. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Grammar and sequencing are clean. The phrase "the ink smudged as if written in haste" and "smooth as honey but edged with steel" are minor stock constructions but don't obscure clarity or dull the closure beat. One scaffold note: "He thought of the floating gardens… He thought of his own motivation" lists rather than integrates, a small momentum drag in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, vivid images ("seaweed sway," "exhaled warmth through their floorboards"), high information density. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Some scaffold remains: "the thing he had been chasing all along" is a placeholder that delays the reveal; "the houses that felt alive weren't listening to the world. They were listening to *themselves*" is clean but borders on expository summation rather than discovery through image. "Inadvertently profound" is slightly abstract. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language ("held breath," "shadows rearranged") is apt but dense in places without always advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short sentences at the climax, longer syntactic flow in exposition). Clarity and concision are mostly strong; information density is high. Two patterns recur: "The diver [verb]" stems repeat across five sentences in the second half, creating mild template cadence (−0.4). One paraphrase loop: the final two paragraphs restate "she understood / she had thought / she felt" the revelation in overlapping language without added pressure (−0.2). No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors. Figurative language ("violet liquid swirling like captured twilight") is purposeful and sparing.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies appropriately and information density is generally high. Two paraphrase loops appear: "The staircase was no different, he reasoned. Its balance was perfect..." immediately follows setup without advancing pressure, and the hundredth-step paragraph restates waiting without new information. Minor filter-verb stacking ("he wondered," "he reasoned," "he had always been") in reflective beats slightly dulls immediacy. The opening and closing sentences frame well but the climactic moment (dice settling, staircase shuddering) compresses action that warrants more tactical detail. Overall clarity and propulsion are strong with scattered inefficiencies.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high in the opening (greenhouse, smog, brush history compressed efficiently). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor figurative density in the first half (smog "thick as wool," moonlight "like liquid silver") remains coherent and voice-motivated. Slight momentum drag in the middle section where reflection on kindness-as-language extends without scene pressure; the piece breathes rather than tightens. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and purposeful sensory detail. The opening line anchors voice effectively, and information density is high in the museum and bakery beats. However, mild paraphrase loops appear ("displaced persons brought the craft here, but displacement took it away" echoes the earlier "displaced persons who had once fled here"), and the phrase "rosewater dread" stands out as slightly ornamental without POV grounding. The final sequence accelerates well, but the bread-baking beat could be more tactile. No major artifacts touch the closure image, keeping the prose strong.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies across beats, and figurative language is vivid without overwhelming clarity: "black teeth of the island," "a dying breath against the storm," "petals to reveal a core of black glass." However, several lines loop conceptually: "the same latent radiance" appears twice in quick succession (paragraph 1 and paragraph 10), and "the hunger stone remembered. And so did he" echoes the earlier "the stone had forgotten them" without advancing new pressure. Minor scaffold: "This time, he let it go longer. / This time, when he dropped it, it fell" uses identical stems without taught pattern. Information density is high in peak beats, but the two instances of near-paraphrase lower momentum slightly. No filter-verb stacks or register drift appear.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("silver where his features should have been," "elastic," "dying ember"). Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "lingering luminance" recurs as motif but also as filler; "whispering advisor's voice" is restated in adjacent beats without added pressure. Template cadence in mid-section: "He reached… He flipped… He stepped… He forced…" across four paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("rippling like water," "shattering ice") and elevated diction ("unbosomed," "coiled") in peak beats blur immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph retains the same ornamental register), triggering the disallow-9+ rule and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in early beats. However, the middle third shows paraphrase loops: "He struck the driftwood again" recycles prior action without advancing pressure, and "The mallet moved faster" summarizes rather than dramatizes. The final paragraph stacks near-synonyms ("across the water, but through it, through the salt and the sky") that blur propulsion. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence; closure beat remains clear, capping non-closure deduction at −0.4 total.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes). The opening anchors voice and world efficiently. Two frictions: "The air smelled of damp and old secrets" leans on stock metaphor, and the phrase "something she could not name—curiosity, fear, the gnawing certainty" lists emotions that could be embodied instead. The final sprint sequence uses clear action verbs but repeats "she did not" twice in quick succession, a minor template echo. No paraphrase loops or major scaffolding, and the closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and confrontation beats. Minor scaffold: "He had expected opposition, but not from someone who understood the weight of the past" slightly paraphrases Liora's preceding dialogue without adding pressure. The phrase "drawing parallels had always been his method" tells rather than shows the method in action. Otherwise clean; no loops or template cadence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual texture. Clarity and concision are generally strong, though scaffolding appears: "He was an archeologist of abandoned dreams, though no one had given him that title" is expository self-description that stalls. "Its absence was interlaced with the town's memory" and "a keeper of echoes, a witness to the hushed blaze" lean toward purple phrasing and stock metaphor without earned pressure. One paraphrase loop: "he didn't flinch" after "stoically sensitive" restates without added density. Minor register drift into elevated diction ("hushed blaze," "wrestle against oblivion") reduces immediacy. Loop and scaffold total: −0.6 in Q7; no artifact touches closure directly, so non-closure cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in discovery beats (ledger contents, stamp description). However, several passages stack abstract metaphors without concrete anchors: "the blackout outside felt less like an absence of light and more like a veil lifting" followed by "The past was indexing him" creates figurative density that slightly obscures the moment's pressure. Minor paraphrase loop: "he would readjust his understanding" echoes the earlier "He readjusted his lantern" without adding meaning. No major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is often overwritten with stacked metaphors and synonym churn ("the shadow, once a mere absence, had peeled away like dead skin, leaving the sky a raw wound"). Several paraphrase loops: the cranes are folded, hung, and described fluttering across multiple paragraphs without new pressure. Template cadence in the dream-selection sequence ("Some were too brittle... Others were too soft... But the ones she wanted"). The final beat uses italics and ellipsis for effect but clarity suffers—what physically happens when the light enters her? Figurative density obscures causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language ("the sky split open," "grief pooled in the hollows of her bones") is vivid, though some phrases edge toward over-writing ("jagged shards," "wavering shadows"). The final paragraph loops through thematic echoes ("back to the wreckage, back to the fire") without propelling new information. No major line-level artifacts obscure causality, but the closure beat is dulled by summary rather than a sharp image. Information density is high in descriptive passages but falls in the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is adequate. However, paraphrase loops appear: "This was different. This was personal" in paragraph 3 restates without adding pressure; "You feel it too, don't you?" followed by "He did" recaps rather than advances. Template cadence runs appear in paragraph 4 ("Elias didn't answer. He had spent...") and paragraph 10 ("Elias didn't answer. He did."). The closure beat—"The stars would wait. But the call wouldn't"—reads as coda rather than image with propulsion. Deductions: paraphrase −0.2, template stems −0.5, total −0.7 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (watch description layers time, guilt, and maternal loss in one beat). Minor loops appear: "guilt was a sieve" / "sieved hush" reads as intentional motif; "The truth wasn't just withheld; it had been sieved" repeats the metaphor without added pressure. "His breath hitched" and "His vision blurred" are stock embodiments. No template cadence or scaffold, and clarity remains strong throughout. The phrase "tempered regret" in the final paragraph feels like an authorial label rather than dramatized state.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is vivid and clean: "parapet clung like a scar," "blade above the sea," "burned" contact. Rhythm varies; no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor density loss in the middle (moon-phase exposition, repeated mention of untethering without new stakes) and the final paragraph's summary mode ("Some mistakes were recycled") soften momentum. Information density is good but not exceptional; no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and the prose carries momentum through most beats. Information density is generally high: "the astronomical compass grew heavy in his pocket" does double duty as physicality and metaphor. However, paraphrase loops appear: "What if he wasn't meant to follow his father's stars? What if the real navigation was learning to chart his own course?" restates the same insight without added pressure. Template cadence recurs in reflection-heavy paragraphs (e.g., multiple "The [noun] was [state]" constructions). Minor filter-verb stacks ("he wondered," "he realized," "he felt") dull immediacy in a few beats. The closure image is clean, but mid-section scaffold lowers the score and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is mostly clean with high information density and purposeful figurative language: "bioluminescent lake pulsed beneath the city, its waters glowing a faint, eerie blue like the last embers of a dying star." Sentence openings vary, and paragraph rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Two minor frictions: "the signature read" followed immediately by quoted text creates a brief scaffold moment, and "heavy in his pocket" recurs twice (baseball, signature "burning against his skin") in a paraphrase loop. These don't obscure causality or dull the closure image, so penalties remain light. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats; propulsion is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies across beats, and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in the ritual sequence (spice gathering, paste preparation, transformation). However, several prose artifacts diminish momentum: "The orchard hummed…its gnarled branches…its scent" stacks possessive constructions; "She had come here after…She had crumpled…She had come to conjure" loops "She had" stems across adjacent paragraphs. The phrase "reluctant metamorphosis" appears twice as a descriptor rather than dramatized pressure. "Tears cutting silver paths down her cheeks" is a stock visual. Template cadence in expository blocks (lines beginning "The first time…The second time…But this—this was different") flattens propulsion. These artifacts cluster in the first half; the transformation sequence tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is vivid and often striking ("her heart a compass spinning toward some unseen north where lost time pooled like mercury"), but overwriting accumulates across the piece: nearly every sentence in the middle section carries figurative language or abstract poeticism, creating density without momentum. Paraphrase loops appear (e.g., multiple sentences restating that some things are felt not seen, that names are layers, that breaking makes room for the new) and the piece relies on stock lyric constructions ("not to mend what was broken, but to understand how the breaking made room for something new" echoes self-help idiom). Filter verbs ("she saw," "she knew," "she had not understood") stack in the reflective passages, and the final third contains template cadence ("This was not prediction; this was memory in reverse") and synonym churn ("the cruelty and the mercy," "the quiet, choking beauty"). The Patterned-artifact penalty pack applies: baseline −0.8 for loops, register drift, and template stems; an additional −0.5 because artifacts appear in the closure beat ("the quiet, choking beauty of what endures" in the penultimate paragraph). This triggers the disallow-9+ global cap and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies; opening long sentence contrasts with later fragments. Information density is high: "colony vessel, then prison, then refugee ark" compresses history efficiently. Two minor loops: "shadows—the ones inside her, the ones clinging" and "The ship was gone, but the work was done" paraphrase prior lines without new pressure. Filter verbs ("She traced," "She pressed") cluster in action beats but remain voice-motivated. "Kwan Yin's Tear" and "liquid starlight" reappear purposefully. The phrase "long-dried tears" / "shimmer of long-dried tears" recurs across paragraphs without functional beat change. Figurative density ("pocket of the universe where time had folded," "wound where the universe had bled out") thickens the middle but remains legible. Apply −0.4 for paraphrase loops; no closure-scene artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear with vivid images ("black sand crunched," "ash painted the sky in shades of fire"). Several template phrases recur: "his heart still carried the weight," "the texture of transformation," "whispering hush" appears twice without reweighting. The phrase "She smiled, but it was a sad thing" is a common construction. Filter verbs ("saw," "felt," "knew") appear in clusters during key beats, flattening immediacy. Paraphrase loop: "orchestrated coincidences" is restated as "small, deliberate acts that nudged the world toward kindness" without added pressure. Momentum is steady but not propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and most lines carry double duty (e.g., "She had seen the coded angles in the half-painted sundial outside his window—an old cipher, one only a few could read" delivers world detail, character knowledge, and plot setup). A few phrases edge toward ornamentation without adding pressure: "her breath steady, her mind calmly inventive" tells rather than shows the trait, and "the world held its breath" is a stock closer. The prose is clean and propulsive with no major loops or template cadence, but the final paragraph's abstract phrasing ("Somewhere, a lock clicked open") slightly dulls the closure image's concreteness.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or action. However, several beats rely on stock metaphors ("embers in a dying fire," "iron to a lodestone") and near-paraphrase loops appear in the opening ("No one else could see them—not truly—only the ripples…" echoes the earlier "slippery bodies darting… like living shadows"). The phrase "the promise became clear" is tell-heavy summary at a pivotal moment. Minor figurative muddle in "the aurora flared, the star dust ignited" where dual subjects blur the causal sequence. Cumulative penalty: −0.6 for loops and template metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors stacked in nearly every sentence ("forgotten god's watchtower," "scars across skin," "moon lit rivers," "sky close enough to touch"). Many images are vivid but several verge on mixed or strained: "rarefied his anger, distilled it...like the edge of a scalpel" conflates gaseous, liquid, and solid metaphors within one move. Template openings recur ("He had come here," "The storm outside"). Paraphrase loop: the vigil/waiting concept is restated multiple times without added pressure. The closure beat is not obscured, capping deductions at −0.8 for density and −0.4 for loops, totaling roughly −1.2 within the non-closure cap.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clean and grammatical with varied syntax, but suffers from mild overwriting: "dignified chaos," "hidden overture," "questions into destinations" recur as thematic placeholders without concrete tethering. The needle-card description ("intricate patterns," "grid of tiny perforations") remains abstract; figurative language ("storm in his chest," "roar" of the brook) is conventional. Two paraphrase loops: "the duel was over / the journey had just begun" restates the prior claim without added pressure. No major artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at ~−0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; sentences multitask without padding. The opening effectively anchors voice and stakes. However, paraphrase loops appear: "molts personalities monthly" → "didn't wake up one morning forgetting the name" recycles the concept within a few lines. Template cadence in the backstory section ("Elias had said… had only smiled… had pocketed") stacks past-perfect constructions. "Blooming resistance" receives a summary-definition paragraph that stalls momentum. These artifacts are contained to non-closure beats, limiting deduction under the accumulation cap, but they prevent entry into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot). Figurative language is vivid and mostly coherent ("smoke through the hollows," "moths to a flame," "dark as spilled ink"), though "strategically creative" and "loophole" border on abstract convenience. One paraphrase loop: "not to keep time, but to remember" is restated in the same paragraph as "its silence was louder than any metronome." Template cadence appears in backstory: "She'd meant it... back when... Now, that creativity..." Minor filter-verb stacks ("had come," "had told," "had played") in reflective passages dull immediacy. The final image is strong and concrete. Grammar and tense are clean; no pronoun ambiguity. Proofreading is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "fragile tapestry of belief" rephrases the "collective memory" concept without adding pressure; "a presence, like an echo waiting to be answered" stacks metaphors without advancing clarity. Template cadence in the dream sequence: "A woman—her face familiar… held a fruit… 'Memory is a garden.'" Filter-verb stacks dull immediacy ("The blossoms' glow seeped into her skin as she closed her eyes"). Stock metaphors ("thief," "keeper," "garden") cluster without fresh synthesis. The final paragraph's "unaware of the storm's true nature" / "But she would tell them" loop restates intent. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.4, filter stacks −0.5, template cadence −0.3, total reduction ~−1.2 from a mid-6 anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm is controlled, with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, figurative language saturates nearly every paragraph ("tides of remembrance," "color of unspoken apologies," "threads shimmered, their fibers shifting as if alive"), creating density that occasionally stalls momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "The compass pulsed... its rhythm matching the placid drip" closely echoes prior compass description. Template cadence is minimal. Clarity holds, but the piece would benefit from one or two beats of plain statement to offset the lyricism and increase propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character—dust, gravity, and storm motifs recur in a controlled way. There’s minimal redundancy and no obvious syntactic templates or metaphor muddle; the line-level writing would fit comfortably in many serious journals. A few lines veer into slightly flat abstraction or thematic telling rather than image (“She didn’t need drama. She needed to see the world as it was”), which softens the closing cadence. Overall, momentum and clarity are preserved, and the final image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “the canyon walls hummed with the weight of silence” and the frost patterns as a map do multiple jobs at once. Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and largely free of scaffold or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to blur clarity, and there are no mixed metaphors that undercut sense. The final paragraph lands cleanly, reusing established objects and concepts without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level writing is polished, with strong imagery and generally efficient sentences that advance both atmosphere and character. Metaphors are rich but mostly controlled; the opening image of panes “etched into delicate, silent symphonies of ice” sets the stylistic bar and the story sustains it. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and syntax varies enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical. A slight tendency toward consistent lushness in low-pressure beats is the only minor check on higher-band scores.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and economical, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and information. Figurative language is present but not overstacked; images like jagged glass catching lantern light “like teeth” and words “weaving through the shelves” are vivid without muddling action. There is little to no scaffolding or synonym churn, and transitions between present action and recalled history are smoothly handled. The final cadence is controlled, with short, plain lines after more ornate description underscoring the earned stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is clean and economical, with images doing multiple jobs (the bells as objects, history, and signal) and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Rhythm is varied enough to sustain the quiet mood without becoming monotonous, and there are no noticeable mixed metaphors or overwritten stretches. A few phrases lean familiar, but they don’t materially dull momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are mostly clean, and many lines do double duty for mood and meaning (“its iron ribs draped in wisteria that bloomed violet even as twilight bled into the water below”). The prose leans lush but stops short of true purple; metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned with breath, water, light, and memory. There’s minimal redundancy and momentum doesn’t stall despite reflective passages. A touch more restraint at the very end could heighten impact, but clarity and rhythm are consistently high.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, concise, and image-dense without tipping into purple; lines often do double duty advancing atmosphere and character. Figurative language is coherent and thematically aligned (vines, grain of paper, light/time), and there are no significant loops or scaffold sentences. Rhythm and syntax vary smoothly, and the closure image is clear and not muddied by over-stacked metaphors. A few abstractions could be sharpened into more concrete sensations, but they don’t materially slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in length and structure, images are clear, and almost every line does at least two jobs (world-building plus mood, or action plus theme). Figurative language is sparing and apt, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess; the recurring motifs of rust, chains, and seeds are handled cleanly. There’s little visible scaffolding or redundancy, and rhythm adapts to pressure without bogging down in exposition. A tiny amount of thematic telling in the closing lines is the main craft-level blemish.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lean yet evocative, with strong images (“hulls split open like overripe fruit,” “a hollow, echoing blue, like the moment a wave pulls back from the shore”) that do multiple jobs at once. Sentence rhythm varies nicely and carries momentum; there’s little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. A few metaphors cluster toward the purple edge, but they remain internally coherent and don’t obscure sense or closure. Line-level craft is solidly publishable, even if not quite astonishing.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with most metaphors (“windows glowing like fireflies trapped in glass,” “hands trembling like leaves”) clear and thematically aligned. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled, and sentences usually perform multiple jobs (setting, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding. There’s minimal redundancy or synonym churn; momentum is maintained despite the lyric density. A slight tendency toward uniformly lush description risks softness but does not significantly obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, concrete images, and a general absence of padding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language (“hummed like dying bees,” “metronome for his thoughts”) is mostly fresh and apt, and description often does double duty for mood and theme. A few moments tip toward familiar phrasing or explained metaphor, but they don’t materially blunt the closure image. Overall, the prose is publication-ready with only minor tightening possible for even greater compression.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level writing is strong: varied sentence rhythm, compact paragraphs, and mostly efficient figurative language (“gnawed at her ribs like a trapped rat” is vivid and precise). Prose carries multiple loads at once—advancing action while building atmosphere and interiority—without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. There is some flirtation with purple (“whetstone of necessity,” “trembling certainty” mid-text), but it stays largely coherent and doesn’t obscure causality or the final image. Tightening a few overtly explanatory sentences would heighten momentum even more.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and dense with meaning; almost every image pulls double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, rarely tipping into muddle or mixed metaphor. There are minimal redundancies or scaffolding phrases, and the prose carries momentum despite being largely interior and descriptive. A very few phrases (“as if it, too, had been mapped,” “she had shed a weight she hadn’t known she carried”) lean on familiar constructions, keeping this a notch below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and economical, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and interiority. Imagery is consistent and rarely overwrought; metaphors are extended rather than piled indiscriminately, and there’s little in the way of scaffolding or synonym loops. A few phrases lean on familiar formulations (“the question never faded,” “second chance program”) that slightly flatten otherwise sharp textures. Momentum fits the contemplative mode: it’s measured but not stagnant, with no line-level artifacts that obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, varied in rhythm, and usually do more than one job in terms of mood, character, and motion. Imagery is controlled rather than florid, with only a few slightly familiar turns, and there’s little to no redundancy or scaffold. The opening and closing images (forecourt, lens/projector light) bookend the piece cleanly. It’s very competent, though it doesn’t yet reach the level of sentence-by-sentence surprise or compression associated with top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied in structure, and generally do more than one job (advancing image, character, and theme at once). Figurative language is frequent but controlled; images like cracks as “silver rivers” and the seedling “coiled like a question mark” are precise rather than florid. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and the prose maintains momentum despite its contemplative mode. A couple of abstract phrases (“He was wisely pragmatic about it.”) are slightly flatter than the surrounding texture but do not significantly dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences vary in length, information density is decent, and the prose carries momentum without obvious scaffolding or loops. Imagery is clear and rarely overextended; the few more ornate lines mostly land and don’t cloud sense. There is some tendency toward familiar phrasing (“the weight of it,” “the universe itself was holding its breath”), which keeps the texture from feeling fully fresh. Still, there are no major artifacts or confusions, and the final image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are rhythmic, varied, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for mood and meaning. A few phrases lean toward the familiar (“her breath hitched,” “holding its breath”) but they don’t dominate or blunt key beats. Figurative language is present but not so thick as to obscure clarity; action remains legible even at the more lyric moments. There is little obvious scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the final lines land crisply.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically attentive, and information-dense, often doing double duty for mood and character. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and legible, with few if any mixed metaphors; it rarely clogs momentum. There is little evident scaffold or paraphrase looping, and transitions between description and thought are clean. A handful of phrases (“auroral sorrow,” “weight of a swallowed truth”) skim the edge of purple, but they don’t significantly obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, mostly concise, and vary in rhythm; description generally does more than one job. Figurative language is present but not excessive, and the industrial lexicon fits the scene. There are a couple of weaker or mixed images and some familiar turns of phrase, yet no significant loops or scaffolding that sap momentum. The final line is clean and thematically pointed, even if a touch declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, mostly economical, and often do double duty for atmosphere and characterization. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt, and scaffolding or paraphrase loops are minimal. There is some repetition of structures (“She had…” / “She did not…”) that could be varied or pruned for even tighter momentum, especially in a short piece. Overall, the prose passes a high-bar readability and musicality test, though it stops short of truly dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and pull their weight without obvious scaffolding or repetition. There is some tendency toward safe, slightly familiar lyricism (“cradled the valley like a lullaby,” “golden as dawn light,” “beneath the hush of dreaming roots”), but the metaphors are coherent and not piled so densely as to become purple. Information density is good; backstory and exposition are economical and integrated into the flow. The prose is polished enough for mid-tier venues but could use a sharper, more surprising image palette to match top-tier expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“the way the air inside settled like dust on a bronze plate”). Figurative language is generally coherent and precise, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence advances mood or concept. There is some risk of over-saturation with metaphors in a short space, which slightly flattens impact in places, but clarity and momentum never significantly suffer. The final sentences land cleanly and lyrically without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is tight and largely free of scaffolding; most sentences carry multiple loads (image, mood, and information) without feeling overstuffed. Figurative language is selective and coherent, with music and light motifs recurring in a controlled way rather than as purple overload. Syntax varies enough to keep rhythm lively, and there are no notable clarity lapses or repetition loops. A few phrases edge toward familiar (“stomach dropped”), but not enough to drag momentum or distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong information density and generally multi-tasking sentences (advancing mood, character, and world simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise (“a deep, bruised violet, the hue of twilight over a battlefield”) and thematically aligned with the stakes. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; progression is clear and momentum holds despite the meditative tone. A few abstractions (“the muffled clarity of truth, half-heard, half-felt”) edge toward nebulous, but they don’t materially blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are precise, metaphors mostly clean, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language density is high but controlled; phrases like “the kind that hummed, the kind that held symphonies” earn their place. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and the prose carries both atmosphere and interiority without clogging momentum for this lyric mode. I see no major artifacts, loops, or clarity issues that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight and vivid, with minimal redundancy and good information density; many sentences do double duty for mood and concept (“world… unfolded like a map drawn by a mad cartographer”). Rhythm varies nicely between longer lyric lines and shorter impact beats (“The tablet was the key.” / “The tablet hadn’t been a key—it had been a warning.”). A few metaphors (“procedural generation… of time,” “periodically eternal”) flirt with pseudo-technical or faux-profound phrasing, softening sharpness rather than clarifying it. Still, line-level control is strong and momentum rarely drags.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density; most lines do multiple jobs (world, emotion, and theme at once). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and metaphors like “the filament of hush” and “sound of silence given shape” are coherent and on-theme. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and momentum is maintained despite the contemplative mode. The final lines land cleanly without explanatory padding, letting the image carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and rich without tipping into muddled purple; most sentences do dual work for atmosphere and characterization. Sensory details are specific and purposeful, and there is little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or synonym-churn. Metaphors (wound in the city’s skin, bruised sky) are coherent and thematically aligned, and the final paragraph lands with a clear, charged image. A few lines are slightly abstract (e.g., “progress laterally”) but they remain legible and in-character.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: vivid images, efficient sentences that usually do more than one job, and minimal redundancy. Figurative language (“liquid twilight,” “the scent coiled around him”) is frequent but largely coherent and in-register, not so dense as to muddy clarity. Paragraphing and rhythm support momentum through a mostly reflective scene. There are a few familiar phrases (“weight of what he carried”) but they don’t significantly dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose shows strong rhythm, vivid imagery, and good information density; most sentences carry more than one function (world, mood, character) without clutter. There is some repetition of favored metaphoric frames (fabric, threads, texture) and a slight flirtation with purple prose, but coherence remains intact and momentum doesn’t stall. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and paragraphing supports the scene’s shifts in pressure. The final image of the limp rope “whispering secrets” is clean and well-calibrated.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and multi-tasking—advancing atmosphere, character, and worldbuilding in tandem. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and thematically coherent (ribs, bones, groaning hulls, whispers, hums), without muddled or mixed metaphors. There is some mild repetition in sentence structures and a tendency toward uniformly lush description, but it rarely drags momentum or obscures meaning. A touch more pruning of near-duplicate emotional statements (“This was why she had come,” then restated later) would tighten an already polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished, with varied syntax and few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops; most sentences carry at least two jobs (world, mood, character). Some metaphors and abstractions (“ghost of feeling itself,” “half-truths people told themselves to sleep at night”) lean purple but don’t muddy clarity. Rhythm breathes well between longer lyric lines and shorter, grounding beats, especially in dialogue. Strong, stylish prose that could tighten slightly by trusting image over explanation in a few spots.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences are clean, well-paced, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding; most lines carry more than one function (atmosphere plus character or plot). Figurative language (“unseen gears,” “salt and possibility”) is used sparingly enough to avoid purple overload. There are no noticeable grammatical errors or line-level confusions, and action order remains clear. The prose is polished and publishable but not yet so distinctive or compressed as to push into the topmost band.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are clear (“a single, perfect line of charcoal, like a stitch in the fabric of the world”) and multitask for atmosphere, theme, and action. The prose leans lush but mostly avoids purple excess or metaphor muddle; sentences pull their weight and maintain momentum. There’s little visible scaffolding or synonym-churn, and syntax variety keeps the piece from feeling mechanical. A few phrases (“weight of centuries,” “lost languages”) skew familiar, but they don’t materially blunt the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images like “time bent like wet paper” and “water… in slow, deliberate spirals” are vivid and precise, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus mood plus character). The rhythm varies, avoiding mechanical cadence, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Some metaphors flirt with purple but remain mostly controlled and coherent. The final lines are clear and impactful, even if the conceptual stakes they carry are a bit under-specified.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and efficient, with metaphors that mostly land cleanly and do multiple jobs (“sunlight through stained glass” captures both patterning and tenderness). There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the information density is high without feeling overwrought. The lyricism is steady but not so stacked that it muddies clarity or stalls momentum. A few generalized abstractions near the end (“knowledge that she was not gone, not entirely”) slightly blunt the sharpness of the imagery, keeping this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, largely free of scaffolding or redundancy, and maintains momentum while carrying significant atmosphere. Sentence-level music is good, with varied openings and lengths and few clichés; figurative language is measured and mostly apt. Information density is high—almost every line advances character, setting, or stakes. Minor repetitions (“frayed…frayed”) are noticeable but not structurally harmful, and nothing obscures causality or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level prose is polished, with vivid images (“bark splitting…smooth and iridescent beneath,” “yielding like warm wax”) and generally efficient sentences that carry multiple functions at once. There is some repetition of structures (“She had spent,” “She had come”), but it reads as intentional cadence rather than scaffolding. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and clarity is never compromised. A couple of slightly abstract phrases (“circuitously sincere”) flirt with preciousness but do not materially harm momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “oil on water,” “gutted fishing shack, its walls patched with tar and hope,” and “half-hidden by brambles and the skeletal remains of a ship’s mast” are vivid without stacking into confusion. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, creating good momentum and breath. There’s some mild risk of purple prose, but figurative density never quite tips into muddle, and there are no obvious paraphrase loops or syntactic templates. The final sentence elegantly braids motif and concept without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lean for this mode: most sentences perform multiple tasks (world-building, mood, and plot) without visible scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are controlled and coherent, and rhythm varies nicely between longer descriptive lines and shorter, clipped beats as tension rises (“The pearl cracked. / Light spilled out like blood, and the cave screamed.”). There are no evident loops or template cadences that slow momentum, and syntax remains clear even as the imagery thickens. The piece is polished enough for high-level markets, with only marginal gains possible from making a few phrases even more character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and economical, with vivid but not overstuffed imagery (“puddles reflecting the fractured light,” “absences that gaped like missing teeth”). Sentences generally do double duty—advancing setting and character simultaneously—without noticeable scaffold or synonym loops. Abstract phrases like “reactively visionary” and “navigated absences” skirt theory-speak but are supported by concrete images and do not obscure clarity. Line-level control is high enough for immediate publication in many venues.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and high-density, with sentences often doing double duty for mood and information (“the mist clinging to his ankles like a living thing”). Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to become purple or muddled, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. There are a few familiar turns of phrase (“swallowing the streetlights whole,” “like a waking beast”) but they don’t materially dull the closing image or clarity. No major scaffolding, repetition loops, or register slips interfere with momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm is varied and generally purposeful, balancing longer, flowing lines with shorter emphatic beats at moments of realization (“His breath hitched.”). Most sentences do double duty—advancing action while reinforcing atmosphere or theme—without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is present but not piled on to the point of confusion, and the prose remains clear even at peak emotional beats. Apart from a few slightly generic formulations, line-level craft is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and efficient, with some strong images (light fracturing, air tasting metallic, fields pulling at reality). There are a few familiar similes and phrases (“like a dying flame,” “chorus of the damned,” “sharp enough to cut”) that lean toward cliché but don’t seriously impair clarity or momentum. Information density is good; most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus interiority). No major scaffolding, loops, or figurative muddle interfere with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: vivid images, good rhythm, and sentences that pull multiple duties without bloat (“The ink spread in fractal patterns, branching into equations he almost recognized.”). There’s minimal redundancy, and the prose maintains momentum even in reflective passages. One notable slip is the line “turned rules into suggestions and borders into suggestions,” which reads like an unintentional repetition and slightly blurs what should be a sharp conceptual beat. Overall, the density and clarity are high enough that this remains publishable-grade with only minor polishing needed.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong sentence-level rhythm and a high information density: individual lines usually advance both atmosphere and character. Imagery is often apt and memorable (spectacles “thin as the veins in the bonsai leaves,” gold leaf like “captured sunlight”), and figurative language, while frequent, remains coherent rather than muddled. There is some tendency toward repeated constructions and familiar formulations (“thick with the weight of what had been,” “not an absence, but a presence”), but these don’t seriously drag momentum or clarity. Line craft is very solid and nearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and efficient; most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, character, and theme) without scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors (“like a leaf caught in a storm,” containers as a city) are clear and coherent, with no significant figurative muddle. There are mild recurrences of similar conceptual language (layers, half-remembered, ghosts), but they read as intentional motif rather than accidental loops. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep momentum and clarity high.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight and vivid, with metaphors that mostly land and carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, theme) at once. Information density is good; almost every sentence advances either atmosphere or the evolving concept of the Compass. A few turns lean toward the ornamental (“half-finished world,” some repeated “hum” imagery), but they don’t obscure sense or stall momentum. Rhythm varies well enough to avoid mechanical cadence, and there are no noticeable scaffold loops or clarity slips.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with few redundancies and no confusing syntax. Figurative language is vivid but restrained enough that it rarely feels purple; most images earn their keep by advancing mood or theme. There are minor moments of conceptual shorthand (“trust was a currency she spent carefully”) and slightly abstract summarizing of her operations that could be made more concrete. Overall, momentum is well-maintained and there are no noticeable loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, clean grammar, and high information density—most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors are generally apt and not over-stacked; the language is vivid without collapsing into purple excess. There is minimal redundancy and no obvious scaffolding or template cadence. The final sentences land cleanly and musically, recharging earlier motifs without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and economical, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and information. Figurative language (mist “like a living thing,” wings “like stained glass”) is selective rather than over-stacked, and there are few if any noticeable loops or scaffolding lines. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to maintain momentum in what is essentially a quiet scene. Line-level craft is already at a publishable standard, though not yet singularly dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, high information density, and images that usually carry more than one layer of work (setting, mood, theme). Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent, avoiding muddle or redundancy. There are no visible loops, scaffolding, or syntactic artifacts that slow momentum, and the final image (falcon circling, cry against the ice) lands cleanly. Occasionally the diction skirts the edge of over-lyrical, but it doesn’t materially blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and economical for its lushness: most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent; images like “fault line…of time” and “cloak the color of old bruises” feel apt rather than overwrought. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, flowing lines and shorter cadences that mark key beats (“The tuner smiled.” “Then he walked.”). There are no notable loops, syntactic artifacts, or clarity slips that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) and the rhythm modulates well between exposition and peak beats. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful (“loneliness gnawed at her ribs like a starving thing,” “honeyed poison”); repetition and scaffolding are minimal. A few images and adjectives could be pared for even greater impact, but they don’t obscure causality or blur the closure image. Overall, the prose is publication-ready with only light refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences generally carry multiple functions (advancing action, deepening mood, hinting theme) and vary in rhythm to support tension and release. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise (“silence so thick it could smother a scream,” “light that pooled in the corners like spilled wine”); it seldom muddles sense or stalls momentum. There are no significant loops or scaffolding redundancies, and grammar/punctuation are clean. The high density of metaphor pushes toward purple at moments, but not enough to obscure causality or dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and high-density, with metaphors that mostly land cleanly and do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, emotion). There is some repetition of favored constructions and phrases, and the figurative load is heavy enough that a few lines risk purple, but clarity of action and emotional stakes is never lost. Sentences vary in length and rhythm appropriately, slowing for reflection and tightening as pressure peaks around the memory vision. Line-level trimming could increase sharpness, but there are no major artifacts or confusions.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: high information density, largely no scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and metaphors that generally pull multiple weights (tone, worldbuilding, interiority). The rhythm suits a lyric short—unhurried but not stagnant—and key beats (“the air shimmered like heat off a forge,” “labyrinth sighed around her”) land cleanly. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled; only an occasional phrase (“secrets thickening like syrup,” “orchid-scented wind”) feels a touch ornamental rather than necessary. Clarity and momentum remain intact through the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and largely economical: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, characterization) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and apt, with only a few edges flirting with purple without truly obscuring sense. Rhythm varies well between long, lush sentences and shorter emphatic beats (“My breath hitched.”). There is little in the way of paraphrase loops or mechanical template cadence, supporting smooth momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level writing is polished: sentences are clear, varied in rhythm, and nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is used selectively and coherently, enhancing mood rather than obscuring sense (e.g., “light spilling across the floor like liquid honey”). Redundancy is minimal, with only slight reiteration of the “relic” notion, and there are no significant grammatical or clarity issues. The final image is clean and unblurred by purple prose or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and economical, with clear sentences and a consistent rhythm that supports the contemplative tone. Descriptive passages tend to pull double duty for atmosphere and character, and there are few if any true scaffolding or synonym loops. A handful of generic turns of phrase and light repetition (“she had spent years,” “she had come to the observatory…”) slightly blunt the impact, as does occasional summary where scene would sharpen stakes. Nonetheless, nothing in the prose materially obscures causality or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight, musical, and high in information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors (“twisted like the fingers of a drowning man,” “voices weaving… like silk threads”) are vivid and coherent, with only mild risk of accumulation but no real muddle. There is little scaffolding or redundancy; momentum holds through to the final image. It’s polished enough for publication, though a ruthless line edit could trim a few slightly familiar phrases to reach true top-tier sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and images that usually do more than one job (e.g., the cast as both medical object and written-over text of fear). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent with the tone (“mind unspools like a tangled net,” “lotus-hearted ache”). Sentence rhythm supports mood and escalation, avoiding mechanical cadences or redundant paraphrase. A few phrases verge on the ornate, but they don’t obscure sense or dull the closure image, keeping the prose in the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, mostly economical, and images pull double duty for atmosphere and theme. The figurative language is frequent but controlled, staying within a coherent palette of light, fog, and decay; it rarely feels purple or mixed. There are no obvious scaffolding sentences, synonym loops, or clarity errors; each paragraph advances mood or narrative. A slight lushness may be a touch much for some editors, but it doesn’t impede propulsion or obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, image-rich, and multi-purpose, with few redundancies and solid rhythmic variation. Metaphors are mostly coherent and thematically apt (sound as language, trumpet as funnel, stone as wet clay), and descriptive density serves atmosphere rather than smothering it. There are minor flirtations with over-decoration (e.g., occasionally stacking simile on simile), but they don’t materially obscure cause and effect or dull the ending. Overall momentum holds, and each paragraph adds new pressure or texture rather than circling.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: images like cicadas as a “living metronome” and gardens “monitored, the soil tested for ‘subversive growth’” are vivid without becoming purple. Sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) efficiently, and there’s little to no redundancy or scaffolding. Syntax varies enough to keep momentum, and the closing lines are sharp and memorable. I see no major artifacts, mixed metaphors, or rhythm glitches that impede clarity or impact.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, varied sentence structures, and high information density—most lines do double or triple duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and grounded; extended metaphors (cathedral shell, photosynthesis, armistice) sustain rather than collide. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or clarity failures, and the final lines land cleanly. At times the imagery stack borders on lush, and one or two abstractions could be traded for more concrete embodiment to reach an even higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and economical for its density: most sentences advance setting, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is rich but generally coherent and apt (“like the ghost of a coin,” “love that had petrified into something cold and beautiful”). There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the rhythm carries momentum despite the lyric mode. A few metaphors flirt with lushness, but they don’t blur clarity or undercut the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are concise yet layered, metaphor is generally sharp (“curled like smoke,” “mausoleum of extinct syllables”), and most lines do double duty for mood and information. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the rhythm carries the reader cleanly into and through the climax. A few phrases lean toward the familiar or abstract (“the path ahead was uncertain,” “the first stroke was always the hardest”), slightly softening an otherwise precise texture. Still, momentum and clarity are never in doubt, and the final image of writing with ambient ink is memorably framed.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and strong image density that usually does multiple jobs at once (advancing mood, theme, and character). Metaphors are generally coherent and apt, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Description integrates with action rather than stalling it, and the final cadence (“They were dancing”) neatly recharges prior material. A few moments risk mild purple prose but do not materially blur clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, and most do double duty, advancing mood and character alongside information. Figurative language is rich but controlled, with few if any strained metaphors or redundancies. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or template cadences that bog momentum. The final paragraph in particular lands cleanly, revisiting earlier images (pigeon, meteorite, survival) in a distilled form.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, dense with information, and generally avoid redundancy while maintaining momentum in a quiet scene. Imagery is rich and mostly coherent (“drifting prism terrace,” “fractured hush,” storm codes, spiraled grain) and often does double duty for setting and emotion. That said, figurative language is nearly constant, creating a risk of purple saturation and making a few phrases (“featherly determined,” “sound of light breaking into silence”) feel slightly ornamental. Trimming one or two metaphors per paragraph would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and often quite beautiful (“as though the city itself exhaled” is emblematic). Description tends to do double duty for mood and world-building without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. A few phrases lean on familiar shorthand (“his heart pounding,” “for the first time in years, he felt something akin to peace”) but do not materially dull the closure. Overall line-level craft is publication-ready with minor room for sharpening cliché-adjacent moments.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, syntactically varied, and generally efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and information. Some metaphor and abstraction (“quiet song of light,” “cheerful gloom,” “like a wound that had never healed”) verge on the purple, but they remain coherent and legible. There is minor conceptual repetition around “missing pieces,” “paths,” and “lost things,” and a few lines summarize states that might be more vivid if rendered in action. Nonetheless, momentum is maintained, and the final image is clear and rhythmically satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and image-rich without often tipping into purple; “sky smeared with stars” and “ribcage of salt-bleached wood” are striking yet legible. Most lines do more than one job, combining mood, setting, and character, and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few abstract phrases (“serenade the dullness”) and repeated constructions nibble at the edge of ornament, but they don’t seriously drag momentum or clarity. The final image is sharp and carries the earlier motifs efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization (“her toes curling against the cool damp as if testing the earth’s pulse”). Figurative language is frequent yet mostly precise and thematically cohesive, building a unified texture rather than a muddle. There are no evident scaffolding phrases, repetition loops, or syntactic monotony; line-level clarity and momentum are preserved. The one restraint is that the figurative density, especially around cosmic imagery, sometimes edges toward purple and could benefit from a touch more spareness in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with a good balance between image and clarity; phrases like “tiny prison for the light” and “skeletal cathedral” are vivid without descending into sludge. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. Sentence and paragraph rhythms vary enough to keep momentum, and the closure image is clean. Some metaphors feel familiar, but they don’t materially dull the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clean grammar, and metaphors that are generally precise and non-intrusive (“silver light spilling like liquid mercury,” “ink bleeding into the paper like water through cracked earth”). Most sentences do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and character without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The prose maintains momentum despite a quiet plot, with no major loops or purple excess. A few phrases (“shattered dreams,” “things that don’t leave marks”) lean familiar, but they don’t materially dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, sensory, and generally pull multiple duties (worldbuilding, mood, character) without padding. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to become purple, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or mechanical cadences. Rhythm and paragraphing support a slow, meditative build. The main limitation is that the prose occasionally states thematic concepts directly where an image or action might do the work more subtly.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid metaphors (“veins of a forgotten god,” “map etched into the floor, its lines shifting like living veins”) and good information density. A few lines edge into purple or slightly awkward abstraction, especially when labeling traits rather than dramatizing them (“sensitively perceptive nature,” “Legacy’s burden settled over him like a shroud”). Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained throughout, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Rhythm and paragraphing support the slow-burn tension of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, musical, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for setting and emotion. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, and while “mirage” and certain constructions recur, they don’t tip into obvious looping or scaffolding. Rhythm varies well between longer, atmospheric lines and shorter, declarative beats at the bells and climax. A few metaphors (“mirrors of the world,” “borrowed heartbeat”) could edge toward overuse if expanded, but at this length they remain clear and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: images are concrete (ink-stained clipboard, singed treaty, warm coin), and most sentences do double duty for mood and character. There is some repetition of abstract formulations (“price of redemption,” “worth it”) and a touch of purple in parts, but it doesn’t materially slow momentum. Syntax varies, and paragraphing is purposeful, with no obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. The final paragraphs land clearly and cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that typically do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus theme, or character plus mood). Repetition (“inch by inch, year by year”) reads as intentional emphasis rather than scaffolding, and there is little to no synonym churn or filler. Metaphors (“the land’s veins,” “vessel”) are coherent and extended rather than mixed. The prose sustains momentum despite reflective passages, keeping the piece taut for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery and generally efficient sentences that carry both atmosphere and character. Metaphors are mostly coherent and purposeful, and the paragraphing supports a gentle but continuous momentum through the ritual and its aftermath. There is some tendency toward purple or abstract diction and repeated constructions (e.g., “her body…her touch…her silence”), but not to the point of obscuring sense or dulling the closure. Overall line-level craft is well above average, though not yet razor-honed enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally free of scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically apt, with only occasional mild over-explanation (“Her motivation was simple, if radical”) rather than metaphorical muddle. Information moves efficiently; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. The prose sustains momentum for a lyric mode, though some thematic statements could be tightened to let images do more of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing image, character, and theme at once. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful; metaphors like “mist that curled above the clouds like smoke from a doused fire” or “forests had thinned to memory” sharpen rather than blur. There is little to no scaffold or synonym-churn, and the final line lands cleanly without over-explanation. A slight density of description risks slowing momentum in places, but not enough to materially harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are mostly clean, and nearly every line carries both atmosphere and character. There is a high density of figurative language (“aurora’s light like stars trapped in paper,” “voices rising like steam from snowmelt”), but the metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned with cold, melt, and sound. I see minimal paraphrase or scaffold; exposition about his past is concise and directly feeds the present ritual. The main limiting factor for top-tier is that the steady lyric intensity can verge on uniform, with few moments of sharper syntactic snap or compression to mark inflection points.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean, varied, and purposeful, with few true redundancies. Images like “each fissure a map of time’s slow unraveling” and “the bunker’s walls pressing in like the ribs of some great, slumbering beast” are vivid without becoming incoherent. There is occasional near-purple repetition (“precisely playful” echoed, some path/decay diction loops), but it doesn’t seriously drag momentum or blur sense. The prose could edge higher with slightly more restraint in abstract phrasing and a bit more concrete, scene-driving action in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, characterization), and generally avoid redundancy. The figurative language is dense but mostly precise and thematically unified, with only a few moments (“empirically ironic,” “encrypted devotion”) feeling slightly self-conscious rather than organic. Information flow is clear, and key beats are shown rather than summarized, so momentum holds despite the lyrical mode. Some readers at elite venues might want one or two images trimmed for maximum sharpness, but nothing here materially muddies the climax or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and emotion (“its walls breathing in time with some unseen rhythm” neatly links setting to theme). Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and not overstacked, avoiding mixed metaphors that would muddy sense. There is little evident scaffolding or repetition, and syntax shifts comfortably between longer descriptive lines and shorter, pressure-bearing sentences. A few abstractions (“weight of her own resentment,” “the past had changed”) could be sharpened, but they don’t materially dull momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, purposeful, and image-dense without tipping into muddle, and most do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus psychology). Metaphors like the sextant’s “ribs of a dying bird” or the mountain of “forgotten things” are striking and coherent; there are few, if any, mixed images or paraphrase loops. Some cadences repeat and the prose occasionally brushes purple, but momentum is rarely impaired. This is comfortably publishable-level prose with room to tighten rhythm and restraint in a few places.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and purposeful, often doing double duty with image and theme. Figurative language is generally fresh and controlled (“vows…turned deciduous,” “skeletal rafters now heavy with peach blossoms”) without tipping into purple density. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum for this quiet mode is well maintained. A few lines flirt with abstraction, but they don’t materially obscure image or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, well-shaped, and pull double duty in mood and information. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and thematically apt (petals as fragments of time, fruit as memory). There is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; progression within paragraphs tends to add rather than restate. A few high-level abstractions could be trimmed for even greater sharpness, but they don’t materially slow momentum or cloud the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and generally high information density; most lines do at least two jobs (world, mood, character). Metaphors are mostly fresh and coherent, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few phrases nudge toward familiar (“her heart pounding,” “breath caught”), which slightly dull the edge at peak beats. Overall, line-level craft is strong enough for competitive venues, even if not yet singular.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and purposeful—most sentences carry more than one function (worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once). Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (names as flowers, fog as substance of memory) without stacking to the point of muddle. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the final lines land cleanly. A few favored adjectives and phrases repeat, but they read as motif rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm, clear sequencing, and high information density; nearly every sentence earns its place by advancing mood, concept, or plot. Figurative language is restrained and coherent, and there are few if any noticeable loops or scaffolding phrases. Occasional abstractions (“translating confusion into clarity,” “patterns of absence”) remain readable but are somewhat generic compared to the stronger concrete images. The closing cadence is clean and memorable, though a touch more compression or image-driven phrasing could deepen its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is clean, vivid, and economical: most sentences carry both image and function, and there’s little in the way of scaffolding, repetition, or muddled metaphor. The figurative language (“edges shimmering like a soap bubble,” “petals at dusk”) is clear, concrete, and not over-stacked; rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Action is easy to follow, with logical sequencing and no visible grammatical or usage slips. It’s strong, publication-ready craft, just shy of truly distinctive or formally ambitious work.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, metaphors are generally apt, and there is minimal redundancy or scaffold. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to blur sense; phrases like “its shards catching the dim light like frozen tears” are clear and in-tone. Information is packed efficiently, with worldbuilding, character, and theme often sharing lines. A few formulations flirt with familiar lyricism, but they don’t materially slow momentum or obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-by-line, the prose is controlled, image-rich, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding; most sentences are doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or characterization plus theme). Metaphoric density is high but not incoherent—fog as bridge, shadows as time, fossils as identity all interlock thematically rather than clashing. There are a few abstract statements that could be slightly sharpened into more concrete action or image, but they don’t stall momentum or blur the closure. Rhythm and syntax are varied and clean, with no noticeable loops or template cadences.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level writing is tight, with most sentences doing double duty in building atmosphere and character while moving the scene forward. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and metaphors are largely coherent and grounded in the fortress/fire motif. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; the prose reads fluidly without obvious syntactic templates or padding. A few turns of phrase flirt with the familiar (“her breath caught,” “hummed in your bones”), which slightly dulls the edge of an otherwise polished style.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and musical, rich with metaphor that generally feels apt (“grotto yawned open,” “trying to discover the texture of time”). Information density is high without redundancy; almost every sentence advances either atmosphere, character, or theme. The figurative language is frequent but rarely purple or muddled, and there are no evident loops or scaffolding lines dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most metaphors do multiple jobs at once, advancing character and atmosphere together. A few phrases edge toward self-consciousness or slight purple (“intangibly tangible,” “like honey left too long in the comb”), but they do not materially obscure sense or momentum. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; almost every line carries new information or charge. Overall, the prose sustains its lyric register with control, though a touch more restraint in figurative density could tighten the impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are clear, sentences are tight, and most lines do at least two jobs (advancing mood and character simultaneously). Repetition of motifs (storm glass, train whistle, silence) is patterned rather than looped, and there’s little scaffolding or synonym churn. A few aphoristic formulations risk slight abstraction, but they don’t significantly blunt clarity or momentum. The closing cadence is clean and musically aligned with earlier imagery, giving the piece a satisfying textual echo.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally tight, with strong sensory images (“colors bleeding into the air like ink in water”) and minimal redundancy; each paragraph advances setting or stakes. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically linked to light, glass, and paint, avoiding serious purple-prose muddle. There are no major syntactic glitches or clarity issues, and line-level rhythm supports a gradual descent-and-revelation feel. Some metaphors and formulations are conventional rather than cutting-edge, but they do not significantly dull momentum or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight and evocative, with strong lines like “its walls blackened by centuries of forgotten fires” and “creeping mold across a forgotten loaf of bread” doing layered work. Sentence rhythm varies and supports momentum; most lines carry both atmosphere and character. A few metaphors and repetitions (“She had not…” structures) flirt with overfamiliarity and mild scaffolding but don’t significantly drag clarity or pace. No major figurative muddle or redundancy touches the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is tight: sentences are varied, information-dense, and almost every line either advances the situation or deepens atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled and thematically coherent, with no mixed metaphors or purple overload, and the rhythm adapts well between eerie description and decisive action. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or clarity issues, especially around the closure beat. It stops short of extraordinary stylistic daring, but is fully publishable as-is at a major venue.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong sensory images and mostly efficient sentence-level work. There are mild redundancies and repeated intensifiers (“damning revelation” twice; paired “hadn’t fallen/been erased” and “hadn’t just been forgotten/silenced”) that slightly dull impact. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and aligned with the atmosphere, avoiding mixed metaphors that would blur meaning. Momentum holds through to closure without major scaffolding or syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences vary in rhythm, imagery is vivid, and most lines do double duty for mood and information. There is some tendency toward purple repetition of similar eerie qualifiers and an occasional cliché (“his heart a drumbeat in his chest”), but these do not significantly impede momentum or clarity. Figurative language remains coherent and legible during peak beats, with no major mixed-metaphor muddle. Trimming a few redundant intensifiers could elevate the prose further.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythm varies, and most lines carry more than one piece of work (character, atmosphere, or theme). A few phrases edge toward cliché or abstraction (“lives that had slipped through the cracks of history,” “weight of unknown histories”) and there is some conceptual repetition. Figurative language is not overstacked and rarely muddies meaning. Overall the prose is polished and readable, if slightly safer and more generalized than elite venues often demand.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight and musical, with strong images (“golden waters rippling like liquid fire,” “the system groaning under the weight of its own lies”) and minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Sentence variety and paragraphing keep momentum, and figurative language, while frequent, seldom confuses or contradicts itself. A few lines verge on familiar formulations or light purple (“old secrets,” “slow rot of too many promises”), keeping this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is generally excellent: dense but not cluttered, with images like “fractured into spectral shards by the mist” that carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, and thematic echo). Sentence rhythm varies well, there’s minimal redundancy, and figurative language is usually precise and coherent. The piece sustains a lyrical register without slipping into purple excess or losing clarity, including at the closing beats. A few stacked modifiers and abstractions (e.g., “something older, something like memory”) flirt with vagueness, but they don’t materially dull momentum or comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is polished: imagery like “ashen skyborne arbor” and “time when the air thickened with unspoken futures” is vivid yet controlled. Sentences tend to do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, mood, character) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and pattern-consistent, avoiding mixed metaphors or overwrought piling-on. A slight uniformity of lyrical intensity in all beats, including moments where sharper compression might heighten contrast, is the main constraint on an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally solid: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and free of obvious grammatical or structural glitches. The prose often does double duty, advancing scene while building atmosphere, and avoids heavy redundancy or template cadences. Some abstractions and coined phrases (“uncertainly certain,” “as if mocking the very concept”) edge toward conceptual vagueness and momentarily slow momentum. Nonetheless, information density is good for this length, and the final image is not dulled by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and dense with information; images like “foundry’s chimneys stood like skeletal fingers against the bruised twilight” are striking without fully tipping into muddle. There is some purple edging (“factually mystical,” “philosophy of scars,” “luminous with regret”) and thematic repetition that could be trimmed for even tighter momentum. Still, there are few true scaffolding lines or paraphrase loops, and the prose carries atmosphere and character simultaneously. The ending lands cleanly at the sentence level, even if it spells out theme a bit too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, images coherent, and most carry multiple functions (setting, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding. The figurative language leans lush but stops short of purple; metaphors like the note as a firefly and the sky as “spilled ink” cohere with the story’s luminous-ache tone. There are no real loops or redundant paraphrases dragging momentum. A few lines approach familiar lyric territory, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally tight, with high information density and evocative phrases that avoid mixed metaphors; the repeated ultraviolet and mathematical imagery forms a coherent lexicon. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most do at least two jobs (world-building plus interiority, or setting plus theme). There are a few slightly redundant formulations (“gift, or curse”; restating the mathematics-of-mercy premise) and occasional tell-y scaffolds that could be compressed, but they don’t significantly drag momentum. The closing paragraphs are clean and image-driven, with the final “knowing when to stop” line landing clearly rather than being obscured by prose.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without clear scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (sea, light, memory, anchoring). There’s minor risk of lushness tipping toward purple in places, yet clarity and momentum are never significantly impaired. The opening and final images are especially strong and well-cadenced.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied in length, and generally efficient, with images doing multiple jobs (e.g., dust as both physical detail and temporal sediment). Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The prose maintains momentum despite being descriptive and never muddies causality or image. It reads as polished and publication-ready, though not formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished: images are concrete (“books bound in translucent covers that caught the light like prisms”), sentences carry multiple functions, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but mostly clean and purposeful; only occasional phrases (“weight of eternity”) drift toward the familiar. Rhythm varies well, and momentum is maintained despite the lyrical density. No evident artifacts or muddled metaphors undercut the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is polished: strong verbs, precise images, and generally high information density with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language (“time made visible,” “ribs of some great beast”) is vivid and mostly controlled, enhancing rather than obscuring sense. There are a few familiar emotional formulations (“aching like an old wound,” “no joy in it”) and slightly lush moments, but they don’t materially drag momentum or blur causality. Rhythm varies enough to carry the reader through a largely expository premise without feeling sluggish.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory images (“brass walls etched with the scars of time,” “cloak woven from patches of twilight”) and mostly efficient sentences that carry both atmosphere and character. Rhythm varies naturally, and there are no major clarity issues or scaffold loops; momentum is maintained through the scene. A few lines lean toward abstraction or repetition (reusing “mending what wasn’t torn,” “covenant of rust” without deepening the imagery), but they don’t seriously blunt the closure. Overall line-level craft is above-average and publication-ready with minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are rhythmic, information-dense, and largely pull double duty for atmosphere and meaning. Figurative language is frequent but not chaotic; metaphors tend to be coherent and thematically aligned (memory, breath, machinery, silence). There are no substantial loops, syntactic monotony, or clarity issues, and the final line lands with precision. The density of imagery edges toward purple at times, but it doesn’t materially obscure the action or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, premise) and flow with good rhythm, and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are vivid and mostly coherent (“clawed the sky into tatters,” stones humming like turbines), with only occasional abstraction that doesn’t materially blur meaning. Pacing is steady; description rarely stalls movement, and transitions between beats are clean. It falls just shy of the highest tier because some lines drift toward decorative lyricism rather than pressure, but they don’t significantly dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and economical for its lyric mode, with most sentences doing at least two jobs (image plus emotion/theme). Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to muddy clarity, and metaphors (honeyed beams, umbral tenderness) are coherent and aligned with the mood. There are minor repetitions of tonal words (“quiet,” “hush”) and a faint tendency toward prettiness, but they don’t stall momentum or blur cause/effect. The opening and closing lines are strong anchors, each tying setting and theme in a clean image.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: varied sentence rhythms, vivid images like “sinkhole of glassy black water,” and high information density with little visible scaffolding. Description tends to carry multiple loads—worldbuilding, mood, and theme—with minimal redundancy, and action sequences remain clear. A couple of phrases drift toward cliché (“cold as a corpse’s touch”) or feel a touch on-the-nose, but they don’t materially blunt the closure. Overall, the prose supports momentum and atmosphere without lapsing into purple or repetitive structures.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with purposeful information; most sentences serve double duty in building atmosphere and character. Figurative language is generally clean and coherent, with no obvious mixed metaphors or redundancy loops. The narrative moves efficiently from setup to experiment to subtle payoff without scaffolding or filler. A few images are familiar (e.g., “mocking him with its silence”), but they don’t significantly dull the overall craft.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, with strong image choices (“the shape of his breath,” “the sound of the fruit’s surrender”) and good information density—most sentences do more than one job. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; it rarely tips into muddle or purple excess, even in peak beats. A slight tendency to restate omens or realizations (“It was an omen, he thought”) nudges the score down from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, clean syntax, and high information density with images often carrying multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme). Figurative language is generally precise and coherent within the ice/time motif. There are a few near-redundant conceptual statements (“not just its shape, but the grain of it, the friction” and the subsequent abstractions) that slightly slow momentum but don’t obscure causality or closure. Overall, the prose is polished and publishable, just shy of the absolute sharpness and compression of top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with most doing double duty (atmosphere plus character or stakes). Figurative language is fresh and coherent, and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or filler lines. The pacing is brisk yet unhurried, with paragraphing that supports shifts in pressure from calm observation to crisis. A slight tendency toward repeated structure in some explanatory lines is minor and does not notably dull momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images are mostly precise, and there is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, reinforcing the sacred/forgotten motif rather than drifting into decorative purple. Key beats (the alarms, the tracing of the star, the final stillness) are rendered with clarity and momentum despite the contemplative mode. A small tightening of a couple of abstract statements would further heighten impact but the prose already reads at near-publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms, minimal redundancy, and images that are vivid but not overstacked. Metaphors (e.g., ghosts “like candle flames in the dusk”) are coherent and tonally aligned; description pulls double duty for atmosphere and theme. There are a few mildly abstract phrases (“weight of the unspoken,” “world went silent”) that could be further particularized, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or clarity. Line-level execution is comfortably at publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, and nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Figurative language is frequent but usually apt and legible, with minimal paraphrase looping or scaffolding. Some images lean on well-worn formulations (“relentless sun,” “like honey,” “like sand”), and there’s mild purple-leaning density in places, but it doesn’t significantly slow momentum or blur causality. The final paragraph lands clearly and ties motifs together without textual clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is high: images are generally precise and non-redundant, and most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding. Figurative density is intense but controlled; metaphors like “woven dawns” and “burnished hush” cohere into a unified lexicon rather than piling up arbitrarily. A few phrases skirt purple, yet they do not obscure clarity or blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, mood). Image-work (“its surfaces etched by roots and time”; “pillars leaned toward one another like old friends”) is controlled and coherent. Repetitions like “The trees would remember” are purposeful rather than loop artifacts, supporting the close. There are no significant syntactic monotony or clarity issues, though a touch more compression in the middle could sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, concrete, and purposeful, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Imagery is consistent and not over-stacked; the metaphors (weight of skepticism, tower as crucible) are clear and non-muddled. There is minor thematic redundancy in explicitly naming the realizations, but no real paraphrase loops or template cadences that drag momentum. Overall, the prose reads cleanly at a level above most submissions.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and little to no scaffolding or paraphrase loops; metaphors are generally coherent and sensorial (“vastness so narrow it felt like a wound” is striking and apt). Figurative language is frequent but purposeful; it sustains mood without tipping into unreadable purple. Sentence and paragraph rhythms vary, supporting a gentle but continuous momentum toward the final image. It falls just short of top-tier because the line-level energy remains at one lush register throughout, without a sharper rhythmic inflection at the central decision beat.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, with varied rhythm and high information density; most images do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Metaphors are largely fresh and thematically linked (phonograph comparisons, carcass imagery), with little sign of synonym churn or scaffolding. The prose occasionally flirts with purple (“veins darkening like cracks in old bone”), but it remains legible and doesn’t obscure causality or closure. There are no notable loops or structural artifacts, and the final line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“frozen breath against the void,” stars as “lazy ribbons”) and good information density—most sentences do more than one job. Rhythm varies well and there is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; exposition is folded into scene smoothly. At moments the language edges toward purple, but metaphors remain legible and non-contradictory, so clarity and momentum are not harmed. Overall, this is well above typical submission quality at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and generally efficient, with images like “its jagged silhouette cutting through the wrongness of the sky” and “figure woven from frost and starlight” doing multiple jobs. There is little scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances mood, world, or character. Metaphors are consistent with the world’s logic and rarely feel overwrought. The prose is strong and publication-ready at many venues, though it doesn’t quite reach the level of startling, line-by-line originality seen at the most rarefied markets.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and emotion) with little redundancy, and rhythm varies to keep the paragraph flow alive. Figurative language is rich but mostly precise, with recurring metaphors (breath, penumbra, absence) forming a clear pattern rather than a jumble. There are no obvious scaffolding lines or synonym loops; nearly every sentence earns its place. A few formulations (“luminous absence,” “benevolently ruthless”) flirt with mannerism, but they’re supported by context rather than left as decorative abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are economical yet rich, and most metaphors (mountain as forgotten god, stone as second heart) are coherent and reinforcing rather than stacked for show. There’s good information density; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, world, or character. The prose flirts with purple at times, but avoids true muddle, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding artifacts. A bit more alternation between highly figurative lines and plainer, cutting ones could sharpen pivotal beats even further.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is tight, rhythmically varied, and generally high-density: description almost always does double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“air hum like a plucked harp string,” “woven hush”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled; images are consistent and don’t muddle each other. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and sentences move the story forward rather than circling. A couple of metaphors skirt the edge of lushness, but they don’t slow momentum or obscure action.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and multitasking: description frequently carries emotional and thematic charge (“the air hummed with the weight of unspoken apologies”). Metaphors are frequent but mostly coherent and tonally aligned, and sentence rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. There is some flirtation with purple prose and conceptual repetition around silence/forgiveness that could be pared back for even sharper impact. Nonetheless, clarity remains high and the final image is cleanly delivered without line-level muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs, advancing mood, character, and world without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is dense but controlled and thematically unified (acid, breath, metal, gold) rather than scattershot; there are few if any mixed metaphors. Repetitions around “acid sea,” “pockmarks,” and “scars” mostly feel deliberate and pattern-building. A minor tightening of a few near-paraphrased emotional statements (“conjure meaning / make sense of the fragments”) would further sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, tight paragraphs, and images that usually do double duty (e.g., algae as “slow heartbeats” connects environment and mortality). Prose stays clear even when figurative, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. The lyric density stops short of purple, maintaining momentum through the discovery beats. A few abstractions (e.g., “something like forgiveness”) could be grounded more, but they don’t blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and images typically carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without clutter. Figurative language (“the storm’s hunger,” “dawn bled,” “the world forgot how to breathe”) is frequent but disciplined, rarely tipping into mixed metaphors or redundancy. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase, and the prose maintains momentum even while being contemplative. A few lines edge toward familiar lyric phrasing, but none materially blur causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied rhythm, generally high information density, and vivid yet comprehensible imagery. Figurative language (“geography of loss,” “stars still sing”) is frequent but not so stacked as to become purple or obscure causality. There are mild abstractions and a few lines that rephrase prior points, but no significant loops or artifacts that sap momentum. The final paragraph in particular is clean, concrete, and thematically loaded without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that generally pull more than one weight (world, mood, and theme at once). Figurative language is frequent but rarely purple; metaphors like “the hanging orchard clung…like a desperate thought” and “the orchard’s roots wrapping around her ankles like chains” are coherent and character-inflected. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and momentum is maintained despite reflective passages. The only minor limitation is an occasional tendency to restate insights in more abstract terms near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme), and avoid obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent—images like mist as “ghostly fingers” and memories as a “tuning fork” hum feel of a piece. There’s minimal redundancy, and syntax supports the gradual, meditative pacing without bogging down. This is close to elite-magazine ready prose with only minor risk of tonal sameness at moments.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “ink faded to the color of old tea” and blossoms that “pulsed like slow heartbeats” are evocative without sliding into purple prose. Sentences generally do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and character, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym churn. A few phrases lean on familiar templates (“for the first time in years, Elias felt something akin to hope”), slightly dulling the otherwise distinctive texture. Overall, information density and momentum remain high and the closure image is clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, and most images pull double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is a high density of figurative language, but metaphors are coherent and do not collapse into purple muddle; phrases like “the cosmos had sewn itself into her flesh” are strong and legible. Scaffolding, repetition, and informational padding are minimal. The main limit is that the sustained lyricism sometimes flattens dynamic contrast, but it doesn’t impede clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, metaphor largely coherent, and nearly every line carries either character, world, or thematic weight. Phrases like “polished by time” and “where the last light of day pooled like molten copper” are evocative without obscuring sense. There is a mild tendency toward density of figurative language, but it stops short of purple and does not blur causality or the closure image. No clear scaffolding, loops, or mechanical cadence issues appear.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, and character all at once), and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. The figurative language is generally coherent and evocative; a few metaphors edge toward density (“feral nostalgia,” “the mountain’s teeth”) but remain legible and thematically aligned. There’s minimal padding, and syntax shifts appropriately with pressure, though the overall lushness approaches purple at moments and could be tightened slightly without losing effect.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, figurative language is mostly fresh (“like a forgotten promise,” “mapping…a moment”), and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundancy. Information density is high; nearly every line does double duty in atmosphere and character. A few phrases lean familiar (“eyes that had seen too much and not enough”), but they don’t materially dull momentum or clarity. The closing image is clean and resonant without being overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, largely free of redundancy, and carry multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, centered on storms, ink, scars, and breath in a way that builds a pattern rather than a clutter. Occasional explicit interpretive phrases slightly dull the mystery but do not materially harm momentum or clarity. The final cadence with the glowing rune and first raindrop lands musically and precisely.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms, strong verbs, and images that tend to do double duty for character and atmosphere (“a waltz that sounded like falling,” “a scent…like lightning”). Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to blur sense, and mixed metaphors are avoided; each motif (music, static, scent, weather) is carried consistently. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the narrative moves forward with each paragraph, particularly once the coil appears. The only arguable limit is a slight stylistic saturation—nearly every paragraph contains a vivid image—which might be trimmed in a house edit for even sharper impact.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: many sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) with relatively little redundancy. Imagery is often striking (“shelves stretching into the dim like the ribs of a forgotten god”; “its fabric stuttering like a broken clock”) and avoids mixed metaphors. There is some tendency toward repeated constructions and abstract nouns, but not enough to seriously impede momentum or clarity. The final paragraphs maintain clarity despite high abstraction, and there are no obvious scaffolding artifacts or syntactic stumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is dense, precise, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding; most sentences carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, world) without clogging. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically unified—whalebone, tide, foam, and underwater bells all orbit the same sensory/metaphoric field. Rhythm flexes to support pressure, and there are no significant loops or syntactic tics that dull momentum. A few abstractions (“something eminently peculiar,” “something else”) could be sharpened, but they don’t materially harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty for mood and character. Figurative language (“quiet wildfire,” “the silent algebra of trespass”) is vivid and mostly well-chosen, with only minor risk of edging into purple but never enough to blur sense or momentum. There are no notable repetition loops, syntactic templates, or clarity slips, and the final image lands clearly. It reads as ready for high-level publication with only marginal tightening, not structural prose surgery.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with a good balance of sentence lengths and a strong ear for rhythm. Most images do double duty—advancing mood and character—without slipping into overwrought ornamentation. There are occasional slightly showy phrases (“clover melancholy”) that flirt with preciousness but don’t materially slow momentum or confuse. Information density is high, scaffolding is minimal, and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, precise, and high-information: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme without scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is sparing and apt, with no mixed metaphors or purple density. The final lines land cleanly and recharge earlier motifs without over-explaining. It’s not stylistically baroque, but the control and economy are on par with strong literary journals.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory specificity and minimal scaffolding or repetition; most sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, theme) efficiently. Figurative language (“steep into his skin,” “the jetty bloomed around him”) is mostly coherent and not overstacked. There are a few mildly generic phrases and conceptual restatements of the same insight, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lean yet lush, with images like “ivy that spilled like green waterfalls” and the moon rock as “a shard of frozen starlight” doing multiple jobs—world-building, mood, and characterization. Sentence rhythms vary nicely and there’s little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or strained metaphor. Information density is high without sacrificing clarity, and the closing lines land with clean, unfussy force. It’s very strong line-level work, just shy of utterly distinctive brilliance.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: clean syntax, purposeful metaphors, and generally high information density with little scaffolding or redundancy. Occasional phrases flirt with abstraction or mild purple (“center of all uncharted emotional depths,” “quiet blaze of the clearing”), but they don’t significantly blur meaning. The rhythm balances longer lyric lines with shorter, anchoring statements, and there are no serious loops or mixed metaphors. A slight tightening—pruning a few near-duplicate formulations about song/emotion—would sharpen momentum to a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, with varied sentence rhythms and generally high information density—most lines advance character, world, or theme simultaneously. Metaphors (second moon, bruise-colored smear, garden of weeds) are apt and not overstacked, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. The piece balances lyricism and clarity well, keeping momentum through interiority and dialogue without bogging down. It falls just shy of elite-level precision or surprise at the line, but there are no notable artifacts or muddles.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with mostly clean metaphors (“words curling into the night like smoke”) and a good balance between lyricism and clarity. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and description generally does double duty for atmosphere and emotion. There is minor redundancy (e.g., variations on silence and light) but not enough to stall momentum or blur sense. The final lines land with a clear, charged image rather than abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences are generally tight, varied, and purposeful; there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and information density is respectable. Some emotional shorthand (“breath hitching,” “pulse quickened,” “breath came shallow”) and repeated body beats lean on genre defaults rather than fresher embodiment. Figurative language is used sparingly and mostly lands; nothing crucial is obscured by purple prose or muddled metaphor. The final lines strike a clear, uncluttered cadence that supports the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally lean and propulsive, with most sentences doing double duty (advancing both atmosphere and plot). Rhythm varies well between long, flowing lines in reflective moments and shorter ones under pressure (“The restraints snapped. / He didn’t remember moving…”). There are a few slightly stock formulations and repeated images (“liquid starlight”/“liquid silver,” “like the world holding its breath”), but they don’t significantly muddy sense or momentum. No noticeable scaffold loops or template cadences bog down the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are generally sharp, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn. Figurative language ("choir of the lost," "map…like scars") is frequent but mostly apt and not so dense as to blur clarity. The prose maintains momentum while embedding backstory efficiently. I see no artifacts that obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clear imagery, and generally fresh metaphors that don’t pile up to the point of muddling sense. Phrases like “bruised evening sky” and “footsteps echoing like a half-spoken secret” are evocative without feeling overworked. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and each paragraph tends to do multiple jobs (setting, character, theme) efficiently. The occasional slightly on-the-nose line is more a tonal choice than a craft flaw, and momentum is well sustained for a quiet piece.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong sensory images and minimal redundancy; sentences typically do more than one job. Metaphors are mostly clean and coherent, though there is some clustering of big abstractions and “wise” formulations that feel a touch ornamental. Rhythm varies nicely, and there are no major loops, template cadences, or confusing constructions. The language is stylish and publishable but not yet at the razor-sharp, nothing-extra level of top-tier pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and musical, with high information density and minimal redundancy (“the air thick with salt and the low groan of moored ships” is typical of the clean, evocative phrasing). Figurative language is selective and controlled; it rarely feels purple or overstacked, and it almost always pulls its weight for mood or theme. There are a handful of abstract phrases (“old grief,” “world’s cruelty,” “true nature”) that are slightly thinner than the surrounding concrete imagery, but they don’t seriously blunt momentum or clarity. The final image sequence (blank bone, distant foreman, whale-song in her bones) lands clearly and cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: metaphors are mostly clean and apt (“blades slicing the sky,” “petals brittle as old bone”), and sentences often do double duty for mood and character. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances atmosphere or interior state. Rhythm shifts appropriately between longer, meditative sentences and sharper, declarative ones around key images. A few familiar phrases aside, the prose is controlled, economical, and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is polished, with many sentences doing double duty—advancing atmosphere and interior state simultaneously. Metaphors (e.g., “sharp as a line break,” “lantern-moth hush”) are generally apt and controlled, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. The density of figurative language approaches purple in places, but it rarely muddies clarity or momentum in this reflective mode. Minor tightening of a few similarly structured, image-heavy sentences could raise the score further.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is smooth, rhythmic, and largely economical, with images like “a sound like a sigh escaping a sleeping mouth” doing multiple jobs. Occasional phrases (“hummed with possibility,” “knew too much for her age”) tread close to cliché but don’t dominate. Sentences vary in length and structure, and most lines advance either character or atmosphere without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is present but not so dense or mixed as to blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and generally economical, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“the way sound could split into something beautiful, just as light did through glass”). Figurative language is consistent and thematically aligned (fracture, vibration, light), and there are few, if any, mechanical or clarity issues. A couple of lines verge on redundancy or abstraction, but they do not significantly drag momentum. The cadence of paragraphs supports the gentle escalation toward the hum and realization.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting and character (“her half-finished pieces left like accusations”). Figurative language is generally apt and not over-stacked, and there’s little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or mechanical cadence. Pacing is efficient for the length; transitions between locations are brisk but legible. A few phrases border on purple or familiar (e.g., “vanished into the twilight like a breath”), which keeps this just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, images are controlled (“measuring tape, coiled like a sleeping serpent”), and most metaphors are coherent and purposeful. Information density is high without obvious scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. There is some risk of metaphor crowding (strata/blueprint/constellations) but it doesn’t tip into muddle, and clarity is preserved through the ending. The final exchange of texts is clean and lands with a precise, unsettling snap.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density—lines often do double duty in establishing mood and advancing the situation. Images like “atoms of nostalgia” and “a sound like a thousand voices sighing” are striking and thematically aligned, not random ornament. There is some risk of purple prose, but metaphors remain coherent and recur with purpose, avoiding muddle or obvious loops. Momentum is maintained throughout, and the final image of the walls dissolving into light provides a clean, charged cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is clean, with strong image economy (“a shadow unbound,” “pooled in corners like spilled ink,” “the sky bruised from blue to violet”) and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, and metaphors largely cohere tonally and logically with the world. Sentence rhythm supports the slow, deliberate mood without becoming monotonous or syntactically templated. There are no noticeable clarity lapses or loops that dull the closure beat, and the final lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, economical, and often do multiple jobs at once (advancing action, revealing character, and building atmosphere). Figurative language (“mist curled like smoke,” “shimmering stillness”) is controlled and not over-stacked; there’s little redundancy or scaffold. A few phrases flirt with familiar lyricism, but they rarely bog momentum or obscure sense. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final image is crisp and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are lean yet evocative, with metaphors (“sand…like shattered glass,” tower’s groan as a released breath) that are clear and unforced. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, mood, and character simultaneously without visible scaffolding or summary loops. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to become purple, and it remains coherent with the story’s internal physics and emotional texture. The closing lines are especially well-calibrated, landing on a clean, charged image without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences tend to do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious redundancy, and metaphors (“like the shudder of a held note finally released”) largely cohere and stay on motif. There is some density of figurative language but it rarely feels purple or muddled, and rhythm adapts to quieter and more intense moments. No clear scaffold, loops, or mechanical cadences drag momentum. A few abstractions (“a vast, echoing cavity”) brush against vagueness but are grounded quickly enough by context.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level writing is polished and often beautiful (“fragments of forgotten songs, the sighs of dying stars, the laughter of comets” is emblematic), with strong sensory nouns and verbs. However, figurative density is high and sometimes borders on purple, with occasional redundancy (e.g., multiple restatements of blocked creativity and stardust as inspiration) that could be tightened. The climax leans on abstraction (“trapped creativity surged, breaking free”) rather than one or two sharply dramatized images of change. Even so, clarity is never lost and momentum, though gentle, does not stall.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally lean, rhythmic, and clear, with a good balance between sentence lengths and a lack of obvious scaffolding or loops. Most metaphors are concrete and apt, and paragraphs tend to do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). A few lines veer into pseudo-profound abstraction or prompt echo (“wave functions—through the ripples of what was and what could be”), slightly thinning immediacy. Line-level craft is strong enough for publication but not yet in the near-flawless range expected at elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and largely free of redundancy, with metaphors that are vivid yet mostly disciplined (“their edges blurring like ink in water” is a good example). Information density is high without sacrificing clarity, and there are few, if any, scaffolding phrases or loops. While the prose does lean heavily into lyricism, the imagery remains coherent and doesn’t collapse into mixed metaphors or purple excess. Momentum is modest but appropriate for an accumulative, contemplative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and rhythmically controlled, with several strong images (the water as “shoreline lullaby,” the star stamp glowing, lanterns and shadows “like memories”). Sentences generally carry more than one function—advancing mood, character, and world together—without visible scaffolding or loops. There is some reliance on quasi-epigrammatic statements that slightly dilute immediacy, but figurative language remains coherent and not over-stacked. No major syntax or clarity issues impede momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: vivid images (“towers clawing at the twilight,” “seraphically mundane blend”) and generally efficient syntax push both atmosphere and information without obvious scaffolding or loops. Rhythm varies well, and most metaphors are clean and consistent with the established tone. A few phrases edge toward purple but don’t materially blur clarity or drag momentum. The final lines, in particular, are crisp and well-weighted.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and few wasted lines; images typically do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once). Metaphors are mostly apt and sustained without obvious mixing, and syntax is varied enough to keep the rhythm alive. There is some flirtation with purple density—several consecutive figurative flourishes in low-pressure moments—but clarity and momentum are rarely compromised. Tightening a handful of decorative phrases would elevate already strong line craft to a more austere, elite-literary register.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is largely economical and vivid, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and story, and little scaffolding or repetition beyond a few deliberate callbacks (“She had come here…”). Rhythm varies between longer, dreamy sentences (the dream, the station’s stillness) and tighter, investigative beats, maintaining momentum without rush. Figurative language is generally apt and not overstacked; clarity remains high, particularly around key discoveries. A touch more syntactic risk or compression at peak beats could push it higher, but it’s already publication-ready at many venues.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and largely efficient, multi-tasking lines that advance mood, character, and world simultaneously. Metaphors like “dying light pooled in the corners like spilled mercury” and “thunderous serenity” are striking yet legible, and figurative density is high without tipping into incoherence. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and action sequencing is clear. A few formulations gesture toward purple, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (e.g., “each one a map of time,” “the words coiled around her thoughts like the steam”) is coherent and well controlled, avoiding purple excess. There are no notable loops or template cadences, and the final paragraphs land with a clear, charged image. A touch more syntactic variation or a sharper compression at moments of highest pressure could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lean yet vivid, with most sentences doing multiple jobs: advancing mood, character, and theme simultaneously (e.g., the opening image of the arboretum “clung to the seaside cliff like a stubborn dream”). Rhythm varies well between longer, sinuous lines and shorter, grounded beats, especially around the drones’ arrival. Figurative language is purposeful and not overstacked, with recurring images (pearls, roots, glass, sea) coherently developed. Minor repetitions of structure (“She didn’t believe in…”) read as deliberate patterning rather than scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level writing is strong, with varied sentence rhythm and generally high information density; most sentences serve multiple functions (mood, character, and motion). There are a few familiar or slightly purple touches (“like a blade,” “drowning in slow motion”), but they don’t accumulate enough to blunt clarity or momentum. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly controlled, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The closure beat is cleanly rendered and not obscured by metaphor overload.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level writing is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with metaphor used judiciously. The opening image and closing cadence are both effective and clean, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. A few moments lean toward slightly purple (“his albino eyes burning with serene anger,” “like liquid shadow”) and some adjectives could be trimmed without loss. These do not materially obscure causality or dull the ending, but they keep the piece just shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“vials of voices, petrified emotions, contraband truths smuggled across time”). Figurative language is mostly precise and thematically aligned, with no significant mixed metaphors or clutter; the snow and silence motifs are repeated but not overworked. There’s very little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and transitions between beats are smooth. A few aphoristic turns risk feeling slightly on-the-nose, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure image, so they register as minor rather than structural issues.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are generally tight and musical, with varied rhythms and strong image work (“air tasted of rust,” “petals trembled in his calloused hand”). Most lines do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and character without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. There is some mild adjective and metaphor stacking (“tranquil blazes,” “fragile enclosure”) but it remains coherent and doesn’t obscure sense or momentum. The ending cadence is clean, with no line-level muddle dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level craft is polished, with mostly lean, purposeful sentences that carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, and character) simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt (“silver reeds bending in the wind like the ribs of a sleeping giant”), and there’s little paraphrase looping or scaffolding bloat. Rhythm modulates well between calm description and heightened moments, helping the climax land clearly. A few phrases (“soothed and terrified in equal measure,” some repetition of “he had heard the old stories”) lean slightly generic, preventing this from reaching the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty (advancing mood and character alongside plot). Metaphors (“constellation of lies,” “orbits of regret”) are coherent and thematically apt rather than piled on for ornament; there’s lyric richness without sustained purple excess. I see little scaffolding or synonym looping, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. A touch more restraint in a few figurative turns might heighten impact further, but line-level control is already strong and never obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty in tone and story. Figurative language is frequent but mostly well-chosen and coherent, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. Momentum is maintained despite reflective passages because each memory or detail actively re-angles the present pressure. The only modest limitation is that the density of imagery sometimes flirts with purple without quite crossing into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: images like “pastel hues that dissolved into the mist like forgotten dreams” and the hush as “swollen with the things people had stopped saying” do multiple jobs at once. Syntax and paragraphing support momentum without cluttering the page with scaffolding or repetition. Figurative density is high but not so overstuffed that it obscures action or causality, and there are no obvious mixed metaphors or loops. A touch more variance between highly figurative lines and a few plainer anchor sentences at peak beats could heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: images tend to be clear, layered, and efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and character. Occasional phrases (“lodged in her ribs like a splinter,” “heart a quiet furnace of defiance”) lean toward familiar lyric territory but are executed cleanly and don’t clog momentum. Repetition around naming and mercy reads intentional rather than like scaffold or synonym churn. The final paragraph lands with a precise, quiet cadence that suits the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with metaphors like “something that tasted like lightning on his tongue” and the pond-reflection fracture doing multiple jobs at once. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to obscure clarity, and sentence structure has healthy variety. There’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot simultaneously. A few phrases veer toward familiar (“her laughter ringing like bells”), but they don’t materially dull the closure image or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density—most lines advance both atmosphere and character. Imagery like “jagged edge fractally precise” and “the paint shimmered…a living map of her body’s memory” feels fresh without tumbling into incoherent purple. There are no noticeable loops, scaffold sentences, or syntactic ruts, and the final image is clean and charged. Occasionally a metaphor (“willowglass hope”) is more aesthetic than functional, but it doesn’t blur sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically aware, and dense with information without devolving into clutter. Figurative language (“towers crumbling into the sea like forgotten teeth,” “silhouette woven from the same glowing mist”) is mostly precise and thematically aligned, with minimal mixed metaphors. Prose rarely loops or restates, and exposition about the grandmother and transitional objects is compact and purposeful. There is some stacking of imagery in high-pressure beats, but it stays legible and does not obscure action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and information-dense; most sentences do multiple jobs (image, atmosphere, and interiority) without bloat. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically aligned (unraveling, spools, captured sunset), and there are few if any paraphrase loops or filler transitions. Syntax varies and reads smoothly aloud, with no noticeable artifacts or logic slips. A handful of metaphors (“spin the prophecy into raw possibility”) edge toward abstraction, but they do not significantly drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally lean and purposeful, with strong sensory images and metaphors that rarely feel strained, and nearly every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Rhythm varies nicely between long, imagistic lines and shorter, declarative pivots (“It was a choice.”), giving the piece good read-aloud cadence. There is some repetition of thematic constructions (courage, fixing what’s broken, tilt toward spring) and a touch of aphoristic overtness, but not enough to drag momentum or blur clarity. Line-level control at the ending is especially strong, with the pillbox left on the desk and the lifted mist composing a clean, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong images ("the fog clung to the river like a shroud," "the gutters... began to tick like a metronome") and generally efficient sentences that advance mood and character together. There is some purple tendency ("spindrift serenity," "the storm’s fingers picking at its strands"), but figurative density doesn’t overwhelm clarity or momentum. Redundancies and template cadences are minimal; most lines do more than one job. The final image is clean and resonant, not dulled by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most images carry more than one job (world, mood, and theme at once). Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and legible; “as chimney smoke flattens into the sky” neatly anticipates the later smoke image. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and syntax remains clear despite the lyrical mode. A few lines edge toward familiar lyricism, but they don’t materially drag momentum or muddle the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft is generally clean, with varied sentence structures and a good balance between image and forward motion. Some phrasing leans toward the familiar or slightly purple (“reflecting light into dark corners,” “luminous promise of the sea”), and the final paragraph nudges into thematic redundancy. Still, there are no significant loops, mixed metaphors, or clarity issues, and most sentences carry multiple jobs efficiently. The prose is solidly publishable, though a light tightening of abstractions and on-the-nose lines would sharpen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty in worldbuilding and character (“She had spent years translating isolation into independence…”). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and most metaphors are coherent and grounded in the story’s materials (tides, stone, light, reflection). There is some conceptual repetition around isolation/independence and the past vs. present, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum. Line-level clarity is high, with no notable syntactic clutter or confusion, and the final image is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for image and character. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and pattern-based (lotus, spirals, mirrors) rather than decorative sprawl. Occasional flourishes (“whimsy so inevitable it felt like gravity”) skate close to preciousness but do not obscure sense or drag momentum. There are no evident scaffolding loops, syntactic monotony, or clarity failures, and the final lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences are generally clean, rhythmic, and efficient, with concrete verbs and minimal redundancy. Figurative language is sparing and coherent, and most lines perform multiple jobs (world, emotion, and stakes) without feeling padded. There are a few mild clichés (“world on the brink,” “powder keg”) and some conceptual repetition around division and hope, but they don’t significantly drag momentum. The final paragraphs land clearly and musically without scaffold or muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and mostly lean despite its lyricism; images like “starlight… painted silver veins across the stone floor” are vivid and specific. There are very few redundancies or scaffold phrases, and sentence rhythms vary enough to keep the piece moving. Metaphors are generally coherent and apt, with limited purple drift that doesn’t obscure sense. Information density is high for this length, and the final lines land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythm is varied, and images like the mist “curling around their boots like smoke” work well without tipping into excess. There’s some mild repetition and phrasing that states what’s already implied (e.g., thematic lines about empathy), but not enough to significantly drag momentum. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and action order is easy to follow. Line-level craft is publishable with only light tightening rather than structural overhaul.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: vivid metaphors (“new sky,” “spongey dread”) feel mostly fresh and coherent, and sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, and character) without padding. Rhythm is varied and readable, with no obvious template cadences or synonym loops. Exposition is efficiently woven into action and reflection, maintaining momentum in a short span. A few metaphoric phrasings verge on self-conscious, but they don’t materially obscure clarity or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images are largely coherent, and most lines do double duty for mood and character. Figurative language is frequent, edging toward lush, but remains internally consistent and rarely feels strained. Momentum is maintained despite reflection, helped by concrete sensory anchors and clean syntax. A slightly high metaphor density in places keeps it just below the very top tier, but there are no major artifacts or loops dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with very little scaffolding or redundancy, and images like “a beast too weary to move” or “each bill told a story of distant lands” work well. Figurative language is present but not so thick as to feel purple, and paragraphs progress with good momentum for a reflective piece. There are no noticeable loops, clumsy metaphors, or syntactic monotony, and the final lines land crisply. The prose is excellent if slightly safe; an occasional sharper, more surprising turn of phrase could push it into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong—lyrical but readable, with some memorable images (temple inscriptions as “living things,” “flower blooming in reverse”). Sentence rhythm varies and most lines do at least two jobs (setting tone while advancing interior stakes). Occasionally the language verges on purple or redundant (“The burden was theirs to carry, but not alone. / Not anymore.”), but these choices still function rhetorically. Figurative density stays coherent; there are no mixed metaphors or structural artifacts that obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, character) with minimal padding, and images are striking without devolving into purple prose. Metaphors (fruit like “wet teeth,” scars as “rivers of old battles”) are coherent and grounded in the scene’s physicality. There’s little synonym churn or looping; progression from line to line is clear and propulsive. A few abstractions (“the thing beneath them—the frozen confession”) skate close to telling, but they’re quickly anchored by specific, consequential action.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and generally well-paced, with a strong ear for rhythm and an effective blend of sentence lengths. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, sustaining a unified aesthetic rather than devolving into muddle. A few metaphors and abstractions verge on purple or familiar (“like a bruise,” “something ancient and hungry”), and density sometimes risks dampening immediacy. Even so, clarity remains high and there’s little in the way of scaffolding or repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density—most lines advance mood, world, and character simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent; metaphors (orchard as lung/ledger) are thematically aligned rather than decorative clutter. There are no evident loops, scaffold sentences, or clarity breaks, and the opening and closing images are both sharp. The occasional stacked abstraction (“dusky resolve,” “threadbare patience”) could be pared, but they do not materially slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: clear syntax, economical description, and images that usually do two jobs at once (worldbuilding plus interiority). A few metaphors verge on the familiar (“pit yawned like an open wound,” “ghost in the mix”), and there are occasional slightly redundant beats (“Of course it was just the wind. But then he heard it again…”), but they don’t significantly drag momentum or clarity. Overall, the prose has good propulsion, high information density, and no notable artifacts or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level work is polished: varied syntax, few if any redundant sentences, and metaphors that are largely clear and well chosen. Figurative language (“haunted ambitions,” “shape—a figure woven from light”) enhances rather than obscures sense, and rhythm alternates between long, meditative sentences and shorter, emphatic ones in a way that fits the mood. There are occasional abstractions (“haunted ambitions lingering in the air”) that could be grounded in more concrete perception, but they do not meaningfully drag momentum or clarity. Overall, the prose demonstrates control and economy without noticeable scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight and evocative, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“its salt-laced exhales misting the air like the sigh of a sleeping giant” simultaneously grounds the setting and mood). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and aligned with the sea–mechanism imagery, rarely sliding into mixed-metaphor confusion. There’s little obvious scaffolding or repetitive synonym churn, and information unfolds with good density for the length. A few lines border on purple or explanatory (“His motivation was simple...”), but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: much of the prose carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding, and images like “confessions etched inside a seashell’s spiral” or “boots crunching on shattered quartz” are vivid without being muddled. Figurative density is high but mostly controlled; a few phrases (“prismatic whispers,” “reliquary of what could have been”) flirt with purple yet remain legible and on-theme. Sentences flow well aloud, with varied openings and clear sequencing of action. There are no major loops or artifacts dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (image, theme, emotion) without obvious redundancy, and the metaphors are coherent and well-matched to rivers, maps, and decay. Figurative density is high but not so stacked as to become purple or obscure meaning, and there are no noticeable loops or filler scaffolding. The prose maintains clarity through reflection, with clean syntax and punctuation. The final images (ivy whispering, walking toward the river) efficiently reweight prior details.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a good balance between image and clarity; most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus theme, or atmosphere plus interiority). Metaphoric density is high but mostly coherent and pattern-driven (time as loop, library as process, echoes/delays), avoiding muddle. There is little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or template cadence, and the final image (still watch at midnight) is clean and strong. A bit of abstract phrasing around realizations could be sharpened, but it doesn’t significantly blunt momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is tight, with a high information density: most sentences advance both atmosphere and stakes without padding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and thematically coherent (ice, cracks, unraveling), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple-clogged beats. Rhythm modulates well between slower descriptive openings and sharper, shorter lines as the confrontation peaks. A few explanatory clauses could be pared back for even more sting, but they don’t notably drag momentum or obscure action.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty for mood and meaning. There is some mild repetition of concepts (threshold, spark, aurora hush) and a tendency toward ornate phrasing that nudges into purple but does not obscure clarity. Figurative language is mostly coherent and thematically aligned, though “a thousand fractured dreams” is more decorative than precise. Momentum is appropriate for a lyric piece; nothing crucial is buried or needlessly scaffolded.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and structure, images are generally precise, and most lines do at least two jobs (advancing setting and character or theme together). A few formulations edge toward expository explanation of theme, but there’s little true redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with no major mixed metaphors or rhythm artifacts that impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, economical, and typically pull double duty for mood and characterization (“the wind tugging at the fabric like an impatient creditor” is emblematic). Metaphors and motifs recur with intention, and there is little to no paraphrase looping or scaffolding. A few phrases lean toward familiar abstraction (“cloak of doubt,” “messy, beautiful uncertainty”), but they don’t significantly blunt clarity or momentum. Overall, information density and rhythm support rather than compete with the scene’s quiet tension.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, sensory density is high without drowning sense, and most lines do more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once). The piece avoids obvious loops or filler; progression from sentence to sentence feels purposeful and propulsive for a lyric mode. Some phrases flirt with purple (“tethered…by the invisible threads of gravity and time,” recurrent “whispers” and “hush”), and the “teach vanishing to appear” formulation is slightly opaque, but these do not seriously impede clarity or closure. Tightening a few repetitive images and trimming overtly ornamental language would polish it further.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with high information density and largely efficient metaphor (“their calls weaving through the echoes like threads through cloth”). Figurative language is frequent but coherent; it sustains a consistent image system (bone, dust, sound, cloth) rather than degenerating into ornament. There’s little obvious scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. At times the lyricism slightly smooths over urgency, but it doesn’t obscure cause/effect or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and economical; most sentences carry at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus interiority). Images like the sky of fishlike stars and the mist that is “not wet, but alive” are vivid without tipping into muddle. There are a few familiar phrases (“loomed above the clouds,” “breath fogging the air”) and mild repetition in structure, but no significant loops or purple-stacked metaphors that drag momentum. Line-level control supports, rather than competes with, the story’s emotional movement.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely free of scaffolding or loops; most sentences earn their place by doing at least two jobs (image + mood, or action + interiority). Figurative language is controlled and coherent—“ribs of a dead whale,” “meteor hush”—without tipping into purple excess. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to maintain momentum, and there are no clarity-breaking artifacts. It’s polished and publishable, if not formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is high: images like “light trapped in the glass like insects in honey” and “the universe had contracted once already, folding in on itself like a dying breath” are vivid and controlled. Sentences usually do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without padding, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or paraphrase-looping. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to blur sense, and metaphors stay coherent with the established cosmic frame. Minor abstractions (“meaning was slippery now”) are the only soft spots, and they don’t materially dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but controlled, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent yet rarely feels muddled or mixed, and there’s little to no synonym churn or scaffolding repetition. The prose sustains momentum in a largely interior, lyric piece, and the final sentence lands cleanly. A hint of purple excess in places keeps it out of the absolute top band, but not by much.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and economical, with images like “arches humming with the last echoes of a world that had forgotten how to sing” and “light pooled like spilled ink” doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but coherent; metaphors align (sound, water, cracks, silence) and rarely feel strained or redundant. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and sentences vary in length and structure enough to keep the ear engaged. A slightly high metaphor density in places flirts with lushness but doesn’t obscure clarity or dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, largely concise, and often perform multiple functions (setting mood, revealing character, advancing plot) at once. Figurative language is mostly apt and controlled, with a few slightly familiar constructions but no major mixed metaphors or rhythm-breaking purple patches. There is little scaffolding or redundancy; information density is high without becoming opaque. A final pass to trim a handful of abstract formulations and ensure every metaphor is as fresh as the best ones would make this fully competitive at the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, evocative, and multi-functional, often advancing both image and interiority without padding. Metaphors (“each one catching the light like a captured star”) are vivid yet rarely overstacked, and there is little obvious scaffolding or synonym looping. The prose walks close to purple in places, but the density feels deliberate and in keeping with a contemplative, magical setting rather than indiscriminate ornament. Information flows smoothly, and both opening and closing lines land with a satisfying sonic and imagistic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with rich imagery and mostly clean, propulsive syntax; sentences often carry multiple functions (world, mood, character). Some metaphors verge on purple or redundant (e.g., multiple “burden” and “watcher” abstractions, “soundless echo” plus clinking buckle) and could be pared without loss. The “His motivation was simple” sentence is expository scaffolding that slightly flattens the otherwise embodied texture. Nonetheless, clarity never really suffers, and the climactic action reads crisply.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm and length, description is economical yet potent, and most lines do multiple jobs (advancing action, revealing psyche, and sustaining atmosphere). There is little scaffolding or redundancy, and figurative language is generally coherent and grounded. A few phrases skim familiar terrain (“storm inside him,” some aphoristic lines from Veyra), but they do not significantly blunt momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and generally high in information density, with atmosphere and plot advanced in tandem. There’s mild reliance on stock emotional phrasing and a few repeated constructions, but not enough to bog momentum or obscure sense. Figurative language (“storm-born silence,” “innovation in its rawest form”) is restrained and mostly apt; nothing crucial is buried or muddled. Line-level craft is solidly publishable, if not yet singular.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with images usually doing more than one job (e.g., the pull cord as both tool and metaphorical “lifeline”). Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to blur sense, and patterns like “The first time… The second time… Now…” read as intentional rhythmic devices rather than loops. There’s very little scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or the central action. A few abstractions (“the unspoken had been tended to”) skim the edge of telling, but they arrive after the scene has earned them in image.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is strong: images are sharp, metaphors mostly clean, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. Sentences tend to do multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and theme) without becoming purple or overburdened. A couple of abstractions and labeled insights could be made more concrete, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and well-rhythmed, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and interiority. A few phrases lean on familiar shorthand (“the penny dropped,” “clinging to the edge of a cliff”) and some abstract noun strings appear, but they don’t seriously blur sense or momentum. Figurative language remains coherent and measured; there’s no major looping or purple excess around the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong images and generally efficient sentences that often carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and action at once). There is some repetition of favored textures (“serenely electric,” “shard”), but it reads as motif rather than scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled; metaphors like “a shard of hush” and “the universe remembering itself” are striking without collapsing into muddle. A slightly high density of elevated descriptors at times borders on purple, but it doesn’t materially obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line by line, the writing is clean, rhythmic, and mostly economical, with images doing double-duty for mood and world-building. Figurative language is frequent but not stacked to the point of muddle, and sentence variety keeps the piece from sounding mechanical. There are a few familiar turns of phrase (“knife through silk,” “light that slipped through the cracks”) and minor abstraction, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or clarity. With a light pass to prune clichés and sharpen a couple of metaphors, the prose would be publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, vivid, and economical, with strong images like the “sinew thread” and the mother’s face shifting “between youth and age in the span of a heartbeat.” Sentences have good rhythmic variety, and there is little in the way of scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic templates. Some phrases verge on the conceptual or slightly purple (“realistically imaginary,” “rational enchantment”) and do less work than the sharper concrete details. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained throughout, and figurative language rarely muddies instead of sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid phrasing and a good balance between sentence variety and clarity; images like “corpse of coral and steel” and “spires clawed at the dark” are striking. Most lines do double duty—worldbuilding and mood, or character and theme—without obvious padding or loops. There is a mild tilt toward purple in spots and some conceptual repetition around “horizons” and “paths” but not enough to significantly drag momentum. Grammar and mechanics are clean, and the final sentence lands with a clear, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are mostly clean and purposeful, and there’s good variation in sentence rhythm to support mood. Phrases like “the atrium’s glass ceiling dripped with twilight” and “a heartbeat buried under layers of dust” are vivid without tipping into muddle. There is some repetition of mist/voices imagery, but it reads as motif rather than redundancy. The prose balances atmosphere and clarity well, with no significant scaffolding or syntactic artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, specific, and generally do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character). Metaphors (“hummed like a dying whale,” “gold absorbed into the floor like blood into sand”) are vivid and mostly controlled, without piling into purple overload. There are no significant loops or scaffolding; progression is clear and propulsive. A few images are familiar in horror/SF (eggshells, black eyes flecked with gold), but they don’t materially dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and strong, concrete images that usually do double duty for mood and character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically aligned; metaphors like life as a drive in need of defragmentation fit both the digital ghost and Elias’s fractured self. There is little scaffolding or redundancy, and the final line elegantly recharges the opening cosmic imagery. A few phrases edge toward the familiar (e.g., “shatter in an instant”), but they don’t materially dull momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language (leviathan ribs, flock of birds, texture as voice) is coherent and thematically aligned, with no mixed metaphors or purple excess that obscure sense. There is some repetition around “texture” and “patterns,” but it feels intentional rather than scaffolding. The final paragraphs in particular are cleanly cut and land the image without explanatory bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight and high-density, with most sentences doing multiple jobs of mood, worldbuilding, and character. Figurative language is vivid but not overstacked; images like “voices layered with static” and “frostbitten hope” are striking without muddling sense. There are very few redundancies or scaffolding lines, and rhythm varies effectively between longer descriptive sentences and curt pivots at moments of pressure. The one-word ending “He metamorphosed” risks feeling slightly under-rendered but works as a clean, hard stop in this compressed form.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with strong verbs and economical description—many sentences do double duty in advancing atmosphere and plot. Figurative language is present but not overwhelmingly stacked, and the action beats (statue movement, sprint, leap, landing) are sequenced clearly. There are some abstract formulations and mild repetition (“resonantly soft,” “gap between knowing and understanding”) that carry a whiff of discursiveness rather than concrete embodiment. Still, there are no major loops or artifacts, and momentum is well maintained through the climax and into the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, imagery is vivid yet mostly controlled, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors like ink “bleeding into the paper like a bruise” or drones as “mechanical shadows” are apt and not overstacked. A few phrases lean toward familiar lyricism (“illusion of permanence,” “slipped through his fingers”), but they don’t significantly dull momentum or clarity. Overall, information density is high and prose propels rather than stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is strong: metaphorical language (“wild grass that swayed like a crowd long gone,” “a ringmaster with a whip of smoke”) is vivid and generally coherent, and sentences carry multiple functions (mood, motion, character) without much scaffolding. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or mechanical cadences, and momentum remains intact despite the lyricism. A slight tendency toward stacked poetic effects edges close to purple in places, but it doesn’t obscure sense or closure. Line-level craft is clearly publication-ready, if not yet singular.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and generally efficient sentences that each add atmosphere or move the scene. Imagery is often striking (“shelves like the last whisper of a forgotten dream,” “angles bent like reeds in the wind”) and mostly coherent. While it edges toward purple in a few spots and leans heavily on similes, it avoids mixed metaphors or redundancy that would materially slow momentum or blur sense. Line-level control is publication-ready with only minor tightening needed for maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and concise, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information (“where the sea breathed in rhythms older than memory”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; light and sea metaphors are consistent rather than muddled. There are a few slightly stock lines (“air thick with the scent of salt and possibility,” “slipped through his fingers like mist”), but they don’t significantly drag momentum or clarity. Information flow is smooth, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are clean, varied in rhythm, and generally high in information density; most pull double duty in advancing mood and concept. Figurative language is controlled, with a few repeated abstractions (“secrets,” “possibility”) but little true redundancy or looped scaffolding. There’s minimal overwriting, and syntax remains transparent even when lyrical. A touch more concrete embodiment of emotion could further sharpen key beats, but line-level craft is already above typical submission quality.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is tight: vivid verbs, concrete nouns, and layered images pull triple duty for mood, setting, and character. The prose mostly avoids redundancy and purple excess, even when deploying lush description (“its glass panes long shattered by time and tide”). Rhythm varies naturally between long, flowing sentences and sharper beats at moments of revelation or shock. There are few, if any, scaffolding phrases or figurative muddles, though the style leans slightly toward familiar genre-lyricism rather than formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, the metaphors are striking yet mostly coherent, and nearly every line does double duty for mood and characterization. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and information is delivered with high density and clarity. The lyricism occasionally brushes up against ornamentation but never tips into purple; the prose maintains forward momentum. Opening and closing lines are both charged images that frame the piece effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences generally do double duty for image and emotion, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“voice a silver thread,” “no larger than a tear,” “cathedral of gold and crimson”) is dense but mostly coherent and grounded, rarely sliding into mixed metaphor or muddle. Momentum is appropriate for a lyric piece; the scene never stalls in explanatory loops. The main constraint is that the sustained high lyric register flirts with overrichness in places, which slightly blunts impact rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, description is specific, and most metaphors are clean and purposeful. Information density is high—details about the net, needle, and sanctuary usually serve atmosphere, worldbuilding, and stakes simultaneously. There is some tendency toward rich figurative language in nearly every paragraph, but it rarely feels like unmoored purple prose, and clarity is maintained even at the climax. Minor tightening could increase impact, yet the prose is already at a publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language (“as if the land itself had refused to be charted,” “as if the camera had tried to look away”) is apt and disciplined, reinforcing theme rather than showboating. Transitions between reflection and action are smooth and momentum rarely stalls. A few sentences are mildly lush, but they don’t obscure sense or dampen the closure image, keeping the prose in the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, usually doing multiple jobs (setting, character, theme) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but not stacked to opacity; images are clear and rarely redundant, and there’s minimal scaffold or synonym-churn. The line-level work supports momentum from entry to exit, with no major loops or clotted metaphors dulling the climax. The prose readily passes a read-aloud test and feels publishably polished.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythm varies, and most images pull multiple duties (worldbuilding, mood, and theme). Figurative language is present but not stacked to the point of purple prose, and the central metaphors (graffiti as code, bolt plate as key) are clean. There are a few mildly generic or redundant beats, but no serious loops or scaffolding that drag momentum. The closure image is sharp and uncluttered, allowing the emotional aftertaste to linger.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with varied sentence rhythms, purposeful detail, and minimal redundancy. Metaphors (e.g., the diary “slipped beneath her door like a whisper”) are apt and not over-stacked, and there’s no significant purple prose or scaffolding. The prose could be tightened in a few places where abstractions (“joy buried beneath layers of anguish”) appear instead of fresher, more embodied phrasing. Overall, it reads smoothly and professionally without major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting and psyche (“The quiet was explosive here, a pressure building behind the silence”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and coherent; only a couple of abstractions (“spooled wholeness”) flirt with opacity without derailing sense. There are no noticeable scaffold loops or template cadences, and punctuation/grammar are clean. The prose sustains momentum despite its lyricism, rarely feeling purple or stalled.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: the prose is clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for mood and character. There are occasional familiar formulations and similes (“like the petals of a flower,” “damp paper and time,” “dispersed like leaves in a storm”) that lean slightly toward the well-trodden and risk mild purple tint. Still, there’s no real looping, no figurative muddle, and no scaffolding that clutters the closure image. Momentum holds smoothly through a quiet scene.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally elegant and precise: images like “twisting like ink in water” and “a sea of clouds” are vivid without tipping into purple. Sentences are well-shaped, with good variation in length and no obvious scaffolding, loops, or clumsy intensifiers. Information density is high—most lines serve atmosphere and character simultaneously—and syntax remains clear. The prose is polished and fluent, though it lacks the startling linguistic risks that would push it into the topmost literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and mostly free of redundancy, with varied sentence lengths and a pleasing rhythm; images are usually coherent and not over-stacked. Lines often do double duty for mood and worldbuilding, as with the opening sentence and the hall of mirrors description. There is some mild tendency toward abstract or repeated formulations (“rhythm, a pattern, something to guide”) without added pressure, but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or drag momentum. Line-level craft is strong but not yet strikingly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, fluent, and largely free of scaffolding or loops; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, world, or emotional stakes. Figurative language is vivid but mostly disciplined, with only occasional leaning into familiar sentimental constructions (“not out of duty, but out of love”) that mildly dull sharpness. Syntax varies enough to keep rhythm alive, and paragraphing supports the dawning-pattern structure without clutter. There are no significant clarity issues or mixed metaphors to drag momentum or obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is tight: virtually every sentence carries multiple jobs (world, mood, and character) and the figurative language is controlled, with no mixed metaphors or muddled images. Parallel structures (“Not to save the world, but to soothe it”; “Not silent—quiet”) are used sparingly and to good effect, and there is minimal scaffolding or redundancy. The density of imagery skirts purple but remains grounded and clear, maintaining momentum through to the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is clean, concise, and purposeful; most sentences do at least two jobs, advancing plot and tone together. Figurative language is vivid but not overstacked, and there are no noticeable scaffolding loops or cadence artifacts. Syntax and paragraphing support momentum, particularly as the scream and pursuit arrive. A few metaphors (“beggar’s grip,” “rough as bark”) flirt with familiar territory but are well-executed enough not to drag.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, well-rhythmed, and largely free of scaffolding or repetition; most sentences do at least two jobs (image + emotion, or setting + theme). Metaphoric language is mostly precise and coherent, with the recurring river/foam/chrysalis motifs building an integrated texture. There are occasional on-the-nose constructions and thematic statements that slightly blunt the subtlety of otherwise strong lines. Line-level craft is strong enough for serious venues, though it could be tightened further by trusting images a bit more and explanation a bit less.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clean mechanics, and high information density with most lines doing multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and theme). Figurative language is frequent but largely fresh and coherent (coin as sigh, coat unraveling into seeds, moonlight pooling into a key), with little in the way of mixed metaphors or clutter. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum remains steady even in reflective moments. The only constraint on a higher score is that density of imagery occasionally edges toward decorative rather than strictly pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs, and figurative language is vivid yet controlled (“the way the tide had pulled her under like a hungry mouth”). There are few to no paraphrase loops, and the rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum. A couple of metaphors repeat structural patterns (“the way…”), but they don’t significantly dull impact. Overall, the prose is clean, clear, and musical without sliding into purple.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and well-proofed, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme. Some formulations are familiar or slightly platitudinous (“not just in song, but in understanding,” “this—this was the fire”), but they don’t derail clarity. There’s mild repetition of structural patterns (“She [verb]...”) and some turns of phrase that summarize what’s just been shown, yet momentum remains intact. Figurative language is controlled and not so dense as to muddy sense.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: many sentences do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and character, and there are few if any true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is mostly coherent and thematically aligned (constellations, hum, fractures), with only occasional risk of purple (“weight of forgotten things,” “quaking reverie”). Momentum is appropriate for an introspective piece; reflection is anchored in concrete stimuli and doesn’t stall comprehension. A slightly heavy density of metaphors in some paragraphs prevents the prose from fully breathing at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, images are striking, and there’s high information density without serious confusion. Some phrasing leans redundant or overly adorned (“clandestinely luminous glow,” repeated “latent blaze”), and the figurative texture is near-saturation in places, but clarity and momentum survive. Trimming a few modifiers and tightening repetition would bring this to a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm is varied and mostly tight, with strong verbs and purposeful figurative language that suits the meditative mood. Most lines do more than one job—advancing action, revealing interiority, and maintaining atmosphere—without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. A few sentences lean into on-the-nose abstraction (“This was empathy in motion, he realized”; “Music in a silent world wasn’t about perfection”) which slightly blunts the otherwise precise imagery. Overall, the line-level craft is polished and publication-ready with only minor opportunities for tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is clean and largely free of redundancy or syntactic monotony, with some strong images (“the last light of dusk bled into the magnetic nexus”). Figurative language appears regularly but not in suffocating density, and it generally enhances clarity rather than muddling it. Information density is good: backstory and present action are balanced without bloated exposition. The minor weakness is a slight tendency toward familiar lyric moves without the extra precision that would elevate this to truly exceptional prose.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished: varied sentence structure, strong verbs, and images that usually pull double duty for setting and theme. Occasional high-register or aphoristic lines are noticeable but don’t snowball into purple prose or thematic lecturing. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or rhythm artifacts that drag momentum. Overall, the writing is clean, efficient, and musically attentive.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally tight, grammatically clean, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double-duty for mood and characterization. Sensory images, especially olfactory and tactile ones, are well chosen and not overstacked. A few phrases veer toward purple or self-conscious (“turning of the tide’s thought,” “wildflower hush”), and the closing thematic statements tread close to exposition rather than image-driven resonance, but they don’t seriously muddy clarity. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and momentum holds well for a quiet piece.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, sensory, and efficient, with most doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus interiority). Figurative language (“plucked string of a harp no one had touched,” “drifted upward like stars”) is vivid and not overstacked, avoiding purple excess. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum is maintained through clean paragraphing and logical transitions. A few phrases lean familiar (“her breath caught”), but they don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally lean, vivid, and purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty (atmosphere plus character or plot). Figurative language (“as if the city itself was breathing,” “turning the port into a machine of its own design”) strengthens rather than muddies sense. There is a bit of familiar phrasing and some parallel sentence openings, but no significant loops, padding, or purple excess that drag momentum. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive markets, if not yet strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong sensory density and generally efficient sentences that advance both atmosphere and tension. Figurative language (“indigo bloomed,” “colors of the aurora cradle her like a lullaby”) is vivid and coherent, with few, if any, mixed metaphors or redundancies. The rhythm varies well between long, flowing descriptive lines and tighter, action-focused beats around the chisel strikes. It is rich enough to flirt with purple, but remains controlled and clear, especially at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally tight, with vivid yet economical images (e.g., the flute as “a sliver of captured sun”) and minimal redundancy. The prose balances lyricism with clarity; metaphors are consistent with the story’s sonic and tactile motifs and do not muddle sense. There is little scaffold language or synonym churn, and sentences mostly carry more than one layer of work (setting mood while advancing plot or theme). A few phrases verge on ornate, but they don’t accumulate enough to slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is high: varied rhythms, dense but largely coherent metaphors, and very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative choices (“gaps like missing teeth,” “equations…like a predator’s grin”) are vivid and thematically apt, rarely straying into muddle. The lyric density occasionally borders on purple but does not significantly impede clarity or motion. Information is tightly packed, with nearly every line doing atmospheric, thematic, or character work.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, generally concise, and often do double-duty with image and emotion. Figurative language (“ridgeway stretched like a scar across the sky”) is vivid without devolving into muddled metaphor chains. There is little evident redundancy or scaffolding, and rhythm supports the gradual build to the threshold moment. A few phrases (“pressed harder than its brass casing,” “its magic spent”) lean on familiar turns, but they don’t materially dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is clean and often elegant, with vivid images like “crystalline branches fracturing the pale light into spectral shards” and “a language—one of silence and shifted hush.” Sentences generally carry more than one function (image, theme, and character) without feeling overstuffed, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There are minor redundancies around belief vs proof and the thematic statements, but no significant loops or purple muddle that harm closure. The final paragraphs maintain clarity and cadence, giving the last image quiet force.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, mostly concise, and carry layered information—worldbuilding, mood, and character—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors like “the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry” push toward the purple but land coherently within the established lyrical mode. There are no major loops, template cadences, or filter-verb clusters that drag momentum or obscure causality. A bit more variation in figurative strategy (balancing the textile/tapestry imagery with other domains) could add freshness without sacrificing cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is clean, with few redundancies and a generally good balance of description, action, and interior summary; sentences often do double duty (worldbuilding + mood, or setting + character). Figurative language is mostly apt and not overstacked, and there are minimal artifacts or loops; the prose reads smoothly aloud. Some phrases lean generic or sentimental (“his heart full,” “quiet promise”), which slightly flattens otherwise strong images like “vein of azure defiance.” Overall, though, momentum and clarity are maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally tight, with good rhythm and vivid but not overstuffed imagery; lines often do double duty for atmosphere and character. Occasional phrases are somewhat stock (“the weight of the question pressing against his ribs,” “Kael made his decision”) but they don’t significantly drag momentum. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles, and syntax varies enough to keep the ear engaged. Overall, line-level craft is solid and publication-ready with only minor polishing needed for freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and economical, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character; images like “bruised twilight” and “carried it like a talisman against the dark” are vivid and apt. There is some repetition in the aphoristic note lines, but it reads as intentional patterning rather than scaffolding. Syntax and paragraphing are clear, with no confusion in sequence or pronoun reference. Occasional near-purple touches are restrained enough not to blur meaning or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (image, worldbuilding, and tone) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and thematically unified (light, storms, printing, weaving). Rhythm shifts appropriately between expansive description and tighter, charged beats around the vision and the closing pulses of the lighthouse. It stops short of the very top tier because there’s little pruning of lyrical density in moments that might benefit from sharper, more cutting simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: imagery is fresh (legs of a heron, quiet explosiveness, stories clinging like pollen), and most sentences perform multiple functions (setting, character, theme) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and patterned around light, mist, color, and suspension, avoiding mixed metaphors. There are no noticeable loops or scaffold sentences; momentum is gently sustained despite the reflective mode. A slight density of lyricism in mid-paragraphs keeps it just shy of absolute top-tier sharpness, but it never obscures clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: images are mostly clean, information density is high, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors like moonlight “pooling…like mercury” and roots “unfurling” in his skin are vivid without becoming a muddled pile. The prose sustains momentum despite being reflective, with nearly every sentence adding either texture or insight. A slight tendency toward stacked abstractions in a couple of spots is the only thing keeping it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is solid: sentences are well-formed, varied in length, and usually do multiple jobs (setting tone while advancing action). The figurative language—threads, seeds, weaving, captured starlight—forms a cohesive cluster rather than a muddle, and repetition feels more deliberate motif than artifact. There are a few familiar phrases (“throat was raw,” “heart ached”) and some mildly redundant beats, but they don’t significantly drag momentum. Information is delivered efficiently with no major scaffolding or template cadence issues.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: sensory detail is economical, metaphors are generally apt, and most lines carry more than one function (character, mood, and theme interwoven). There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the prose moves forward with good momentum for a reflective piece. Phrases like “enlarged tranquility” flirt with abstraction but are anchored by clear physical actions (map clutched, stepping into the night). No significant artifacts or overwriting mar the closure beat, which lands cleanly in image and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with purposeful description; most sentences do more than one job. Metaphors are mostly coherent and effective (“the slow, creeping way of things that slip from memory before they’re truly absent”), with minimal redundancy or scaffold. A few choices verge on abstract or slightly clunky (“heuristically gentle,” “uncloaked the truth”) which momentarily lift the reader out of the scene. These are minor slips rather than pervasive issues, so momentum and clarity stay intact.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and there are few if any true scaffolding or synonym loops. Repeated motifs (“quartz hush,” illusions fading, breath curling) function more as intentional patterning than waste. Metaphors are controlled and largely coherent, though the density of figurative language is quite high in places, flirting with purple without tipping into muddle. Momentum holds steady through the scene, and the final sentence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, tightly chosen verbs, and images that typically carry both atmosphere and thematic weight. Most sentences do more than one job, advancing mood, character, or stakes without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is used judiciously and seldom feels purple; the opening line’s “pier groaned under the weight of the night” neatly teaches the story’s metaphoric register. A few metaphors (e.g., “spilled rum and broken promises”) are somewhat familiar but do not significantly blunt momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant and efficient, with several striking images and a good mix of sentence rhythms. Most lines do double duty—worldbuilding and mood (forest elections), character and tone (her skepticism) are intertwined without bloat. A few phrases lean on familiar shorthand (“his voice like distant thunder,” “curiosity gnawed at her”), but they don’t seriously sap momentum or clarity. There are no evident loops, syntactic templates, or figurative muddles, and the final image is clean and resonant on the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, metaphor generally coherent, and most lines carry both atmosphere and narrative information. The opening images (“laughter…slithered through the cracks of his charcoal-stained fingers like smoke”) are especially effective and set a high bar that the rest mostly meets. There is mild lushness in places, but it doesn’t significantly slow momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character—very little feels like filler or scaffolding. Imagery is vivid but not overwrought, and metaphor choices are coherent with the world’s tone (bruise-colored sky, dried-blood dusk, skeletal plants). Sentence rhythms vary enough to keep momentum, and action sequencing is clear. A minor risk is an overall lushness that, in a longer piece, might need more variation, but here it supports rather than drags.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and economical for its lyric density; most sentences perform multiple functions (world-building, mood, character) without padding. Figurative language is generally clean and coherent (“The world is a bell. You don’t make it ring. You tune it until it remembers its own song”) and avoids mixed metaphors. There are no noticeable loops, template cadences, or filter-verb stacks that drag momentum or obscure causality. A very slight tendency toward similar sentence rhythms in reflective passages keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, economical, and often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding + emotion + theme). Imagery like “static crackling like distant thunder” and fears as physical specimens is evocative without becoming incoherent. There is some mild purple-prose drift (“lips of a sleeping god,” “ghost of a childhood he never had”), but it stays legible and doesn’t stall momentum. I see no significant loops or scaffold; nearly every sentence earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and economical, with several strong images (dawn “spilled over the courtyard like honey,” the lock “jiggled” rather than broken). Sentences do multiple jobs—advancing plot while sketching character and mood—without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Some expressions are stock (“held its breath,” “shoulders shaking”) and the “sandstorm calm” metaphor arrives a bit abruptly, feeling more decorative than organically prepared. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained, and figurative language is present but not overbearing.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do more than one job (worldbuilding + mood + character) and avoid redundancy, and metaphors (“the way a spider spins its web as both trap and home”) are striking yet coherent. Prose occasionally pushes toward purple but remains legible and purposeful, with few if any true scaffold or paraphrase loops. Rhythm modulates well, tightening around dice rolls and the hatch opening. A slight trimming of repeated conceptual notes (secrets, borrowed time) could sharpen momentum even more.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, with high information density and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language (e.g., “like the inside of a conch shell pressed to the ear”) is evocative yet controlled, avoiding mixed or overgrown metaphors. There are no noticeable loops, template cadences, or filter-verb stacks that sap momentum, and crucial beats are dramatized rather than summarized. Rhythm supports mood shifts from routine to uncanny without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with evocative metaphors and efficient scene progression; there are few, if any, outright unclear sentences. However, figurative language is dense and occasionally repetitive—“smoothed hush,” “tranquil blaze,” “terrestrially cosmic”—creating mild purple-prose drag and some redundancy of effect. Several adjacent lines restate similar ideas about silence and release, which could be tightened for sharper momentum. The closure image remains clear and resonant, so stylistic excess does not materially harm it.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images like “dust of the stars” and “language of stone and mortar” are vivid without tipping into purple, and most lines do multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) efficiently. Rhythm is varied, with clean syntax and no noticeable loops or scaffolding, and paragraphing supports momentum. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there are no clarity issues around cause/effect or staging. For top-tier literary venues, a touch more lexical idiosyncrasy or compression at peak beats could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied in rhythm, and carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without padding. Images are precise and rarely overwrought, and there is little to no paraphrase looping or template cadence. Figurative language is concentrated but not stacked to the point of purple prose, and the final paragraphs retain clarity while sustaining lyricism. A few phrases approach conceptual shorthand, yet they don’t significantly blunt momentum or obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, vivid, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding, with most lines doing double duty for mood and information. The figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors usually cohere and avoid mixed imagery, and there is no obvious looping or synonym churn. A few aphoristic constructions toward the end (“The key had no lock because the door was never meant to be opened—only passed through.”) flirt with overstatement, but they remain clear and do not obscure causality or closure. Overall, the prose feels publish-ready with only light tightening needed around the most slogan-like lines.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, images are clean, and most metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned. The prose carries high information density without obvious loops or padding, and the rhythm fits the meditative mood. Occasional choices (“progressive disclosure,” “the universe hummed its secret song”) edge toward conceptual cliché or register mismatch, but they don’t significantly obscure or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lean yet evocative, with strong image economy and minimal redundancy; nearly every sentence carries character, world, or thematic work. Metaphors are coherent and integrated (melted snow globe as window, wreck in the bloodline, “truth burns too bright”) without slipping into purple excess. Rhythm varies well between longer, lyrical sentences and short, declarative beats at turns like “Mara didn’t believe in accidents.” There are no notable scaffolding loops, syntactic monotony, or line-level confusions that drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically pleasing, and information-dense, with imagery that generally remains coherent and purposeful. Metaphors like the village “clung to the mountainside like a mossy secret” and fireflies “like embers in the dark” enrich atmosphere without piling into incoherence. There’s little evident scaffolding, redundancy, or filter-verb clutter, and the prose maintains clarity through its lyricism. A few phrases (e.g., “scintillatingly somber”) flirt with ornament for its own sake but don’t materially slow momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is clean and readable, with a good balance of concrete detail and forward motion; very little feels like scaffolding or fluff. Occasional familiar phrases (“Elias’s pulse quickened,” “no matter the cost”) and lightly redundant emphasis on truth and lies slightly dull freshness but do not obstruct clarity. Sentence rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum, and the prose generally does more than one job at a time (atmosphere plus characterization or plot). There are no conspicuous figurative tangles, tense slips, or structural artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory images and few redundancies; most sentences pull their weight by combining atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and disciplined—no mixed metaphors or scaffolding loops undercut the climax. Syntax varies enough to keep momentum, and action ordering is clear in both observatory and valley sequences. The final lines land crisply without explanatory overrun.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images like “like a lullaby sung by a ghost” and “the sky was still a bruise of purple and gold” are vivid without overwhelming clarity. The prose is lean—most sentences carry more than one function (setting, mood, interiority) and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to feel purple, and the rhythm supports the quiet, accumulative mode. The main constraint on an even higher score is a handful of slightly stock formulations that don’t quite match the originality of the best lines.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is strong: metaphors are generally apt and not overstacked, and sentences carry multiple jobs (advancing plot and atmosphere together). Pacing is well-managed, with little scaffolding or repetition and a clear rhythm through setup, confrontation, and resolution. Some phrases (“breath no longer a ghost in the cold”) veer toward familiar, but they don’t significantly dull the closure image. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the prose remains clear even when working with abstract concepts like “vibrational matching.”

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often striking (“its black spires clawing at the twilight sky,” “a skin, thin and deceptive, hiding depths that could swallow a man whole”). Some conceptual repetition and slightly overexplicit thematic lines create mild redundancy but do not significantly impede momentum. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly coherent and not so dense as to feel purple. Line-level craft is solidly publishable, though a revision could tighten paraphrase loops and rely more on image than abstract statement.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence-level craft is clean and readable, with mostly solid rhythm and no glaring grammatical issues. There’s a modest but noticeable reliance on familiar thriller/thriller-adjacent phrasing and metaphors, and some paraphrase-like reinforcement (“This wasn’t just about control—it was about destruction”) that doesn’t add new information. Information density is decent but not maximized; a bit of line tightening could sharpen momentum and atmosphere simultaneously. The final image is serviceable but could be more surprising or formally compressed for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, compact paragraphs, and lines that often do double duty (atmosphere plus character insight). Figurative language (“light filtering… like broken promises,” “metronome for guilt”) is mostly precise and not over-stacked, though a few similes are familiar (“rain slicing… like a blade”). There are no noticeable loops, filler scaffolding, or clarity issues, and information density is high for the length. The final image with storm and truth lands cleanly without syntactic clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) and maintain forward motion, with effective figurative language (“lie tasted like copper,” “symbols bled into sense”). The prose edges toward purple only in a couple of spots and occasionally imports slightly clunky constructs tied to the required elements, creating minor tonal bumps. There’s little true scaffolding or looped phrasing, and the closure image is clean and vivid. Tightening or naturalizing a handful of mandated phrases would raise density and polish.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with a good sense of rhythm between summary and scene. There are a few slightly formulaic beats and repeated intensifiers (“The deeper she dug,” “It all made sense now”), but they don’t significantly blunt momentum. Figurative language is mostly restrained and apt—the “digital graveyard” and the song that “was trying to remember something lost” are effective without overstrain. Overall, the lines are competent and serviceable, if not especially surprising or compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level work is generally strong: vivid metaphors (“time seemed to thicken like molasses,” “ice floes…like teeth”), clear syntax, and efficient paragraphing that keeps momentum. There is some mild purple over-density in stacked similes and a few repeated constructions, but they don’t materially blur sense. Sentences often pull double duty for atmosphere and plot, and the climactic beat (“Then the ice screamed”) is clean and punchy. Trimming a few abstract formulations and slightly mixed metaphors would bring the prose closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and economical, with most sentences doing double duty for character and atmosphere (“His chest rising and falling in shallow, uneven waves…like pebbles dragged across a frozen shore”). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and not overstacked; it rarely muddies clarity. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the final image (“windborne solace”) neatly ties prior motifs without strain. A few lines verge on the familiar (“the most beautiful thing Elias had ever heard”), but they don’t significantly dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: images like the golden canvas rippling, mist swallowing taillights, and ashes on her fingertips are precise and evocative. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, maintaining momentum without clutter or obvious scaffolding. A few abstract or academic phrases (“intersubjective understanding,” “Destined mismatches”) slightly jar against the otherwise sensory prose and edge toward thematic labeling. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not so dense as to obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and efficient: most sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, character) without obvious padding. Imagery is strong but not so dense as to become purple; metaphors like “a second heartbeat” or “a voice that wasn’t a voice” are clear and integrated. There are no meaningful loops, syntactic glitches, or figurative muddles that obscure action or closure. A few abstractions (“unspoken knowledge,” “echo of wisdom”) lean general, but they are anchored enough in concrete context to keep momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and rhythmically comfortable, with some well-turned images (“its walls overtaken by vines that curled like fingers around the rusted metal”). Information density is decent, though there are paraphrase-like repetitions around pain, healing, and the factory’s past that could be tightened without loss. A few clichés or near-clichés (“skeleton of its former self,” “exactly where he was meant to be”) and overt similes blunt the otherwise careful atmosphere. There are no major artifacts or confusions, but the lines rarely surprise or compress in a way that feels publication-ready at a top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is polished: varied sentence structures, clean syntax, and efficient paragraphing that supports the accumulating mood. Phrases like “deciphering not words but the spaces between them” and “the gardens weren’t mutating; they were remembering” are tight and resonant without feeling overwrought. There’s occasional conceptual repetition around silence, sound, and growth, but it generally layers rather than looping. Figurative language is frequent yet controlled, and nothing obscures the closure image or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in rhythm, most images do double duty (atmosphere plus theme), and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Metaphors are generally coherent and well-chosen (e.g., “the hush of old videotapes left unwatched hung in the air”), with density that enriches rather than clogs. Transitions between beats are smooth, and the final cadence (“Somewhere, the sound of growing older waited. And this time, he wouldn’t forget.”) lands cleanly. One could trim a modest number of metaphoric flourishes without loss, but they do not obscure sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally tight, evocative, and rhythmically varied; most sentences carry multiple loads (image, mood, and plot) without feeling redundant. Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (time, light, escape) and do not contradict one another, even if they cluster densely at moments. There are a few near-repetitions (“changelessly constant,” “luminous ache”) and a slight purple tendency that could be pruned for maximum impact, but momentum and clarity remain intact. The closing cadence is strong and clean, with no significant line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful, with most lines doing double duty for mood and character. Imagery is rich but controlled; metaphors (the room as haven, the record as broken but still musical) are coherent and extended rather than stacked. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; the prose keeps momentum despite the stillness of the scene. A few phrases verge on the polished-lyric familiar, but none blunt the closure or obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is clean, with good sentence variety and generally efficient description that does more than one job. Images like “reflections spilling out like ink into water” and the physicality of the key and dais are concrete without over-ornamentation. There are a few abstract or expositional phrases (“time after spoons bent reality,” “half-forgotten whispers”) that do less work, but they don’t significantly drag momentum. No major loops, muddled metaphors, or clarity issues appear, including at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, dense with meaning, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is fresh and coherent (“like a star trapped in enamel,” “the garden…a cleft in certainty”) and rarely overdone, sustaining atmosphere without purple blur. Information is efficiently packed so that nearly every line advances character, setting, or theme. A handful of abstract formulations could be sharpened into more concrete embodiment, but they don’t materially dull momentum or the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: vivid images, efficient sentences that mostly do double-duty (character + theme, or setting + mood), and very little scaffold or repetition. Figurative language is rich but not cluttered, with extended images (drowned memories, captured moonlight) that are consistent and legible. Syntax is varied and clear; no loops or template cadences blunt momentum, and the final image lands cleanly. A slight tendency toward explanatory phrasing in key thematic sentences is the only notable softness.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is polished: strong verbs, precise images (“server racks draped in ivy like the ribs of some slumbering beast”), and generally efficient sentences that carry both atmosphere and character. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and pattern-consistent (amber, honey, frost, moss), avoiding mixed metaphors or real muddle. A few phrases verge on purple or redundant (“honeyed hush,” the reiterated icicle patterns) without adding new pressure, which slightly blunts momentum. Still, clarity and rhythm hold throughout, easily clearing professional standards.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sensory details do double duty for mood and theme, and most sentences advance more than one layer (character, setting, or concept). Figurative language is generally apt (“edges blurring like ink in water”), with only occasional risk of mild overrichness, not enough to cloud clarity. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the prose maintains momentum despite its contemplative tone. A slightly tighter discipline on repeated thematic phrasing could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and generally efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but rarely feels purple or muddled; metaphors like “its leaves still furled tight as a newborn’s fist” are concrete and legible. Momentum is appropriate to a lyric, low-action scene, and the closing image (“scent of mint and memory”) neatly echoes prior details without redundancy. I see no significant grammatical or clarity issues and no artifacts that blur the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and tightly edited: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads—worldbuilding, mood, and character—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically unified around breath, light, and stillness, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. Rhythm on the line level supports the meditative tone without becoming monotonous, and key beats (the folding, the ignition, the hovering jar) are rendered with clarity. A few phrases (“his motivation had always been the same”) verge on explanatory, but they don’t materially drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, densely informative, and generally do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character all at once). Figurative language (e.g., “the lull of a wounded one,” “light...like liquid gold”) is mostly precise and thematically tuned, without mixed metaphors. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and punctuation/grammar are clean. A few lines verge on abstraction or explicit statement, but they don’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: most lines do double duty in establishing atmosphere and advancing the ritual, with few true redundancies. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent (bone splinter, river stone, thorns) and thematically aligned with burden, regret, and permanence. There are minor instances of density that verge on ornamental (“shingled hush,” “boundary-lessly trapped”) without adding much causal pressure, but they don’t materially obscure sense or closure. Overall momentum holds and the final image is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, clean syntax, and high information density with minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined, and images generally align (no mixed metaphors that break coherence). Each paragraph either advances her emotional state or deepens atmosphere; there’s little dead weight. The final sentences land with clarity and cadence, recharging earlier motifs without explanatory padding.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a high density of lines doing double duty (world-building plus emotional shading). Metaphors are generally apt and coherent with the established imagery (erosion, threads, reflections, static), and repetition is purposeful rather than looped. There are a few familiar phrases (“like the moment between heartbeats”), but they do not materially dull the closure. No noticeable scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic monotony interferes with momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and purposeful, with metaphors that mostly land and do not tangle (“neon residue still clinging to the air like a half-remembered promise”). Information density is high without feeling crowded, and there’s little redundancy or scaffold. A few lines edge toward slogan-like abstraction in the closing paragraphs, but they don’t significantly obscure or stall the prose. Overall, rhythm and clarity are well-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and economical, usually doing double duty for mood and information. Figurative language (“glacial hush,” “a scent that clung to him like a second skin”) is selective and coherent rather than overstacked. There’s minimal redundancy and no obvious scaffolding or template cadence that drags momentum, and both opening and ending images are cleanly framed. A bit more syntactic variety at a few points where sentences start with similar structures could add further texture.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is clean and purposeful: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, characterization) with minimal scaffolding, and there are no major clarity lapses. Figurative language is mostly apt and non-redundant, though certain abstractions (“serene upheaval,” “hindsight clarity”) edge toward thematic labeling rather than fresh image. There are no obvious loops, template cadences, or filter-verb clusters that drag momentum. The final lines land crisply and recharge early motifs without being overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level work is polished: varied sentence rhythms, strong verbs, and evocative images like “harbor fog rolling toward him like a living thing” and “each plank groaning like a sleeping giant.” Information density is high and most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, character, theme) without feeling bloated. There is a slight drift toward purple at times and some thematic paraphrasing, but no serious redundancy or figurative muddle that obscures clarity or closure. This is solid, publication-ready prose, if not yet stylistically transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: images are clear, sentences carry multiple jobs (character, theme, atmosphere), and there’s little outright redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors (breath as sigh, thread as history, grief as geography) are coherent and extended with intention rather than stacked haphazardly. There is mild risk of purple prose and conceptual repetition around absence/grief/weaving that slightly blurs momentum, but it never obscures meaning or closure. With a bit more pruning of familiar formulations, this would approach elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level writing is generally tight and musical, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, mood, and character (“wings, their edges still damp with the remnants of the egg’s dream”). Figurative language is rich but mostly controlled; metaphors like “like the last sigh of a dying star” fit the mythic tone without clashing. There’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition, and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum in what is essentially a static physical scene. A few abstract phrasings (“flaw in his genesis”) and stacked modifiers could be pared back, but they do not materially harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally polished: strong images, varied syntax, and efficient embedding of backstory into the present scene. The black sand and coin motifs are woven in without feeling clumsy, and sentences usually carry multiple functions (scene, mood, character). There is some mild scaffold and repetition of thesis phrases (“She had come to prove that scars could sing,” the reiterated “came here” purpose) that could be trimmed to sharpen momentum. Figurative language stays coherent and doesn’t overrun clarity, keeping the lyricism effective rather than purple.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and metaphors that mostly align and reinforce rather than clash. The prose regularly pulls double duty, advancing plot while deepening mood (“twine that smelled of rain and old paper” both grounds and hints at age and secrecy). There’s little scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line carries weight, and momentum is maintained despite the reflective, atmospheric mode. A handful of phrases flirt with over-ornamentation, but they don’t obscure sense or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and a good balance between image and clarity; metaphors around petals, light, and gears are coherent and not over-layered. Repetition of key motifs (petals, sonar, light) generally feels deliberate rather than looped scaffolding. Sentences do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character—without bloating, and there are no major grammatical or syntactic issues. At times the language edges toward the lush, but momentum remains intact, especially through the middle and closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and strong, mostly clean metaphors (mist “like a shroud,” ribbon “pooling in his lap like a living thing”). Sensory detail is purposeful, and sentences often carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, and theme) without feeling bloated. There are minor tendencies toward thematic repetition and abstract phrasing at the end, but no real loops, mixed metaphors, or cadence templates that sap momentum. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only light tightening needed around explicit statements of insight.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is strong: images like “waves hissed like dying embers” and the pendulum “slicing time into perfect, forgiving slices” are vivid and efficient. Most sentences do double duty (atmosphere plus character or theme), and there’s little wasted scaffolding or paraphrase. A few formulations skirt the edge of purple or redundant emphasis (“balance was sacred”; “hour of reckoning”), slightly dulling the sharpness of surrounding lines. Overall rhythm and clarity remain high, with no artifacts that obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary rhythmically, are largely free of scaffolding, and often carry multiple functions (atmosphere plus characterization or plot). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, with few, if any, mixed metaphors or redundancies. The prose sustains momentum in a reflective, accumulative mode without obvious loops or padding. It is slightly lush for some markets, yet remains intelligible and purposeful through the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences are generally clear, fluid, and purposeful, with vivid images such as the spire “like a blade of black glass” and the page “hummed with possibility.” There is some conceptual repetition (innovation vs. constraint, future as possibility) and mild abstraction, but not enough to significantly stall momentum. Figurative language remains coherent and not overwrought; most lines pull double duty for atmosphere and theme. Tighter pruning of slightly redundant phrases and a few high-level summaries would sharpen the impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and often lovely (“the last of the fire’s glow curled like a sleeping cat,” “its dial glow pulsing faintly, a secret heartbeat in the dark”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, building a consistent texture rather than lapsing into muddle. There’s minor redundancy and occasional leaning into well-trodden comparisons (smoke, mirage) but no major scaffolding or syntactic monotony. With light tightening, these sentences would be competitive at high-end venues.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: most sentences do double duty advancing mood and character, and images like “beautiful in the way a knife is beautiful” or “dust motes hung in the air, suspended like the truth he had been chasing” are vivid without feeling gratuitous. There’s good syntactic variety and no significant scaffolding, loops, or clunky exposition. A few formulations (“He understood now”) and direct abstractions of theme are slightly flatter than the surrounding prose but don’t materially harm momentum or clarity. Overall, the piece reads as ready for publication with only very light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, fluent, and largely economical, with vivid images (“ink-stained fingers,” “bones piled in the catacombs”) and minimal scaffolding. Sentences vary in length and function, and most lines carry multiple jobs (character, world, theme) without obvious padding. There is some conceptual repetition (plague, progress, cowardice, forgetting) that could be trimmed for even higher density, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, with no mixed metaphors or major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, evocative, and information-dense without much redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and unobtrusively supports mood (“like ice over a pond,” “like leaves settling after a storm”). There are no major clarity issues, and transitions between description, reflection, and action remain smooth. At times the prose leans toward the decorative, but it doesn’t slip into muddle or slow the piece’s short-form momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence-level craft is clean and rhythmic, with strong verbs and generally efficient description that does more than one job at a time. Imagery around rust, decay, and iridescent growth is vivid without tipping into purple, and there are few if any true scaffolding or synonym loops. The main weaknesses are occasional abstract labels (“informally wise,” “gentle rebellion”) and explanatory lines that tell theme instead of embodying it. These slightly blunt the impact but don’t significantly harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is tight and purposeful, with strong verbs and concrete imagery anchoring even its more metaphorical phrases. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and there is little to no scaffolding or explanatory redundancy; information density is high without obscuring clarity. Metaphor use is frequent but generally coherent and well-chosen, giving the piece a distinct texture without collapsing into muddle. A couple of lines (“truth clawing up his throat,” “felt like a secret begging to be kept”) flirt with familiar idioms, but they don’t materially dull the closure or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are varied, dense with purposeful imagery, and almost every line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and on-theme, avoiding mixed metaphors or decorative excess that would blur sense. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences; phrasing like “the shape of a sound, the ghost of a breath held too long” hits the lyric register without losing clarity. A marginal increase in syntactic spareness at the central experiment might sharpen momentum further, but the prose is already well within elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are vivid, clauses are clean, and most lines perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without visible scaffolding. Figurative language is mostly apt and coherent (“violet liquid swirling like captured twilight,” “threading through the city’s bones like blood through veins”), and there are no major loops or clunky transitional templates. A slight tendency toward abstract phrasing in the final paragraph (“the weight of what it meant to truly understand”) trims edge sharpness but does not seriously impede momentum or clarity. Overall, the prose would require only light line edits for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is clean, grammatical, and rhythmically varied; nearly every sentence carries either character, atmosphere, or concept. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and metaphors are coherent with the story’s concerns (regret as smell, hope as bruise). There’s minimal redundancy or scaffold, and action order remains clear. This is polished, publication-ready prose, even if it doesn’t yet push into truly striking linguistic risk.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: images are mostly sharp (“liquid black as the space between stars,” “sealing the panes with putty mixed from her own spit and stubbornness”), and sentences usually do multiple jobs (character, setting, theme) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to blur meaning, and there are no obvious loops or scaffold sentences. Rhythm largely matches the contemplative mode, with the final lines delivering a clean, charged cadence. A few images (“saved her,” “the world was still kind”) lean abstract compared to the best concrete lines, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clean mechanics, and high information density with most lines doing double duty (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus theme). Figurative language is present but not excessively stacked, and metaphors generally cohere with the world’s sensory palette (water, stone, paper, bread, bees). There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or clarity breaks; the prose moves efficiently from beat to beat. The lushness is just shy of razor-sharp minimalism, but it never significantly slows momentum or muddies the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: minimal redundancy, high information density, and figurative language that’s vivid without tipping into muddle or purple. Images like the yoyo rising instead of falling and the storm clouds “unraveling into clear sky” are both clear and thematically apt. Sentences are well-paced and avoid template cadences or filler scaffolding; nearly every line earns its place. The prose enhances, rather than competes with, the underlying action and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, vivid, and efficient, often doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology (“a repulsive allure that clung to the back of his throat”). Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent, with minimal purple excess and no major mixed metaphors. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and the rhythm tightens appropriately around the mirror confrontation. The prose comes close to publish-ready, needing only light trimming of a few aphoristic lines to reach top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly tight yet lyrical, with images doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character perception together). There’s some repetition of concepts (fractal patterns, resonance, obstacles into instruments), but it reads as intentional motif rather than scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent yet controlled; metaphors stay within the established sensory logic of sea, wood, and sound. The prose maintains momentum despite its density and avoids mixed metaphors or obvious loops.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, clean syntax, and images that carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus mood plus theme) without bogging momentum. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. The ending cadence (“The gate was rusted shut, but the cracks were everywhere. / And she would find them all.”) lands with a crisp, propulsive rhythm. A trace more cutting of mild reiterations of “watching” and “cracks” could make the density even tighter, but current line-level is already above typical submissions.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and often vivid (“arched windows choked with ivy that crept inward like grasping fingers”) with good rhythm and clear sequencing. Most sentences multitask—advancing atmosphere, character, and stakes without obvious scaffolding or loops. A few lines lean into abstraction or near-platitude around truth and history, slightly blunting the sharpness of earlier concrete imagery. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publication-ready with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with strong information density—most lines carry both atmosphere and character insight. There is some repetition at the conceptual level (several variations on holding things together, the town moving on, the river always winning) but it reads as thematic echo rather than scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; images seldom feel mixed or purple, and rhythm supports the contemplative pace. A touch more pruning of abstract nouns (“absence,” “oblivion”) in favor of concrete image could further heighten immediacy, but current line-level craft is already above typical submission quality.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clear, fluid, and often evocative (“water outside the arched windows filtered the dim light into shifting patterns”), with good information density and minimal redundancy. Sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and most images do double duty for setting and mood. A few phrases are clunky or overworked, and there’s a slight tendency toward repeated abstractions around stillness and truth, but these don’t seriously impede momentum or clarity. Line-level craft is solidly publishable with room for refinement rather than overhaul.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level writing is polished: strong verbs and concrete images carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with little scaffolding. Figurative language is rich but mostly disciplined, rarely crowding out clarity, and there are no obvious synonym loops or template cadences. Pacing is well managed for a lyric piece, with descriptive density in calmer sections and a subtle tightening near the lantern’s shattering. At times the prose flirts with purple, but it remains legible and purposeful rather than indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character, and there is little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are generally apt and grounded in the world’s physicality, and the prose modulates well between dense description and forward motion. There are mild tendencies toward purple in stacked abstractions (“unused potential pooled,” “unfiltered awakening”) but not enough to blur sense or stall momentum. Syntax and paragraphing provide a clear, propulsive read with no evident loops or technical errors.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful, with images that generally cohere and avoid mixed-metaphor muddle (the opening dome/teeth image is especially strong). Information density is high without significant padding, and most figurative language does double duty for mood and theme. There are mild repetitions (“surprise never waning”) and a few near-thesis lines that read more like commentary than dramatization, but they do not materially drag momentum. No major artifacts or loops interfere with clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is tight, rhythmically varied, and usually high-density—most sentences do at least two jobs (image plus psychology, or action plus theme). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically aligned; it rarely lapses into purple or redundancy. There are no significant scaffold loops or clarity issues, and the closure image lands cleanly. A few metaphors (“sieved hush,” “ghost fingers”) sit very close together early on, skirting but not crossing into over-stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are clear, modifiers are purposeful, and most sentences do at least two jobs (world-building plus mood, or theme plus character). Repetition is mostly deliberate (e.g., the “mist,” “sea,” and “mistakes into wisdom” threads) and does not sink into synonym churn or scaffolding. There are very few wasted or purely expository sentences, and the prose moves efficiently for a reflective piece. The primary limitation is that some thematic statements could be trimmed or sharpened to avoid a faintly didactic sheen.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly economical, with strong sensory grounding and recurring images (tide, poles, compass) doing multiple jobs. There are a few mildly familiar or on-the-nose constructions (“endless gray as his thoughts,” “weight of it suddenly unbearable”), and the navigation/gravity metaphors repeat without always adding new nuance. Still, there’s no real scaffold, loop, or figurative muddle; sentences largely advance character and mood together. The line-level craft is solidly above average but stops short of the razor-sharp precision expected at top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences are generally tight, varied, and purposeful; there is little scaffolding or repetition that feels like padding. A few phrases are familiar ("stains don’t wash out," "served the highest bidder"), but they don’t significantly blunt the impact. The rhythm supports mood, and images are usually clear and not over-stacked, with no figurative muddle in peak beats. Line-level craft is strong and publishable, if not yet strikingly original.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences have varied rhythm, vivid yet controlled imagery (“tears cutting silver paths,” “smoke curling into the shape of wings”), and very little redundancy. Most lines carry multiple loads—advancing plot, revealing character, and maintaining atmosphere—without feeling overwrought. A few abstractions (“a bond beyond death,” “a love that refused to unravel”) are slightly generic beside the otherwise concrete texture. Trimming those in favor of more specific images would lift this into an elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, worldbuilding) without obvious redundancy, and metaphors (“lost time pooled like mercury,” “language older than regret”) are mostly fresh and coherent. Rhythm varies nicely and there are no evident loops or scaffolding sentences; each line pushes atmosphere or insight forward. The density of figurative language approaches purple in places, but it remains intelligible and doesn’t blur causality or the closure image. A touch more spareness around the climax might heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is controlled and economical for a lyrical piece; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and advancing the ritual). Repetition (“The *Euthymia* had once been…”) is patterned rather than sloppy, and figurative language is generally precise and not overstacked. Rhythm modulates well from long, flowing description to shorter, declarative lines at key turns (“She didn’t flinch.” / “I’m trying”). A bit more sensory variety beyond the visual and conceptual could deepen immediacy, but there are no serious loops, muddled metaphors, or grammatical distractions.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and free of mechanical errors, with strong images like the bug’s light “flickering like a dying star” and the volcano’s ash “painting the sky in shades of fire.” Many sentences do double duty for mood and plot, and paragraphs generally carry forward momentum. There is some reliance on familiar poetic formulations (“rhythms older than time,” “world that had forgotten how to shine”) and lightly purple constructions, but they don’t obscure clarity. The final third maintains propulsion without noticeable scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clean, mostly lean, and each tends to carry multiple functions (world, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding. Imagery like the moss “pulsed faintly like a dying heartbeat” and the torch flaring against the wall is vivid but not overstacked. Repeated motifs (“spark,” “silence,” “glow”) feel deliberate rather than redundant, and there are no major loops, clichés, or figurative muddles. A slight tendency toward familiar revolution language (“call to arms,” “burn the city to the ground”) is the main limiter for top-band scores.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose carries strong rhythm and density—most sentences do more than one job, advancing both image and world logic. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and not so stacked as to become purple or obscure causality. There’s little in the way of loops or scaffolding; exposition is compact and integrated. Minor reliance on familiar emotional shorthand is the main thing keeping this shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, detail is dense, and most images do double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is a high metaphor density that occasionally leans purple (“lightning that split the sky into jagged fragments of violet and gold,” “seconds stretching like scars across skin”), but the vehicles are generally coherent and legible. Redundancy is minimal, and the prose maintains momentum despite being reflective. The slight overabundance of figurative flourishes in an already-lyric piece keeps this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly economical, with images like the perforations casting a “constellation of light” doing multiple jobs. There is some repetition of core formulations (questions/destinations, duel/conversation) but not enough to drag momentum. Figurative language is controlled and rarely purple; it stays legible and grounded in the scene’s concrete objects. No significant scaffolding, syntactic monotony, or artifact loops interfere with clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and purposeful metaphors that rarely feel strained. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; almost every sentence advances either character, atmosphere, or stakes. The figurative pattern of decay vs. bloom (“took root in the cracks,” “words waiting to bloom”) is coherent and not over-stacked. A few lines edge toward slogan (“if you fed it enough ink”) but do not significantly dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “dark as spilled ink” or compasses “spinning like drunken dancers” are clear, apt, and not overstacked. Nearly every sentence advances character, mood, or world-building with good information density and minimal redundancy. The prose stays just shy of purple; figurative language has internal coherence and rarely clutters the action, including at the climax. Rhythm on the page supports momentum, and there are no noticeable mechanical errors or template cadences.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are clear, metaphors mostly precise, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every line either advances atmosphere, character, or premise. The pacing breathes where it should (dream sequence, reading the pages) without stalling momentum. A few phrases feel familiar or slightly over-explained (“her voice like wind through dry reeds,” “her voice trembling”), but these are minor and don’t obscure cause/effect or dull the closing image. Overall information density and clarity are high, comfortably above most submissions.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in length, often doing double-duty for setting and interiority, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is generally apt, cohesive, and not overstacked for this meditative tempo. Information flow is clear; each paragraph either deepens mood, advances the magical process, or sharpens Elias’s internal position. The prose occasionally leans close to purple, but it stays controlled enough not to blur sense or dull the closure image.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is functional but marred by significant clichés ("cracked like spiderwebs," "skeleton of its former self," "groaning like a ship at sea") that indicate a lack of line-level rigor. These artifacts dilute the imagery and prevent the density required for the highest echelon of quality.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm is controlled and propulsive, with good attention to sensory imagery. However, the integration of required phrases (e.g., "scorched testament") feels grafted on, creating slight textural bumps in an otherwise smooth surface.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally competent but marred by tautological phrasing ("expression silently expressive") and adjectival stacking. The reliance on stock metaphors ("pulse of progress") reduces the impact of the stronger imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished and readable but dampened by filter verbs ("He knew," "He saw," "He felt") and some cliché imagery ("fractured rainbows"). The sentence rhythm is competent, but the density of telling reduces the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is heavily reliant on clichés and stock imagery ("whispering secrets to the wind," "tightened like a noose," "dusk bled into twilight," "barely more than a sigh"). These received phrases flatten the emotional impact and obscure the specific reality of the story, falling below the standard for elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and evocative, though it occasionally leans into melodramatic phrasing ("twilight bled"). There is a reliance on summary to convey key information ("The method had come to her...", "She had healed them...") rather than dramatizing these realizations in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose has momentum but relies on a few noticeable clichés ("warm as a heartbeat," "forbidden texts") and register slips ("hyperbolic geometry") that detract from the otherwise polished gothic aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is competent with good rhythm, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("weight of hope") and logic-defying descriptors. The brevity of the piece (under the expected range) forces a summary-like cadence in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is polished and evocative, with high information density in imagery ("hulls split open like overripe fruit"). Rhythms are well-modulated to match the contemplative pace. Minor risk of adjective density in the descriptions of colors, but it remains functional within the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is saturated with cliché similes ("trembling like leaves," "beating like a drum," "ringing like a bell") and decorative metaphors that obstruct clarity. The density of figurative language in low-pressure moments creates a purple texture that dulls the story's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.0)
    Competent sentence construction is undermined by repetitive subject-verb openings ("He adjusted," "He traced," "He exhaled"). The climax hinges on a derivative line ("cracks were where the light got in") that reduces the impact of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from a high density of cliché metaphors ("gnawed... like a trapped rat," "rough as sandpaper") and overwriting ("blade honed on the whetstone of necessity"). Diagnostic phrasing ("betrayal was transformative") replaces active description, slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe stylistic artifact: the "not [X], but [Y]" construction appears over 10 times in the latter half, creating a monotonous, list-like cadence that destroys momentum. Repetitive descriptors ("marbled hush," "ambered hush") further clutter the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and readable with good rhythm, but suffers from some shopworn imagery ("glistened... like a shattered mirror," "crack like breaking glass"). The line-level craft is functional but lacks the freshness required for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally competent but leans into purple phrasing ("fracture in the silence," "light like a promise"). These metaphors clutter the emotional beats, and the "crystal whispering" phrase disrupts the otherwise grounded lexical set.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but relies on several stock images ("brittle as old parchment," "knees popping like dry twigs," "sun bled into the horizon"). While competent, the line-level craft lacks the startling freshness required for the highest bands, and occasionally leans on adverbs ("wisely," "carefully") to direct the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally competent but suffers from forced phrasing to accommodate prompt elements, most notably the sentence fragment "A subdued awakening," which disrupts the rhythmic flow. Some descriptions tilt toward "purple" overwriting without adding sufficient informational density.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by filter verbs ("saw," "knew," "understood") and cliché similes ("bleeding... like tears"); these artifacts distance the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from moments of overwriting and purple phrasing, such as "auroral sorrow of dawn" and "sky bleeds light." These descriptions draw attention to themselves rather than the scene. The "fault-tolerant oracle" terminology is a highlight of linguistic precision amidst some abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is functional but marred by clunky similes ("knife through stale bread") and stock phrases ("rusted bones groaning") that dampen the literary quality. While readability is high, the line-level craft relies on familiar descriptors and occasionally veers into melodrama ("louder than any confession").

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is rhythmic and generally clear, with some strong imagery (&quot;forgotten tooth&quot;). However, it relies occasionally on familiar similes (&quot;gnarled as roots&quot;) and filter structures (&quot;she realized,&quot; &quot;she knew&quot;) that slightly dilute the immediacy of the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose relies on a high density of stock similes ("fine as spider silk," "golden as dawn light," "like a half-remembered dream"). Sentence structures are repetitive, often leading with "Elias [verb]," creating a monotonous rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from severe simile churn (over 10 instances of "like" or "as if" in a short text), creating a "template cadence" artifact that dilutes imagery. This reliance on comparison rather than direct sensory experience stalls momentum and triggers the pattern-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pivotal beats are weakened by clichés ("unfurled like a flower," "stomach dropped," "hidden in plain sight"). Some figurative language is muddled (a visual beam compared to an auditory metronome counting inaudible time), reducing the prose's immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from clichés ("shiver through his spine," "sharp as a blade") and awkward integration of required phrases that break the flow. The line "Through rhetorical devices" disrupts the diegesis, reading as a prompt constraint rather than organic narration.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose leans into "purple" description ("frozen breath," "fractured prisms," "molten") and abstract equations ("absorbed... resolve") that reduce precision. Line-level momentum is stalled by the reliance on summary and adjective-heavy static description.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is weakened by clichés ("sound like breaking glass," "snapped back") and summary-telling ("He felt whole") at crucial moments. The meta-commentary on "procedural generation" disrupts the immersive texture, reading as authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("screaming into the void," "hollow ache," "cut through the fog") and tautologies ("audibly muted"). Heavy-handed phrasing ("filament of hush") pushes the style into purple territory, obscuring the scene's physical reality behind abstract emotional signifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose has a strong rhythm and good sensory density, but is marred by occasional overwriting and odd word choices. The phrase "credibly curious" reads like a malapropism (likely meant "incredibly" or "curably"?), and the ending relies on abstract summaries of emotion rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mechanics are clean, but the prose relies on stock simile constructions ("like liquid twilight," "like dry leaves") that reduce freshness. The phrase "aromatically cautious" reads as an awkward insertion that tells rather than shows a sensory sensitivity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by significant clichés ("onion," "reeds") and abstract filtering ("breath shallow with wonder"). The density of figurative language occasionally obscures the physical action, and the vision sequence relies on repetitive sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by clunky simile stacks in the opening ("ribs like... like...") and stock phrasing ("silent sentinels," "bones of the earth") that dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés ("pulsing like a living heart," "ink bleeding through parchment," "swallowing his silhouette") and purple phrasing ("golden breath"). The grammatical error with "subsume" further undermines the polish required for this level.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally clear but marred by heavy adjectival stacking ("shrewd seaside cargo broker instincts") and prompt-echoing labels ("cautious exuberance") that disrupt flow. These artifacts reduce narrative momentum and read as scaffold rather than polished craft.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose leans into purple territory with modifier-heavy descriptions ("jagged edge," "cold air," "living light," "fractured sky") and elaborate similes ("like the whispers of lost languages") that slow momentum. The writing is polished but dense, prioritizing ornamentation over directness, particularly in the emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is competent but leans on stock imagery ("glinted under the pale moon") and a vague exit strategy ("dissolved into light"). The rhythm is functional, though the density of "mysterious" adjectives occasionally flattens the precision of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is polished but dense with filter verbs ("Elias felt," "Elias knew") and abstract nouns. The reliance on cliché imagery ("ghost of her hand," "door left ajar") reduces the vividness of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from several stock phrases ("shadows that stretched like fingers," "sent a jolt") and a repetitive loop ("frayed edges of his own frayed existence") that dulls the impact. These artifacts lower the ceiling significantly despite clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally competent with good rhythm, but suffers from occasional clichés ("half gasp, half laugh," "pulsing faintly") and some precious phrasing ("quiet revolutions"). The phrase "circuitously sincere" reads as an overwritten modifier that momentarily stalls momentum rather than sharpening the image.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose relies on stock similes ("trapped like an insect in sap," "oil on water") and forced abstract-concrete zeugma ("patched with tar and hope"). These artifacts distract from otherwise clean mechanics and dampen the imagery's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is polished with strong imagery ("shadows grew teeth"), though the required phrase "steadily unpredictable" is syntactically awkward and feels inserted rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is generally readable but suffers from momentum-killing backstory blocks and "tell" sentences ("Liora was reactively visionary"). Filter verbs ("she saw," "she tasted") occasionally distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is functional but prone to overwriting and cliché (e.g., "swallowing the streetlights whole," "hinges groaning like a waking beast"). While information density is adequate, the reliance on melodramatic verbs and adjective stacks creates a slightly purple texture that distracts from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by literary clichés ("threads in a tapestry," "symphony," "rising like an unheard symphony") and abstract summaries ("whispers of entangled memories"). The reliance on telling—summarizing the emotional import rather than showing the sensory details—flattens the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés and stock phrasing ("smirk sharp enough to cut," "voice... like hushed thunder," "chorus of the damned"). The reliance on abstract modifiers ("eerie," "latent," "unseen") weakens the immediacy and density of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and readable with good rhythm. However, relying on stock imagery like "drink the light" and "map of old bruises" prevents entry into the highest bands. The mechanics are clean, but the prompt insertions in the final paragraphs feel slightly less integrated than the rest.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is overburdened with abstract metaphors ("stained with ink and patience," "thin as veins") that clutter the imagery without adding precision. High density of scaffold sentences ("He was here to," "He sought to") slows momentum. Clichéd phrasing ("silence was its own kind of noise," "whispering secrets") reduces the impact of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is competent and rhythmic but marred by several stock phrasings (&quot;trembling... like a leaf,&quot; &quot;fluorescent glow,&quot; &quot;jagged labyrinth&quot;) that reduce freshness. The imagery of the fused book is excellent, but the opening similes lack the same specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear but suffers from logical lapses in imagery (the "clinking" shell, the preserved cello strings) that distract from the scene. Phrasing occasionally slips into telling via oxymoron ("gloomy cheerfulness") instead of evoking the complex emotion through action.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is readable but dense with stock metaphors and clichés ("circling like vultures," "burden she carried like a second skin," "trust was a currency"). While the rhythm is smooth, the reliance on familiar phrases and summary blunts the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but frequently relies on clichés ("fragile marble," "sound so small it might as well have been a sigh") that dull the imagery. Over-reliance on familiar "space sublime" metaphors prevents the line-level craft from reaching higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with a consistent, somewhat lyrical tone. There are minor clichés ("curled... like a living thing"), but the sentence-level mechanics are solid. Momentum is maintained, though the density of "poetic" observation sometimes slows the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is generally competent but suffers from "telling" in key moments, most notably the verbatim insertion of prompt phrases like "subtly confident" which weaken the description. Some metaphors work well, but others, like condensation streaking "like tears," lean toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose has a steady rhythm but relies on stock similes ("silent as tombs") and abstract poeticisms that obscure concrete action. These text artifacts reduce the immediacy of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the prose flows well, it relies too heavily on stock phrases and clichés ("moth to flame," "honeyed poison," "liquid starlight," "space between stars"). These familiar metaphors dull the impact of otherwise competent writing and reduce the unique texture of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    Imagery is vivid ("broken tooth"), but the prose occasionally drifts into abstraction ("sustained impossibilities", "salt and time") which weakens the line-level impact. The mandatory phrase "copperlight repose" is integrated, albeit with slightly forced syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from high simile density ("like honey," "like a rat," "like a name," "like dying stars"), creating a repetitive syntactic cadence. The register break at "cameo appearances" disrupts the immersive quality of the line work.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    Metaphor density is high (ribs, moth's wing, splinter, syrup, forge, drumbeat), creating a "scaffolding" effect that slows momentum. The prose is polished but draws too much attention to its own construction, occasionally blurring the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and readable with good sensory grounding ("salt spray," "blistered"). The writing relies heavily on simile constructions ("like a waking sleeper," "like ink in water," "like an old man"), which creates a slightly repetitive cadence, but clarity and momentum remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is functional but marred by "purple" overwriting and mixed metaphors. Phrases like "caught the light like a whisper" (synesthesia that blurs rather than sharpens) and "cathedral of forgotten dreams" (cliché) detract from the otherwise solid imagery. The "ghostly trail" simile is another stock artifact that lowers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.0)
    Sentence-level mechanics are clean, but the paragraphs rely on "and then" sequencing ("The next morning," "By nightfall," "Three days later") that kills momentum. The prose often tells rather than shows ("fingers deftly weaving," "alive with tension"), preventing the reader from experiencing the sensory reality of the scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is polished and functional, it suffers from several clichés that detract from literary prestige ("fingers of a drowning man," "eyes unreadable," "fragile as the first light of dawn"). These stock images flatten the emotional impact of key moments. The rhythm is generally good, but the imagery needs more freshness to reach the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from "lit-fic" signaling and clichés ("ghostly fingers," "siren's song"). Metaphors are occasionally mixed or imprecise ("unspools like a tangled net"—nets untangle, spools unspool). Phrases like "lotus-hearted ache" drift into purple prose that obscures emotional clarity rather than enhancing it.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is burdened by a high density of clichés in the opening ("skeletal apple trees," "gnarled fingers," "liquid gold," "lodged... like a splinter"). While grammatically sound, the reliance on stock imagery prevents the scene from feeling vivid or singular. The sentence rhythm is readable but lacks propulsion during the developing scene.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally polished, featuring strong imagery ("bell flaring like a flower") and good rhythmic control. The score is held back slightly by a few reliance on filter verbs ("Elias heard," "Elias saw") and some cliché somatic phrasing in the climax ("breath came in ragged gasps") that dulls the otherwise sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is competent but marred by clichés and "tell" constructions ("grin that had charmed," "picture of ease," "bet with the universe"). The phrase "candidly cryptic" is noticeably clunky. The density of information is moderate, with some scaffolding visible.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from melodramatic clichés, most notably "ink still wet with the salt of his tears" and "fingers trembling not from cold but from..." These stock phrases undercut the unique imagery of the shell. The density is good, but the reliance on purple phrasing ("cathedral of salt") softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from excessive simile scaffolding, with "like [image]" constructions appearing in nearly every conceptual beat (frozen rainbows, ghost of a coin, smoke, fossil, sugar, word, mouth, sigh). This repetitive syntax dulls the imagery's impact and creates a formulaic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is polished and readable but heavily reliant on cliché somatic markers ("breath hitched," "pulse quickened," "hands shook") and stock similes ("curled like smoke," "swirling like a storm"). Repetitive sentence structures ("But tonight...") slightly drag the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by melodramatic similes ("glinting... like dried tears") and clunky modifier stacks ("slyly heartfelt"). The reliance on personification for the setting becomes repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with good sentence variety. There are minor lapses into cliché ("vanished like smoke," "sharp angles"), but the line-level craft generally supports the melancholic tone without impeding momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished with high density, though it leans heavily on abstract metaphors ("whispering of storms") that can feel slightly decorative. The recurrence of "fractured" (light, hush) borders on a repetitive artifact, and the explicit articulation of the prompt phrases in the narration creates a slight "scaffold" feel.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.6)
    The phrase "softly ingenious" is a jarring, tell-heavy artifact that disrupts prose flow and indicates forced prompt integration. Clichés like "heart pounding," "tight with urgency," and "dying star" reduce impact and indicate a lack of line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is marred by significant clichés (&quot;flickering like a candle in the wind,&quot; &quot;wound that had never healed&quot;) and filter verbs (&quot;she conjectured,&quot; &quot;she decided&quot;). Information density is low due to decorative overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, but relies on some "writerly" shortcuts like "liminal space" and "smeared with stars." The insertion of prompt phrases is visible and slightly stiff, though not fatal to the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from adjective-heavy descriptions and cliché similes ("lover’s whisper"). The insertion of prompt-specific phrases like "moonstone cabochon dust speck" creates rhythmic stumbles and noun pileups that disrupt the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.4)
    The writing is readable but marred by clichés ("moth to a flame," "breath... like mist," "prison for the light") that dull the imagery. Sentence structures are functional but repetitive, often following a pattern of observation followed by abstract reflection. There are no major technical errors, but the prose lacks the density and freshness required for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is mechanically clean but marred by significant clichés in key descriptions ("liquid mercury," "shattered dreams," "voice rough as bark"). These artifacts reduce the freshness of the imagery and the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is marred by clichés ("salt and time," "marrow of her bones") and filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Line-level momentum is stalled by over-description ("glistened," "etched," "smoothed") that does not advance the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose relies heavily on stock similes ("static before a storm", "breath hitched") and awkward telling ("his sensitively perceptive nature prickling") that disrupts immersion; the density of clichés weakens the literary texture.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is dense but suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and mixed metaphors (mirrors don't usually have "borrowed heartbeats"). The misuse of "perceptively" for "perceptibly" is a significant line-level flaw for a high-end literary market, signaling a lack of editorial precision.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.1)
    Competent surface polish is undermined by pervasive clichés ("struck deeper than any blade," "as if reading her thoughts," "somewhere in the distance"). These artifacts flatten the prose density and rob the moment of freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally competent but suffers from repetitive sentence structures in the backstory section ("He had paid," "He kept," "He had chosen"). There is a reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("distant, rumbling lull," "faint, sickly light") that slows momentum without adding necessary density.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("blanket of snow," "calm before a storm," "broken heart") and awkward phrasing ("bodily poetic grace") forced by the prompt. Heavy use of abstract nouns weakens the line-level impact and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("rusted ribs groaning," "shadows that danced like puppets"), creating a solid atmospheric layer. However, the text relies on "telling" constructions ("She knew better," "That was the power of...") and some slightly purple phrasing ("meteor hush," "spilling out like ink") that draws attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by a clichéd final image ("space between the beats of a heart") and some mixed metaphors ("mist... like smoke from a doused fire") that weaken the closing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.5)
    Phrasing is often awkward or overwrought (e.g., "technically gentle in his hands" is a usage error for an inanimate object). The reliance on clichés like "river of sound" and "sleeping god" dilutes the vividness of the core concept. The dense adjectival layering slows momentum without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.2)
    Line-level craft is functional but marred by clichés ("ribs of some great, slumbering beast") and awkward phrasing forced by the prompt ("come to the bunker precisely playful"). The prose creates a mood but lacks the precision required for higher bands, relying on familiar metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is often vivid, distinct register drifts ("empirically ironic" and "schematic representations") clash jarringly with the ancient Babylonian context. Additionally, the description of the magical figure relies on fantasy clichés ("robes the color of twilight," "voice like wind through reeds") that lack the freshness found elsewhere in the descriptions of the palace.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is polished but frequently overwrites emotional beats with heavy-handed similes ("like the trust she had spent years carefully dismantling"). While the rhythm is functional, the reliance on abstract nouns and "therapy-speak" creates a distance that dulls the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.0)
    The required phrase "Through synchronized breathing" is repeated with identical syntax, creating a noticeable scaffold artifact. While the imagery is pretty, the prose tends toward the ornate ("ribs of a dying bird") without always advancing the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is competent but occasionally decorative or tells rather than shows (e.g., "endearingly feisty"). Some metaphors ("vows... turned deciduous") hover on the edge of abstraction without deepening the immediate reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is functional but marred by significant clichés ("staring into the abyss," "pieces... snapped into place"). The specific phrase "brightened disquiet" is used twice in a short span—once as an internal state and once as a setting descriptor—creating a distracting echo.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.2)
    Reliance on telling ("She was carefully resourceful") weakens characterization, and the prose suffers from mixed or vague imagery ("loomed like a forgotten thought"). The integration of required phrases results in clunky, non-idiomatic constructions at pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is competent but relies on standard similes ("like a ghost") and occasionally overwrought modification ("blissfully aberrant," "quiet waves"). The use of the required phrase "narrative threads" is mechanically inserted as a transitional summary, temporarily flattening the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished and readable, with smooth sentence rhythm. However, it relies on stock somatic reactions ("breath caught," "hands trembled") to convey emotion, and some imagery borders on cliché ("weight of centuries"). The integration of the required phrase "translating confusion into clarity" feels inserted as a summary of action rather than an organic observation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is readable but relies on stock phrasing and physiological clichés ("breath misting," "heartbeat slowed to a whisper," "breath hitched") that dilute the scene's immediacy. The reliance on standard adjective-noun pairings reduces textural density.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose relies on several noticeable clichés ("frozen tears," "bones picked clean by time," "dry leaves skittering") that dull the imagery. While the rhythm is functional, these stock phrases prevent the writing from achieving the intended literary density.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    Imagery is evocative ("fog... solid enough to carve"), though metaphor density occasionally slows propulsion. Line-level craft is high, with no obvious scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract genitive phrases ("scent of promise and danger," "gravity of hopelessness") and familiar clichés ("swallowed her whole," "licking at her fingers"). These artifacts reduce the density and freshness of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphor density in the opening ("yawned," "prickled," "skin of a sleeping beast" in one sentence). Stock physical beats ("gasped," "thrumming in her throat") and stage directions ("brushing the sand from her knees") reduce the line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery throughout. The phrase "intangibly tangible" (likely a required element) reads as an oxymoronic stumble that momentarily disrupts the otherwise smooth flow. No scaffold loops or drag; sentence variety is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with a clear focus on sensory detail. Some metaphors land softly or feel slightly mixed ("fluidly logical as breathing"), but the line-level craft is competent.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is weighed down by adjective stacking and clichés ("pulse quickened," "descending into darkness"). The density of modifiers impedes momentum, and the rhythm is repetitive, lacking the propulsive syntax required for a discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is functional but laden with clichés ("swallowed by silence," "gentle hands," "trembling hand"). The phrasing "teach suffocating to breathe" feels like a raw prompt constraint inserted into dialogue without sufficient naturalization.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally strong with evocative imagery ("jagged pixels where the words flickered like a dying screen"). There are minor clichés ("sound like a held breath released"), but the line-level craft efficiently advances the story and maintains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by purple phrasing ("first yawn of evening," "exhaled its last breath") and reliance on telling ("His motivation was simple"). The phrase "eloquently silent" is an oxymoron that reads as pretentious rather than insightful, and the "muse struck" line highlights a lack of causal connective tissue.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is functional but suffers from abstract noun-heavy descriptions ("breath of unseen things," "untold futures") that lower density. The insertion of "factually mystical" creates a significant register clash that disrupts the line-level rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is heavy with stock phrases and dead metaphors ("buried beneath bureaucratic ink," "heart ached," "weight of unknown histories"). Scaffolding verbs ("He decided to," "He wondered") distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is readable but heavily burdened by somatic clichés ("breath shallow," "stomach twist," "heart hammering," "eyes gleaming"). These stock phrases flatten the physical immediacy of the scene, preventing the sensory writing from achieving a literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is polished but marred by clichés ("heavy with more than just brass," "lodged in his bones like a splinter") and vague abstractions ("something older, something like memory"). Line-level momentum is stalled by a reliance on adjectival stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from adjective stuffing and awkward verbatim prompt insertions; "moonstone cabochon dust speck" is a logical and rhythmic clunker that disrupts the sentence. The reliance on abstract phrasing ("hush where past meets prophecy") obscures the immediate physical reality of the scene, replacing sensory precision with vague poeticism.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is grammatically clean but relies on clichés ("swallowing him whole," "lost to time," "eyes sharp with recognition"). There is a lack of density; sentences often restate emotional beats that were already established. Rhythmic variation is adequate but rarely propels the action.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose suffers from "purple" descriptors ("bruised twilight," "ceaseless drizzle") that clutter the opening. The phrase "factually mystical" is tonally jarring and reads like an unintegrated artifact, breaking the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from cliché ("cut through the gloom like a blade") and mixed metaphors ("bled a hidden sunrise... like spilled ink"). The density of adjectives slows the pacing without adding sufficient informational weight.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is mechanically clean and flows well, but relies on familiar phrasing ("flexed his fingers," "braced himself"). The writing is functional but lacks the density or rhythmic propulsion required for the highest bands; the "floating equations" imagery feels derivative.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. However, the density of figurative language ("like mist through cracks," "like a heartbeat," "like curtains") approaches overwriting in the climactic beats, slightly cluttering the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and readable with good rhythm, though marred by occasional clichés ("skeletal remains"). The phrasing "last ascent" in the opening is slightly ambiguous (implying finality/death) for a story about a repair that succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes ("like prisms," "like wet paper," "like wind," "as a starless sky," "like constellations," "like smoke," "like liquid silver," "like icicles"). This structural artifact creates a predictable cadence that distracts from the otherwise competent writing.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. Phrases like "burnished sorrow" lean toward the ornamental but fit the established aesthetic. The sentence-level craft effectively supports the atmospheric weight of the story without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose suffers from purple phrasing ("patches of twilight," "covenant of rust") and repetitive sentence structures (Subject-Verb openers). The insertion of prompt phrases feels awkward and mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally polished, but the sentence "The psychometry reading came unbidden" is a jarring register break that reads like a game mechanic instruction amidst lyrical prose. "Bruised twilight" leans on familiar descriptor tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose has a strong rhythmic quality and polish ("edges worn smooth by centuries of tides"). However, it occasionally leans into "purple" abstraction ("scaffolding complexity with simplicity") that values sound over precise meaning, slightly slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is polished but marred by logical slips (seasonal contradiction) and forced phrasing ("dawning hush" at night) that disrupts clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("sharp as flint," "cold as a corpse's touch") and modifier-heavy description. "Retrocognitively trapped" is a significant dialogue artifact that disrupts naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is rhythmic and generally clear, but marred by stock phrasing ("skeleton of itself," "weight of time") and register drift ("molecules had shifted") that clashes with the fantasy atmosphere. These artifacts dilute the otherwise solid line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is competent with some strong images, but frequently relies on filter verbs ("He understood then," "He thought") that dull immediacy. The final line ("And he was just getting started") is a tonal artifact that clashes with the preceding lyricism, reading more like a genre thriller hook than a literary resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose has rhythm but suffers from cliché ("scattered diamonds," "ghost of a smile") and forced phrasing ("furiously tranquil energy"). The reliance on standard adjective-noun pairings prevents the imagery from achieving a truly literary texture.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("felt it in her bones," "world splitting open") and the unidiomatic forced usage of "credibly curious." These artifacts lower the ceiling for line-level craft despite good pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose relies heavily on simile scaffolding ("like a forgotten prayer," "like a shattered constellation," "like a shadow," "like an old friend," "like a relic") which creates a repetitive cadence. Clichéd phrasing ("breath caught," "didn't hesitate") and abstract descriptors reduce line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.8)
    Line-level craft is marred by clichés ("sun bled," "flickering like candle flames") and awkward phrasing forced by prompt elements ("tranquilly perceptive," "contextual clues"). These artifacts distract from the otherwise functional prose and lower the density of fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.3)
    While mechanically clean, the prose relies on cliché metaphors ("slipped through his fingers like sand," "air itself had thickened into honey"). These stock phrases flatten the imagery and reduce the potential for a unique textural experience.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor stacking ("burnished hush," "lace," "oil," "stained glass" all in the opening). The literal sense is often obscured by figurative density, culminating in the confusing physical status of the "ink" and "page" at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with a gentle cadence that mirrors the protagonist's work. There are moments of overwriting ("roots entwined with his bones") and some reliance on standard imagery ("color of autumn leaves"), but the line-level craft is generally competent.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is competent with a smooth rhythmic flow, particularly in descriptive passages. However, imagery occasionally relies on familiar tropes ("swallowed by ... time," "shimmering like liquid copper") that reduce freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from indefinite similes ("something like a promise," "something older") and familiar phrasing ("skeletal remains," "forgotten tongue"). These artifacts dull the imagery and reduce the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from high simile density and clichés ("groaning under the weight of time," "skeletal remains"). A direct contradiction occurs in the description of the "wild hush" being broken by "wind howling" (a howl precludes a hush), and the phrasing "distance were just another kind of lie" reads as abstract filler.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is dense with "literary" clichés ("frozen breath against the void," "pulsing like a heartbeat," "fabric of time") and mixed metaphors. Significant label-speak artifacts ("confusion became clarity") in the final third flatten the emotional impact of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally competent with good rhythm, but marred by cliché physical reactions ("breath fogged," "heartbeat") and the awkward modifier stack "sacredly playful." Line-level momentum is preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and mixed metaphors ("vein of forgotten breath") alongside clichés ("cracked open like an egg"); the density of similes slows momentum without adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.8)
    A severe template cadence artifact ("Not the soft... but the ones," "Not the mountain... but the place," "Not the books... but the ones") appears eight times, creating a droning, rhetorical rhythm that kills momentum. This repetitive scaffolding distracts significantly from the otherwise competent imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high information density and strong imagery like the "breath of frost." The text avoids scaffolding artifacts, though "winnowed like chaff" is a slightly standard idiom in an otherwise fresh textural landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is competent but suffers from "purple" tendencies and mixed metaphors ("swallowed sound whole," "chorus of ghosts"). While there are moments of nice rhythm, the reliance on stock phrases ("raw and real," "unravel empires," "mend broken souls") flattens the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from a high density of "like" similes (dying beast, twin voids, quilt, spectral fingers, diver), creating a repetitive syntactic cadence. This reliance on comparative scaffolding distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is competent and often beautiful ("sloped downward like a sigh"), but marred by recognizable clichés that lower the literary ceiling. Phrases like "swallowed the last of his youth whole" and the stock beat "He had not realized he was holding his breath" detract from the otherwise high density and specificity of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is burdened by a high density of clichés and stock metaphors ("stood sentinel," "rough as driftwood," "howled like a thing alive," "bled into the sky"), which significantly dulls the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.3)
    Line-level craft is functional but weighed down by modifier-heavy descriptions and clichés ("frozen mid-swing," "ghost in the receiver," "answer without hesitation"). The rhythm is often static, relying on familiar "adjective-noun" pairings that dampen the prose's vitality.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished but marred by the anachronistic therapy-speak artifact "psychological safety" in a genre setting. The writing occasionally relies on clichés ("groaned like a living thing") and expository summaries of emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from worn clichés ("ghostly fingers," "insistent as the tide") that dull the imagery. There is a tendency toward list-like sentence structures ("The things the stranger hadn’t done... The things he had done") that slows momentum without adding density.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is competent and rhythmical in the opening, but suffers from abstract descriptors ("something akin to hope") in high-stakes moments. The phrase "empirically intuitive" is a semantic error that disrupts clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers from significant simile density ("like a restless child," "like dying embers," "like polished obsidian," "like wind through reeds"), creating a repetitive syntactic cadence that distances the reader. Several images rely on stock phrases ("old blood," "cathedral of light") rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from forced prompt insertions (e.g., "palette of resolve") that disrupt the metaphoric logic. Some phrasing leans toward purple ("pooled like molten copper"), and the density of adjectives slows momentum without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density ("ink had bled... swimming as if the past itself resisted"). Some imagery leans toward the overwrought ("logs groaning like an old man remembering wars he never fought"), but the line-level craft sustains the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes (6+ instances of "like a..." in a short space), creating a "scaffolding" effect that dulls immediacy. Phrases like "like a forgotten promise" and "wind through reeds" border on cliché. While the rhythm is smooth, the figurative clutter distracts from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose has strong rhythm and density ("crystallized at the tip"), but leans on clichés ("world held its breath," "scars... etched into her skin"). The line-level craft is polished but suffers from occasional overwriting that tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished but occasionally dense with similes ("knew better than his own reflection," "cracked like dried leaves," "like a firefly"), creating a slight workshop-template feel. The climax is handled well with sensory precision ("sizzling as it hit the copper wire"), though the dialogue in the resolution feels a bit staged.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from high-density metaphor usage that obscures clarity ("each particle a syllable of time unspoken") and relies on clichés ("ribs of a forgotten god"). Several prompt phrases ("wanderingly exact," "resounding hush") are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the natural rhythm. There is a lack of concrete, sensory verb-work in favor of abstract description.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.6)
    Several line-level artifacts detract from the polish: "clocks stuttered like a man with a stuttering heart" is a tautological loop, and phrases like "weight of time better than most knew their own names" and "pain was bright, clean" lean on cliché. "He began through counting" is a minor syntactic stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally clean but relies on repetitive phrasing; "quiet wildfire" is used as a mechanical bookend in the first and last paragraphs. Occasional overwriting ("measure the weight of a shadow") prioritizes poetic sound over precise meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally dense and sensory ("ink bleeding into vinyl"), maintaining good momentum. However, the phrase "clover melancholy" reads as a forced inclusion that breaks semantic logic, acting as a visible artifact rather than an organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high-quality imagery like "metronome for grief." A few standard phrases ("thin as a whisper," "pulse of the city") prevent the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level craft is generally competent, but several required phrases ("when context changed," "proximate causes") are inserted clumsily, creating register clashes. The climax suffers from abstraction ("proximate causes") right at the moment of highest emotional weight. These artifacts disrupt the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished with good rhythm, though it occasionally lapses into clichés ("shard of frozen starlight") or abstract telling ("shield against the weight of his own solitude"). Clarity is high, but the density of "telling" reduces immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished with good rhythm, though it leans toward abstraction in key moments ("sound that was almost visible"). The use of "thickened like honey" constitutes a standard cliché that dilutes the otherwise specific sensory imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished with high density and evocative imagery ("ink bled... like a living thing"). The sentence rhythm varies effectively. Some prompt phrases ("contingent relationships") feel slightly expository, but the overall craft is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.5)
    Line-level craft is hampered by "workshop" clichés (shimmering waters, silence humming) and abstract phrasing. There is a lack of concrete nouns and active verbs, with the prose relying on adjective-heavy descriptions to carry weight. The writing feels polished but safe, lacking the distinct texture required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose relies on clichés ("old secrets", "relentless pursuit", "eyes fever-bright") and mixed metaphors ("volcanic tenderness"). The phrase "analytically intuitive mind" is a prose artifact that disrupts immersion by summarizing a trait that should be demonstrated through action.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm is generally strong, but repetitive imagery ("liquid starlight" in intro, "liquid silver" later) and passive constructions ("restraints snapped") dull the line-level impact. Some phrasing relies on standard sensory shorthand ("smelled like ozone") that misses opportunities for fresher description.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the prose is functional and has moments of strong imagery ("scars" on the map), it relies heavily on stock similes at pivotal moments ("hit... like a fist," "clear as a bell," "sharp as a blade"). These clichés flatten the emotional impact of the otherwise inventive climax.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mechanics are generally clean, but "spiralingly" is a clumsy adverbial construction that breaks rhythm, and the prose relies on explanatory telling ("The effect was mesmerizing") to assert impact.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished with a strong rhythmic flow ("slithered through the mist like smoke"), but it leans on familiar imagery and clichés ("world held its breath," "laughter still echoing"). While there are no major technical flaws, the density of standard figurative language ("like a chess piece") limits the freshness of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but constructed from stock imagery ("sigh" of doors, "waves on stone"); while free of mechanical errors, the density of clichés prevents the imagery from feeling fresh or specific.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from a high density of simile constructions ("like the hands of a clock," "like a dying breath," "like a wound," "as old bone"), which creates a repetitive cadence and verges on purple prose. While the "whittled... into nothing" line is strong, the reliance on "like/as" comparisons dilutes the immediacy of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is rhythmically competent but suffers from overwriting and high metaphor density ("veined with light like captured auroras") that slows momentum. There is a tendency toward template sentence structures ("She had come," "She had spent," "She began") that flattens the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("eyes held the sharp glint," "knew too much for her age") and the derivative use of famous lyrics. The brevity forces a reliance on summary over dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is polished but relies on filter verbs ("Elias noticed," "He had assumed") and clunky abstract descriptors ("powerfully gentle") that dilute immediacy. The information density is often low, with sentences serving as scaffolding for the prompt elements rather than driving action.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level craft is polished and legible, with generally clean mechanics. However, the prose relies on standard similes ("like a man chasing his own shadow," "vanished... like a breath") that lack freshness. The summary sections lower the information density, trading concrete action for generalized narration.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is polished, it suffers from a density of stock similes ("coiled like a sleeping serpent," "shimmered like oil," "like puzzle pieces") that blunt the imagery. The reliance on familiar metaphors prevents the line-level craft from reaching higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("shadow flickered," "pulse quickened," "thousand voices sighing"). The insertion of the phrase "across the end of innocence" is syntactically awkward and reads as a forced prompt inclusion. The "atoms of nostalgia" concept creates a mixed metaphor that distracts from the line-level clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.1)
    A clear repetitive loop ("softly deliberate" appears in paragraphs 2 and 6) signals a lack of line-level polish. Some phrasing leans toward the purple ("dared to glow"), reducing density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose flow is competent but marred by stock phrases ("mist curled like smoke") and significant clichés ("smile... didn’t reach his eyes"). The biological logic of trimming and gluing a live chameleon's tail without anesthesia creates a distracting credibility gap.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is strong with high information density and evocative imagery like sand catching light "like shattered glass." Rhythm is well-controlled, though some phrasing leans into purple territory ("clarity that felt like a betrayal") without sufficient grounding. Line-level mechanics are clean, maintaining momentum through the transition into the tunnel.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is competent but relies heavily on simile chains ("clung... like a second skin," "pooled like water," "like the weight of a held breath"). Some descriptors feel purple ("liquid silver," "heart in hibernation"), reducing the impact of the stronger, concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density ("scratches of a pen," "stardust... coiled tight like a spring") that often muddles the imagery rather than sharpening it. Rhythmic repetition and abstract phrasing weaken the momentum, resulting in "purple" description that tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is polished but lacks density, relying on familiar metaphors ("candle in the wind," "ripples") and filter phrases ("That’s when he saw it," "Elias understood") that distance the reader. The pacing is uniform, failing to use rhythmic variation to distinguish the mundane world from the surreal archive.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.5)
    While grammatically polished, the prose relies heavily on abstract nouns ("insight," "knowing," "certainty") to do emotional work that should be dramatized. Phrases like "torn through him like a storm" and "shifting shadows" lean on cliché, and the pacing is slowed by expository summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished and readable but relies heavily on abstractions ("monotony of routines," "mist and memory") and familiar imagery ("light bled," "shadows danced"). While rhythmic, the text lacks the concrete, idiosyncratic detail required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose relies on clichés ("precision of a metronome," "silence was a living thing") and abstract metaphors ("frostbitten hope"). "Seraphically mundane" creates a register clash.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but marred by stock metaphors ("silent witness," "ghost of its intent") and occasional overwriting. The density of figurative language sometimes slows momentum without adding fresh imagery or necessary precision.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is functional but marred by distinct clichés (“woke with a start,” “breath hitched”) that dull key moments. While the rhythm is generally good, these stock phrases prevent the line-level craft from feeling fresh or precise.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but relies on "creative writing" stock phrases ("spilled mercury," "thrummed in her bones," "secrets to the wind"). While rhythmically competent, the writing lacks the freshness and density required for higher bands, often using adjectives to do the work of strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose suffers from stock phrasing ("lazy coils," "eyes wide with... hope," "smelled of lightning") that flattens the imagery. A recurring "coil" simile in the first half creates a minor repetitive loop.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is functional but marred by clichés ("sun bled into the sea," "funeral pyre") and an expository definition inserted into the narrative flow ("somatic markers—tiny, physical cues..."). These artifacts disrupt the immersive quality and reduce the line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.9)
    While polished, the prose leans on clichés ("swallowed him whole," "drowning in slow motion") and purple phrasing ("shape of the ache"). The density of metaphor slows narrative momentum without adding proportional insight or texture to the beats.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is heavily burdened by clichés ("chill ran down his spine," "mind racing," "acted on instinct," "half-remembered dream") that sap the story of literary freshness. These stock phrases replace precise, sensory observation, resulting in a generic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by stock phrasing ("settled into his bones," "swallowing the sound") and "telling" labels ("bravely conflicted"). The mix of abstract and sensory nouns ("scent of ozone and old secrets") creates a lack of precision in the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.8)
    Diction errors mar key moments; "inculcating" is an awkward, academic choice for gardening, and "senselessly perceptive" is an inefficient adverb-adjective cluster. Strained metaphors like "engraved quiet of her father’s initials" obscure meaning rather than enhancing it. The prose lacks rhythmic variety in the reflective sections.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose relies heavily on stock similes ("steady as the tide," "ribs of a sleeping giant," "like dying embers," "fingers of the dead") that dilute the imagery. These clichés in the opening paragraphs reduce the vividness of an otherwise imaginative setting.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the prose is evocative, it relies heavily on a repetitive paragraph-opening structure ("The observatory...", "The telescope...", "The journalist...", "The city...", "The observatory..."). Additionally, the density of "verb-like-a-noun" similes ("like a forgotten god," "like a warning," "like a dying man's breath") becomes formulaic and distracting.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from cliché ("echoed in his own bones") and mixed metaphors ("meteor hush... settling over him like snow," which conflates impact/heat with gentle cold). Additionally, the repetitive syntactic structure ("not by trade, but by necessity"; "Not by choice, but by cowardice") reads as a stylistic tic rather than a deliberate rhythmic device.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is competent but relies heavily on simile-driven description ("like forgotten dreams," "like a broken promise") that borders on cliché. The "socially perceptive" paragraph is an expository lump that slows momentum, though the rhythm generally supports the contemplative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is functional and descriptive but marred by mixed or standard metaphors ("lodged in her ribs like a splinter", "split like broken glass"). The forced integration of prompt phrases creates noticeable friction, and the oxymoron "warm coldness" reads as an error rather than a poetic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose has good rhythm and density, moving the story forward efficiently. However, there are minor artifacts of "story-speak" and cliché, such as "synesthetically blessed—or cursed," "broken glass," and "ripples spreading." The description "tasted like lightning" borders on melodramatic, but the line-level craft is generally competent and free of confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from a high density of stock similes ("like a promise," "like a live wire," "like a ghost," "like a heartbeat," "like a dream"), which dilute the imagery's impact. Additionally, the required phrase "fractally precise" is repeated verbatim within a short word count, creating a distracting echo. The writing is functional but relies too heavily on scaffolded comparisons.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is rhythmically strong and polished, with no major technical flaws. However, the reliance on synesthetic metaphors ("language that wasn't sound but pressure") and abstract emotion-labeling reduces immediate clarity in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but relies on somewhat familiar similes ("sharp as a blade," "glow like a captured sunset") that dilute the freshness. The mechanics are clean, but the density of figurative language occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is the story’s strength, with smooth rhythm and evocative imagery like "mist curled like smoke." While some metaphors verge on cliché ("valley stretched like a wound"), the prose is generally dense and propulsive. No significant scaffold or loop artifacts impede the reading.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    Line-level quality is severely damaged by the forced insertion of required phrases, resulting in tautologies and rhythm breaks (e.g., "gutters... tick like a metronome counting down the seconds until rain gutters stop ticking"). Phrasing like "noticed through ambient awareness" is abstract telling that disrupts the scene's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.1)
    Line-level craft is functional but marred by "tell" constructs ("Ren was phototropic...") and clumsy grammar in the pivotal simile ("As chimney smoke flattens [present]... so too did [past]..."). The prose frequently relies on scaffolded observation ("He had seen this before," "He understood then") rather than immediate, unfiltered experience.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is mechanically sound but saturated with clichés ("liquid silver," "holding its breath," "lifeline in a storm," "winter was coming"). These stock metaphors flatten the imagery and prevent the line-level craft from achieving a distinct, fresh texture.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose relies on clichés ("swallowed by time," "lost to the wind," "settled into her bones") and abstract scaffolding, preventing the imagery from feeling fresh or specific.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.5)
    A significant repetitive artifact lowers the score: the specific phrasing "whimsy so inevitable" / "whimsical and inevitable" appears three times, creating a distracting semantic loop. Prose is otherwise polished but occasionally overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished and readable, with clear sentence structures and no significant mechanical errors. It occasionally drifts into melodrama ("edge of revelation," "spaces between the stars") but maintains a steady, if standard, momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally functional, but the forced insertion of the prompt element "prudently adventurous" creates a jarring grammatical error ("He moved prudently adventurous"). This artifact significantly disrupts the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from repetitive imagery, specifically the overuse of "swallowing" (quarry swallowed, mist swallowed) and weak similes ("like a whisper," "like a curtain," "like smoke"). The description of the lance ("weapon's curve") contradicts the physical nature of a lance (a straight shaft), indicating a lack of precision in word choice. The writing is grammatically functional but stylistically clichéd.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is functional but marred by forced phrasing ("spongey dread") and repetitive simile structures ("clung... like a dying man," "vanished... like a man erased"). The reliance on abstract labels for emotion weakens the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.9)
    The text relies heavily on "purple" abstractions and dense figurative language ("clung... like a promise," "rusted into lace," "ashes of never") that stifle momentum. "Dynamically observant" is a jarring adverb-adjective label that breaks the literary tone. The density of metaphor obscures the scene's reality rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and readable, but relies on somewhat familiar similes ("beast too weary to move," "like a ship at sea"). These artifacts reduce the freshness of the imagery, though the rhythm and density remain professional.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with some evocative imagery ("petals brittle with age"). However, the score is capped by a tendency toward melodrama and "telling" artifacts, such as explicitly explaining the daylily metaphor instead of letting the image do the work, and using stock phrases like "fingers trembling."

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally evocative, but relies heavily on "noun + like/as + noun" similes (living thing, wet teeth, thread, ice, old blood), which creates a repetitive cadence. While the imagery is functional, this syntactic pattern dulls the line-level freshness slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is cluttered with simile density (four "like" comparisons in the first three paragraphs) that slows momentum and feels ornamental. The verbatim repetition of the specific phrase "anxious elation" (paragraphs 1 and 6) reads as a forced prompt insertion rather than an organic description, and the "diagnostic label-speak" ("purposefully curious") flattens character distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the rhythm is generally good, the integration of required phrases hampers clarity. "Breath fogging in the dusky resolve" treats an abstract emotion as a physical medium, creating a semantic stumble. "Fiercely gentle" is an oxymoronic adverb-adjective pair that feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and readable, with good rhythm. However, it relies on several clichés ("skidded into a ditch," "world went sideways," "yawned like an open wound") that reduce the freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is mechanically competent but weighed down by simile density and cliché ("shifted like a restless sea," "like a held breath," "like the scent of rain"). The reliance on "like" constructions dilutes the immediacy of the imagery, and the description of "haunted ambitions" as a scent is an awkward mixed metaphor that obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished with good rhythm and density. However, reliance on explaining prompt elements ("No one knew what that meant, exactly") and standard tropes ("language he knew... understood perfectly") creates minor drag and reduces freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density that stifles momentum ("like a secret heartbeat," "like fossilized prayers," "like fireflies"). This constant figurative layering distracts from the action and results in a overwritten texture that lacks breathing room.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("ledger of lost souls," "cauterize the guilt"). The rhythm supports the melancholic tone. The phrase "played to allude" (likely a prompt constraint) is the only slight stumble in naturalism, reading as syntactically forced.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose suffers from "telling" emotions ("breath shallow with cautious exuberance") and relies on clichés ("charge before a storm," "snake eating its tail"). The writing is functional but dense with adjectives and stock phrases that dull the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is functional with some strong imagery ("drank the midsummer twilight"), but is marred by clichés ("voice was warm, but his eyes were cold") and intrusive exposition that explains the magic system mid-action rather than trusting the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose relies heavily on decorative adjective-noun pairings ("silver thread," "fractured dreams," "quiet reverence") that lean toward purple. Several phrases drift into cliché ("time stretched thin," "heart aching"), and the density of figurative language often obscures the concrete reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the prose has rhythm ("hung like a bruise"), it relies heavily on abstract nouns (peace, forgiveness, memory) at pivotal moments. The final paragraph tells rather than shows ("She carried something new now—something like peace"), weakening the image.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from clunky insertion of prompt phrases ("deciphering wind chime selections," "protected vulnerability") which disrupt natural flow. Metaphors are frequent and occasionally mixed or cliché ("weight... like a secret"). The line-level craft is functional but lacks the density and freshness required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is functional but marred by cliché, starting with the opening line ("whispered secrets to the wind") and continuing with "invisible threads of gravity and time" and "frozen breath." These abstractions dull the imagery. Momentum is maintained, but the line-level craft lacks freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, cluttered with abstract similes and metaphors that obscure the action ("breath curling... like a question unanswered," "vibrations threading... like invisible roots"). This density of figurative language ("living equation," "world’s veins") creates a barrier to immersion, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over clarity and physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished with moments of lyrical strength, but suffers from occasional heavy-handed metaphors ("Unstrap your doubts"). The pacing is steady, though the final paragraph's summary of the lesson learned drags the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("ribs of a dead whale," "liquid gold") and filter verbs ("Elias turned to see," "he noticed"). The phrase "meteor hush" reads as a forced prompt inclusion that disrupts the rhythm of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level craft is competent, but prompt-forced phrasing ("quietly enthusiastic," "stellar doubt") creates jarring, artificial moments. These artifacts disrupt the rhythm and read as inserted checklists rather than organic descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.8)
    Line-level craft suffers from repetitive phrasing ("frayed like the frayed edges") and a high density of clichés ("shards of glass," "weight of centuries"). Frequent filter verbs ("Elias traced," "Elias reached out") distance the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    While the prose is polished, there is a high density of "like a" similes ("like a frozen river," "like spilled ink," "like a wound") that creates a repetitive syntactic cadence. This slight overwriting dampens the immediacy of the imagery in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.2)
    Line-level craft is marred by the ungrammatical usage of a required element ("precisely humane" used as an adverbial phrase) and repetitive phrasing ("drowned streets... drowned man"). The logic breaks regarding the paper artifacts also register here as a failure to visualize the scene's physical reality accurately.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.2)
    A significant cliché in the second sentence ("breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding") and adjective stacking severely undercut line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is weighed down by excessive figurative language ("churned like a slow-motion storm," "whispering secrets," "reading Braille"). This "purple" density obscures the action and leans on clichés ("trust had been the first casualty"), reducing line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is readable but marred by persistent clichés ("sharp as flint," "storm inside him," "silent scream"). These stock phrases reduce the density and impact of the imagery, preventing the "flawless" quality required for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.1)
    The phrase "storm-born silence" is repeated verbatim in the first and twelfth paragraphs, creating a distraction. Abstract phrasing ("innovation in its rawest form") replaces concrete imagery in key moments, weakening the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from purple phrasing ("macerated into silence") and clichés ("face a map of grief and hope," "raw and rusty"). These stylistic choices obscure the reality of the scene with ornamentation rather than revealing it through fresh, precise imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant deduction for simile churn and stock metaphors (e.g., "eyes that held entire galaxies," "skeletal trees clawing"). The prose is polished but leans into "purple" description that obscures clarity. The density of figurative language distracts from the action rather than illuminating it.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose relies frequently on clichés ("dying heart," "ink in water," "penny dropped," "clinging to the edge of a cliff") and adjective stacking ("beautiful, terrible, and utterly still"). These artifacts flatten the imagery and prevent the density required for the highest literary echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.5)
    The required attribute "serenely electric" is repeated verbatim in adjacent paragraphs, creating a clumsy prose artifact. The writing occasionally drifts into purple abstractions ("shard of hush," "forgotten dream") that reduce clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is marred by clichés ("knife through silk," "shimmering like heat off pavement") and repetitive sentence structures (Subject-Verb openings). The writing is polished in a basic sense but lacks the freshness and syntactic variety expected in a prestige market.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is mechanically sound and rhythmically smooth, but suffers from expository telling ("Rational enchantment was the only way...") that explains the magic instead of letting the imagery do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally strong with high density and vivid word choices ("pressure-forged alloys," "pitted with age"). The line-level craft supports the somber atmosphere well. A few moments of "scientific" logic (chain geometry acting as a lens template) are glossed over with smooth prose that almost hides the causality gap.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally polished but relies heavily on cliché similes ("coiled like a living thing," "flickering like a dying bulb") which dilute the freshness of the imagery. Density is adequate, but these artifacts drag the score.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.1)
    While rhythmically competent, the prose suffers from a high density of "verb + like + noun" similes (whale, eggshells, pythons, dream, water, blood, stars), creating a noticeable template cadence. This repetitive scaffolding dulls the impact of the imagery and prevents the prose from reaching the highest tier of density and variation.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from the logic clash of "ink" behaving like liquid on a screen described as having "pixels." While the imagery is pretty, this lack of technical specificity creates a distraction. The dialogue tags and interiority flow well, though the climax relies on platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is polished and readable but leans on familiar descriptors ("flock of birds," "storm of sound") and explicit tell-phrasing ("She realized she was no longer just listening"). The rhythm is competent, though the "quietly articulate" insertion at the end feels mechanically placed.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.0)
    While atmospheric, the prose suffers from abstract similes ("like a promise," "tasted like frostbitten hope") that blur rather than sharpen imagery. These "purple" touches reduce the immediacy of the physical transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from cliché ("fingers dancing," "forgotten dream") and awkward phrasing, particularly the forced insertion of "resonantly soft." Several sentences function as scaffolding that explains the plot to the reader ("She didn’t need to... She was free") rather than trusting the imagery to convey the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose has a strong rhythm but suffers from passive "to be" constructions ("was just another artifact," "became a liminal space") and some cliché imagery ("cutting... like a knife"). The high density of adjectives and explicit thematic scaffolding slows the momentum. The final image of the bottle is strong, but the path there is slightly overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level craft is competent, with smooth rhythm and clear syntax, but suffers from "purple" tendencies and cliché (e.g., "groaned under the weight of time," "shroud"). The reliance on abstract descriptors over concrete, specific nouns reduces the tactile impact of the scene. There are no major technical errors, but the prose lacks freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from "tell" density ("He knew analog memories") that slows momentum. Adjective-heavy descriptions and familiar similes ("like static to wool") reduce the impact of the stronger imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is heavily overwritten with a high density of similes ("like mist," "like salt spray," "like liquid amber," "like a heartbeat," "like twin mirrors") within a short space. This reliance on figurative language creates a dense, ornamental texture that slows momentum and obscures direct action.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished and readable but relies heavily on similes and phrases that approach cliché ("coiled like smoke," "pooling like mercury," "worn smooth by time"). These familiar constructions dilute the imagery, and the density of telling vs. showing reduces the immediacy of the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative and dense, with strong imagery like the "closing iris" and "skeletal frame." However, the piece relies on some stock phrasings ("fragments slotted into place," "memories surged forward," "realized with a jolt") that flatten the otherwise vivid texture of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong image density ("stretching and shrinking with the sun’s slow retreat"). Some metaphors verge on purple ("spines split like dry lips whispering secrets"), and the verbatim insertion of the prompt's tone descriptor at the end feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is functional and rhythmic but relies heavily on clichés ("like wind chimes," "no larger than a tear," "colors that had no name"). Personification is overused ("waterfall whispered secrets," "mist kissed"), creating a density of purple prose that obscures concrete action. These artifacts dampen the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a high density of standard similes ("like trapped fireflies," "like insects in amber," "like smoke"). While atmospheric, the reliance on "like/as" constructions slightly dilutes the immediacy of the imagery in a short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally competent but marred by clichés and abstract-concrete zeugmas that weaken specificity (e.g., "slick with moss and memory," "swallowed by the mist," "swallow sound"). These stock phrases reduce the literary freshness required for the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally polished with good rhythmic control, but conceptual slips mar the line-level quality. The image of writing on a dive slate where words "float away" is physically confusing (slates use wax or solid pencil), reinforcing the sense that the imagery prioritizes aesthetics over logic.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but relies on familiar similes ("like a living thing," "like a candle flame") that reduce freshness. The phrase "driftingly alert" is an awkward adverbial construction that stalls the image. While information density is adequate, the reliance on clichés in descriptions prevents the line-level craft from reaching higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished and readable but relies on several clichés ("slipped like a whisper," "eyes flickered," "unreadable expression") and pathetic fallacy ("pages... breathing"). These artifacts flatten the otherwise competent imagery of the ice and light.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is functional but marred by stock imagery ("skeletal remains," "ship at sea," "bones settling") and abstract phrasing ("clouds of unspoken apologies"). The density of clichés in the descriptive passages flattens the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but marred by cliché and repetitive imagery; "leaves in a storm" (paragraph 2) and "hush before a storm" (paragraph 5) appear in close proximity. Stock phrasing like "chest tighten" and "pulse steady" flattens the emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is burdened by multiple clichés within a short space ("creaked like an old man’s joints," "familiar to him as his own reflection," "prickle down his spine"). While the sentence structure is functional, the reliance on stock imagery flattens the imagery. The line-level craft lacks the freshness required for a high-quality literary market.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("lost to the ages," "painted the sky," "hues of silver") and filter verbs ("Elias realized," "He saw") that dull the immediacy of the scene. The description of the gears and mirrors relies on stock imagery rather than fresh, idiosyncratic observation.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is polished but reliant on clichés ("flickered like a candle in the wind," "riot of color") and emotive telling ("whispered of forgotten rest") rather than specific, concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.9)
    Competent rhythm, but marred by distinct clichés ("fingers trembling not from the cold," "glass shivered," "weight of what he was about to do"). Adjective-noun pairings like "bruised awe" feel overwrought and reduce precision.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the prose has momentum, it relies on several distracting clichés ("guilt sat in her chest like a stone," "voice rough as bark"). The opening sentence contains an accidental internal rhyme ("edge... ledge") that disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés and mixed metaphors ("stretched like a scar," "walls instead of bridges," "pieces fell into place like a puzzle"). These artifacts dull the imagery and reduce the impact of the pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally evocative, with strong images like the "compressed sigh" coin. However, some phrasings lean on cliché ("question without an answer," "older than words"), and the required phrase "mindfully scattered" creates a slight semantic stumble in an otherwise smooth sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.8)
    Line-level craft is damaged by forced prompt insertions (e.g., "voice sturdy brittle" lacks punctuation) and tell-heavy shortcuts like "emotionally contagious." These artifacts break immersion and rhythm, signaling a checklist approach rather than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is weighed down by sentimental clichés ("stars blinked awake," "heartbeat") and abstract labeling. The physical logic break regarding the clock weight creates a distraction that undermines line-level credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm is generally smooth, but the prose suffers from "adjective-noun" pairings that feel manufactured (e.g., "chaotically precise"). The repetition of the prompt phrase "helix-minded" acts as a scaffold artifact, and the final phrase "quaking reverie" feels pasted on rather than rhythmically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose efficiency is low, marked by tautologies like "clandestinely luminous glow of bioluminescent moss" (three words for light in one phrase). Over-modification and reliance on abstract nouns ("impossible pressed," "elusive truth") obscure the action and dilute narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is generally functional but dragged down by abstract telling and redundancy ("symphonically minded mind"). The reliance on filter verbs reduces immediacy, and the final paragraphs drift into essayistic summary rather than scene-based ending.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is mechanically clean but relies on familiar imagery ("bled into," "swirling like ink") that borders on cliché. There is a lack of density in the sentence craft; filter verbs ("Elias realized," "Elias watched") distance the reader from the immediate experience of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("wires snaking like veins"). Minor lapses into cliché ("heart pounding," "gave way with a whisper") occur, but the line-level craft is generally solid and maintains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is functional but marred by clunky word choices ("journalize," "olfactorily sensitive") and a high density of creative writing clichés ("whispering secrets to the wind," "drowsy cat"). These artifacts dull the imagery and prevent the line-level craft from achieving literary freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished and readable, with adequate rhythm. However, some descriptions lean toward standard "purple" phrasing ("breath curling into the stillness") and lack the density or freshness required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.5)
    A severe template cadence artifact disrupts the prose: the "Not X, but Y" sentence structure appears six times ("Not just reacting," "Not a survivor," "Not from the metal," "Not literally," "Not just for his own safety," "not a crash"). This repetitive syntax creates a mechanical rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose has a clear rhythm and mostly solid mechanics, though it occasionally dips into purple phrasing ("breath of the wind"). Prompt phrases like "sculpted hush" are repeated mechanically rather than woven invisibly into the description.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally competent but marred by occasional overwriting (e.g., the awkward adverb-adjective cluster "avalanchingly quiet stillness") and standard similes ("bent like reeds in the wind") that miss the chance for fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and atmospheric but leans toward overwriting with a high density of similes and metaphors ("gaps like missing teeth," "barnacles," "ship in a storm"). Some phrasing feels slightly abstract or precious ("velocity of joy," "geometry of grief"). However, the line-level rhythm is strong, and the imagery generally supports the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.5)
    While readable, the prose relies heavily on clichés (e.g., "marrow of her bones," "pulse quickened," "silence pressed harder") that dull the impact. These artifacts, combined with some repetitive phrasing regarding the "auroras," lower the craft score.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level craft is competent but marred by "prompt-itis"—awkward phrasing forced to accommodate required elements (e.g., "truthful lies of nature," "a shifted hush"). Imagery is heavy on adjectives ("spectral shards," "dendritic veins") where stronger verbs would improve momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.8)
    Several phrases rely on clichés ("unraveling tapestry," "thick as wool") or awkward modifiers ("stoically sparkling"). The prose density is adequate, but the line-level craft struggles to integrate the required phrasing naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is functional but tends toward overwriting ("quiet promise," "azure defiance") and passive descriptions. Several prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly ("between understanding and confusion"), disrupting the narrative flow and signaling the artificiality of the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm, particularly in descriptions like "something between a sigh and a scrape." However, the insertion of the required phrase "cyclically spontaneous" feels syntactically awkward and slightly disrupts the flow. Line-level mechanics are otherwise solid with no distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is functional and rhythmic, but relies on familiar similes ("like a sentinel," "like fireflies"). The integration of the required phrase "luminescent ache" feels slightly repetitive when used twice in a short space.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished but dense with modifiers ("blade of bottled lightning") and mixed metaphors (lighthouse as ship, loom, and architect). The technical term "total internal reflection" clashes slightly with the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished and readable but relies on familiar similes ("sharp as flint," "faded like ink") that lower the freshness. The rhythm is gentle but lacks propulsive density, and the imagery in the final paragraph feels slightly overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished but relies on familiar literary similes ("snapped like brittle twigs," "pooling like mercury," "roots unfurling"). A repetitive sentence cadence ("He [verb]...") appears frequently in the second half, creating a slight mechanical rhythm that drags the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is polished but heavily laden with clichés ("shimmered like liquid gold," "voice like wind through dry leaves," "heart ached"). Adjective stacking ("pale and fragile but undeniable") and predictable imagery reduce the text's impact, creating a smooth but frictionless reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by "purple" descriptors and awkward phrasing like "enlarged tranquility." There is a reliance on stock imagery ("wild with grief," "quiet ache") that dulls the line-level impact. The final paragraph flattens the narrative momentum into a summary statement.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés ("unspoken promise," "hollow shell," "ghost of something") that dilute the imagery. The "heuristically" modifier is a jarring artifact that breaks the rhythm and register of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is weakened by awkward modifier stacks ("gently meticulous precision") and the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("quartz hush" twice, "illusions fading to memory" twice). The reliance on telling ("His motivation was simple") over showing reduces density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("pulse pounded," "sharpest blade," "coiling in her stomach"). The phrasing of the "false starts" ("The first false start... The second came...") creates a repetitive, scaffold-like cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is clear but marred by standard physical artifacts ("breath hitched," "pulse quickening," "curiosity gnawed") that feign intensity. Sentences often perform stage direction or backstory summary rather than advancing the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is functional, but mixed metaphors ("laughter... slithered... like smoke") weaken the imagery's logic. Artifacts like the "uncorking" phrase feel like prompt-stitching rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is marred by repetitive figurative language (two "sky the color of..." similes) and physical clichés ("fingers trembling," "breath hitched"). The writing tells more than it shows, particularly regarding the significance of the map.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("lattice of sapphire"). However, there is a tendency toward "purple" abstraction ("symphony of truth woven from silence and light") that obscures the concrete reality of the moment. The pacing is good, and there are no significant line-level loops.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, accelerating well during the climax. Occasional dips into purple phrasing ("lips of a sleeping god") and the repetition of the descriptor "strangely organic" slightly mar the otherwise clean execution.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is functional but marred by stock phrases ("tight-knit web," "eyes were red but clear"). The final image of "sandstorm calm" creates a coherence break, clashing with the "honey" light and quiet atmosphere established throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is polished but marred by frequent filter verbs ("She turned to see," "She realized," "She understood") that distance the reader. Some imagery leans on stock phrasing ("dying beast," "borrowed time").

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally evocative, particularly the descriptions of the salt and light. However, it is marred by a few stock phrases ("pulse quickened," "scattered stars") that detract from the otherwise distinct textural quality.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is marred by clichés ("world held its breath," "second skin," "dying fire") and awkward, prompt-forced phrasing ("terrestrially cosmic") that disrupts immersion. A reliance on filter verbs and abstract nouns creates a "telling" effect that prevents the imagery from landing with sensory impact.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from purple imagery ("alive with the whisper," "etching fleeting silver") and repetitive celestial metaphors. The phrase "patiently nimble" creates a jarring adjective-adverb cluster that disrupts the rhythm and clarity of the dialogue tag.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but relies on several clichés ("flickering like a candle in the wind," "hairs on his arms stand on end"). Metaphors are sometimes muddled; "absorbed sound like a thief" is confusing (thieves move silently, they do not typically "absorb" sound), indicating a need for tighter image control.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is burdened by a high density of clichés ("poisoned honey," "cracking ice," "history was written by the victors") and overwrought personification. These artifacts flatten the emotional impact and reduce the narrative to a collection of familiar tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.3)
    The opening sentence contains a jarring root echo ("serpentine... serpents"). Phrasing relies on adjectival telling ("richly perceptive senses") and technical jargon that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.2)
    A definitive grammatical error (tense shift) caused by the insertion of a prompt element mars the polish. The investigation section relies on summary telling ("fitting them together until the picture became clear") which lowers engagement. Sentence rhythm is functional but lacks the propulsion needed for the deductive leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.0)
    Several forced phrases ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity") disrupt line-level clarity and appear to be prompt insertions that clash with the established voice. The prose is generally functional but relies on adjectives over strong verbs to carry the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is weighed down by physiological clichés ("pulse quickened," "mind raced") and stock phrasings ("silencing the truth"). The writing tells the reader what is happening emotionally rather than evoking it through fresh imagery or syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("moths to a flame," "cracking like ice," "splitting the sky like a blade") that deaden the imagery. The reliance on stock similes and telling tags ("lyrically prophetic") prevents the development of a distinct, publishable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and stock poetic imagery ("stories tasted of salt and regret"). The density of adjectival description slows momentum without adding causal weight, creating a texture that feels decorative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought (e.g., "groaned under the weight of the fleeting golden sunset"). Dialogue tags like "spat" and "rasped" are melodramatic clichés that detract from the otherwise solid line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.8)
    Simile density is excessive and repetitive ("like a jagged crown," "like coin," "like a broken promise," "like the steady hands"), creating a scaffolded rhythm that drags momentum. Clichés such as "broken promise" and "calm before the storm" variants detract from the otherwise competent prose.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is cluttered with adverbs and clichés ("cutting through the gloom like a scalpel"). The integration of required phrases creates awkward syntactic structures (e.g., "moved with watchfully calm precision"), and "empirical observation" reads as an unnatural insertion into the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is weighed down by abstract similes ("like broken promises") and clunky modifier stacks ("aptly deliberate slowness"). These "purple" artifacts reduce clarity and immediacy, drawing attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    While there are moments of strong imagery, the prose suffers from cliché ("groaned like a dying beast") and forced phrasing. The integration of "throughout the evolution" creates a grammatical fracture that stops the reader, and "steadily curious defiance" results in adjectival clutter. These line-level artifacts mar the polish expected of a top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is functional but marred by significant cliché ("silence swallowed him whole," "labyrinth of server logs," "ghosts"). The prompt insertion "Lena was brightly attentive" is awkward and unmotivated by the immediate context, reading as a compliance patch rather than natural description.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose is cluttered with cliché similes ("like molasses," "like a shattered promise," "like water"). Required phrases are pasted in clumsily ("his intuition, calmly intuitive"), disrupting the sentence rhythm and logical flow.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is atmospheric and dense, but marred by occasional strained figurative language like "steam rise like a question," which feels more writerly than organic. The "weight of endings pressing on his ribs" is also slightly stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.6)
    Melodramatic phrasing ("ink bleeding into her skin like a confession") creates purple prose. The transition "By drawing parallels" acts as visible scaffolding, telling the reader what the character is doing rather than showing the thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is rhythmic and readable but suffers from significant cliché ("sharing secrets with the wind," "voice that wasn't a voice") that flattens the imagery. While there are no major technical errors, the reliance on familiar phrasings prevents the line-level craft from reaching a literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is heavily laden with clichés that flatten the imagery: "dew-kissed petals," "whisper secrets," "frozen in time," "gnarled with age," and "eyes weary but determined." These stock phrases prevent fresh visualization. The rhythm is smooth but lacks the propulsion or density required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.5)
    Physical blocking is repetitive; the protagonist picks up and places the crystal on the desk three separate times, creating a mechanical loop. Phrasing occasionally relies on stock descriptions ("shadows dance," "blurred, then sharpened") that dull the otherwise solid prose.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is competent but marred by cliché phrases ("marrow of his bones," "swallowed hard," "edges worn smooth") that dull the imagery. The writing tends to tell emotions through these stock physical reactions rather than fresh, specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is serviceable but marred by the clumsy insertion of required phrases ("changelessly constant," "sound of a leaf falling") that disrupt the rhythm. Additionally, the repetition of "luminous ache" and the oxymoronic "changelessly constant" feel like unpolished artifacts rather than deliberate stylistic choices.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose flows rhythmically but is marred by sentimental abstractions and purple phrasing ("pulsing stillness," "scent of hope," "halo"). These artifacts obscure the physical reality of the scene, replacing specific observation with emotional shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is readable but leans on clichés ("forgotten dream," "flickered at the edge of her vision") and abstract phrasing that distances the reader from the action. There is a tendency toward "purple" description that inflates the moment without adding density, such as the "humming with latent energy" trope.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong with vivid imagery ("stars trapped in enamel"), but relies on a few clichés ("heart pounding", "felt in her bones") and abstract phrasings ("cleft in certainty"). The repetition of "bone" ("bone-setting", "felt in her bones") in close proximity is a minor distraction.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.0)
    While mechanically sound, the prose suffers from a high density of stock similes ("like a sleeping dragon," "like drowned things," "like captured moonlight," "like a second skin") that creates a formulaic rhythm. The overuse of figurative comparisons distracts from the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery, though occasionally overwrought ("golden glow," "silent promise"). The repetition of "honeyed" (dialogue description and setting description) is noticeable but functional. The final simile ("unraveling like the thawing icicles") borders on pathetic fallacy.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but marred by cliché ("mist curled... like a living thing," "trembled—not from the cold," "thin as paper"). These stock phrases flatten the imagery and reduce the impact of the more original concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from simile overload, with nearly every noun modified by a "like a..." construction ("like a cathedral," "like a newborn’s fist," "like a living bracelet," "like a question," "like a held note"). This creates a scaffolded, repetitive rhythm that dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("breath curling in slow, deliberate plumes"). A few phrases lean toward the precious or cliché ("forgotten dream," "stitched by time itself"), but the density of image and action generally supports the tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is competent and rhythmic but prone to slightly purple phrasing ("winter's teeth," "swirling like fireflies"). There is a reliance on summary and exposition in the early paragraphs ("Elias believed," "He had spent months") that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("splinter of bone"), but the hyphenated adverb "boundary-lessly" is a significant stylistic stumbling block. Information density is good, though some scaffolding ("Liora knew the risks") remains.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished but suffers from a high density of similes ("ghost testing edges," "drowning dancers," "sliver of moon") that border on purple. The figurative language occasionally draws attention away from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from simile density ("like frayed thread," "like damp mist," "like wind," "like time slipping"). Specifically, "time slipping through fingers" is a tired cliché that weakens the climax. The reliance on "like [x]" constructions creates a repetitive syntactic rhythm that dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is mechanically clean but suffers from a density of abstract metaphors and "telling" summaries that explain the protagonist's realizations. The final paragraphs rely on scaffolding ("She had come to assess... but was leaving with...") that summarizes the plot rather than trusting the final image to carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is functional but marred by significant clichés ("clung to him like a second skin," "vanished into the mist," "soft as breath"). These artifacts, alongside adjective stacks like "excruciatingly gentle," flatten the texture and prevent the imagery from feeling fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.4)
    While rhythmically competent, the prose relies on several clichés ("flickering like dying stars," "peeling like old skin"). The phrase "thoughtfully clear" is an awkward modifier stack, and "air itself seemed to hum" is a standard fiction trope that dilutes the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is competent but marred by cliché similes in prominent positions ("groaning like a sleeping giant," "rolling... like a living thing"). The writing is polished but dense with modifiers, sometimes prioritizing "writerly" sound over clarity or freshness. Sentence rhythm is generally good, but the imagery lacks sharp originality.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is competent and rhythmic but marred by clichés ("swallow her whole," "flashing like fireflies") and metaphor stacks. Phrases like "geography of healing" read as abstract therapy-speak rather than fresh imagery rooted in the story's concrete reality.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is rhythmic and generally polished, but relies on stock phrasing and clichés ("liquid gold," "dying star," "broken, but true") that reduce the impact of the imagery. The phrase "Through the discovery" is integrated awkwardly, disrupting the sentence flow.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose relies on clichés ("sift through her fingers like time," "scars like medals") and mixed metaphors ("grafting... stitching... ashes"). The striving for poetic effect results in opacity and platitudes rather than precise imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose is overwritten, with a high density of metaphors ("mouths agape like silent witnesses," "pulse a metronome") that clutter the imagery rather than sharpening it. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("luminous skeptic," "sidereal patience") violates the show-don't-tell principle.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but prone to clichés ("teeth biting into his skin... remind him it was real," "pattern that approximated infinity"). While the rhythm is smooth, the reliance on abstract descriptors and familiar phrasing prevents the line-level craft from achieving a higher density or impact.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is dense with adjectival padding and repetitive imagery ("dying ember" / "embers," "living thing" / "living tapestry"). The prompt phrase "thundering calm" is inserted awkwardly twice ("thundering in its calm," "thundering calm"), creating a repetitive artifact. The reliance on stock similes ("like a shroud," "like a living thing") creates a lack of freshness at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally functional but marred by repetitive phrasing ("Slicing time into perfect, forgiving slices") and weak similes ("hissed like dying embers"). The explicit labeling of the protagonist's trait ("ethically diligent") reduces density and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is competent but marred by several clichés ("thin as spider silk," "lap like a cat at a saucer of milk") that reduce the impact of the imagery. The density is occasionally diluted by ornamental descriptors that do not advance the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is generally polished but marred by abstract phrasing ("interlocking ideas") and one jarringly forced modifier ("groundedly imaginative") that disrupts logical coherence. The rhythm is smooth, though it occasionally leans into decorative description over active propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.5)
    Simile density is excessive (six "like a..." constructions in a short text), creating a repetitive syntactic scaffold. Phrases like "slipping through his fingers like smoke" and "swallowed every tale whole" function as decorative clichés rather than precise description.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose suffers from "simile churn," relying on "like" or "as if" constructions in almost every descriptive beat (like a wound, like checking, like breaking glass, like a knife, like malice, like water, like dried blood, like the truth). This repetitive structure dilutes the imagery's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is competent and functionally dense, though marred by occasional clichés ("cracks in the world's logic," "starving man over a crust of bread"). Sentence rhythm is generally good, but the reliance on "telling" dampens impact.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is smooth and readable with good rhythm, though some descriptions skirt the edge of cliché ("posture expectantly resigned," "fingers brushing like leaves"). The text is efficient but lacks the density and freshness of high-band literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is functional but marred by register clashes, specifically the insertion of clinical jargon ("synaptic plasticity") into a lyrical fantasy context. Adjective-heavy description ("iridescent sheen," "liquid memory") slows momentum without adding necessary density.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is polished but marred by a high density of clichés ("skeletal sentinel," "smooth as honey but edged with steel," "eyes sharp enough to dissect"). These ready-made phrases flatten the imagery and reduce the emotional impact of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with high information density and strong imagery ("shard of hush"). The repetition of the prompt phrase "creeping normality" in the intro and outro feels slightly mechanical compared to the organic flow of the rest of the text, but the line-level craft is otherwise high.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and readable but occasionally overwritten ("unraveled her certainty like a frayed rope"). There is a reliance on filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") that distances the reader from the immediate experience of the horror unfolding in the garden.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is functional but marred by awkward modifiers ("balancedly daring") and abstract clichés ("regret, if regret had a smell"). These artifacts distract from the otherwise clear action of the climb and roll.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but marred by stock imagery ("thick as wool," "black as the space between stars") and clichéd constructions ("spit and stubbornness"). While rhythmically competent, the reliance on familiar descriptors limits the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is competent but suffers from mixed metaphors ("rosewater dread... thawing") and moments of purple description that prioritize sound over clarity. The phrase "rosewater dread" reads as a forced insertion that clashes with the established sensory logic of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    Polished but reliant on familiar phrasings ("gravity had been a suggestion," "hovering like a hummingbird") that dull the impact of otherwise strong imagery like the "gears... like vertebrae."

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose contains several forced phrasings that disrupt flow, notably the clumsy usage of "unbosomed" and the adjectival stack "photographically cursed Polaroid." Figurative language often feels decorative ("splintered like broken teeth") rather than precise. The writing tells the reader what to feel ("repulsive allure") instead of trusting the image to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, but high metaphor density occasionally clogs the momentum ("roots stretching like strings," "stars blinking like notes"). The phrase "The fractal generating had begun" reads as a clunky, abstract insertion that clashes with the established sensory lexicon. Otherwise, the line-level craft supports the dreamlike quality well.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm and imagery are generally strong, with highlights like "sunwashed dread." However, the text relies on a few clichés in pivotal moments ("darkness yawned," "driven by something she could not name") which dilute the information density. These scaffold phrases represent missed opportunities for more specific, embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished and flows well, with good sensory density and pacing. However, reliance on stock phrasing like "choked with ivy" and "crept... like grasping fingers" slightly detracts from the otherwise solid line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished with good momentum, though it relies on some stock phrasing ("sigh held too long," "curse and a gift"). The diagnostic character description slightly drags down the otherwise solid line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is generally functional but marred by awkward prompt-forcing, specifically the ungrammatical phrasing "moved tranquilly perceptive." This artifact disrupts the reading flow and pulls the reader out of the narrative at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is functional but reliant on stock similes ("like a fallen star," "like breaking ice," "ribbon of light") that dull the imagery's impact. While clear, the figurative language lacks the freshness and density required for the highest literary bands.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting ("hollows of her bones," "weight of too many forgotten dreams") and a severe template cadence artifact (the "didn't know/but knew" loop repeated in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 8). These mechanical repetitions obscure the narrative flow and reduce literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is overly dense with stock metaphors and personification ("yawned open like a forgotten mouth," "stars blinked awake," "woven from starlight") that reduce information density and clarity. Repetitive phrasing ("Elias didn’t answer" appears twice to signal weight) and abstract sensory details clutter the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose creates a strong mood but suffers from several cliché physical reactions in pivotal moments ("breath hitched," "vision blurred," "shadow fell"). There is a logic stumble with the watch description ("The second hand had snapped off... Now, it pointed eternally to... 3:17" implies the missing hand is pointing, or ambiguously refers to the watch face). Sentence rhythm is generally good, but these artifacts drag down the execution.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished but leans into mixed metaphors (a parapet "clinging like a scar"—scars don't cling) and purple phrasing ("salt of a thousand forgotten storms"). The phrase "furrowed hush" is a synesthetic clash that feels forced. Rhythm and sentence variety are otherwise solid.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by abstract phrasing ("backlash of regrets") and self-explanatory similes ("ripples fading as quickly as his old life"). The opening "merrily melancholic" is a jarring, adverb-heavy construction that disrupts the tone immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is readable but marred by clichés ("dying star," "blade forged") and mixed metaphors ("clean slate carved... like a page in a ledger"). Repetitive phrasing ("Elias didn’t answer" appears twice) and telling ("Now, he was supposed to care") reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though it occasionally leans on familiar phrasings ("tears cutting silver paths," "crackle of embers"). There is a slight over-reliance on filter verbs ("she understood," "she realized") at key moments of insight, where showing the realization through action would have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.5)
    Simile density creates significant drag ("like mercury," "like a confession," "like a bone," "like crushed violets," "like stones"). Several redundant phrases appear, notably "unspool the past like thread from a spool," which is a tautological loop that weakens the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and evocative imagery ("stitch its wounds—not with thread, but with memory"). Sentence variety is good, maintaining momentum through the ritual beats. Minor deductions for occasional cliché phrasing ("Shadow work, the old texts called it") that disrupts the otherwise fresh texture.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés ("looming like a sleeping giant," "flickering like a dying star," "painted the sky in shades of fire"). These stock images flatten the emotional impact. The writing often tells rather than shows, summarizing emotional states instead of dramatizing them.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished and readable but marred by clichés ("pulsed faintly like a dying heartbeat," "quiet drum in her throat"). Information density is moderate, but the reliance on familiar descriptors prevents the imagery from feeling fresh or arresting.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is weighed down by a high density of cliché similes ("like a half-remembered dream," "like living shadows," "like embers in a dying fire," "like iron to a lodestone"). These "stock metaphor strings" (a penalty pattern) flatten the imagery and reduce the literary distinctiveness of the text.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from simile overload, with "like" appearing frequently ("like a forgotten god," "like the spine," "like constellations"), creating a repetitive scaffold. Phrases like "furiously tranquil" and "storm-kissed wonder" read as forced poeticisms that reduce precision.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is polished but relies on clichés ("precision of a surgeon," "constellation of light") and standard fic-speak patterns. The opening follows a generic "Setting -> State -> But Today" template that lacks freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from worn similes ("echoed like a gunshot," "hands like cracked leather") and sentimental phrasing that dulls the impact of the imagery. There is a tendency to summarize emotional states ("softening a man who’d spent a decade breaking spirits") rather than creating them through fresh line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose has strong rhythm and momentum, but the reliance on stock similes ("moths to a flame," "dark as spilled ink") in key descriptive moments undercuts the otherwise vivid imagery. These artifacts prevent the line-level craft from reaching the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is functional and clear, but marred by a few reliance on clichés ("pulsed like slow heartbeats," "voice like wind through dry reeds") that dull the imagery. The spatial ambiguity regarding the seed transfer between Nani and Liora indicates a lack of line-level precision. However, the image of the sprout unfolding into "pages of delicate parchment" is a standout moment of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence-level craft is polished with good rhythm and clarity. The prose flows well, though it relies on some familiar lyrical tropes (mist curling, weight of years) that prevent the imagery from feeling startlingly fresh.

Metaphor vehicles stay coherent—time as fabric, shard as needle—without mixed logic. Only hairline slip: “texture of time” is nearly cliché, but immediate tactile follow-through rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense: “skeletal silence,” “drought-resistant life.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent (vault as monstrous mouth) and serve stakes. One mixed register slip—“conceptual repricing” level abstraction in “weight of hope”—keeps this south of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances image or stake. Metaphors stay coherent—ship ribs, overripe fruit, cracked ice—without crowding. One paraphrase loop: “He had come here while his cells still divide… Elias didn’t believe in luck” restates mortality. Otherwise density is high, rhythm varied, and the final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense but not purple; each image advances atmosphere or character. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Occasional stacked similes risk overwriting (“golden-hour portrait thief… curator of fleeting light”) yet remain within lyrical contract taught in opening. Final paragraph breathes, letting the image carry closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—three metaphors across 700 words—avoiding purple drift. Information density is high: each sentence advances atmosphere, memory, or action. One paraphrase loop (“the thawing heart of the world…”) is repeated twice; minor, does not touch closure, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every paragraph advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent within the shipwreck/library frame; no mixed vehicles. Only one scaffold loop—“the betrayal should have broken her, but instead it had sharpened her”—restates the same idea; a minor trim would polish the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and musical; figurative layering serves the accumulative design. A few adjacent metaphors (“storm had clawed,” “marbled hush,” “ambered hush”) risk overlap but do not muddle closure. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; punctuation and tense clean.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, high-density: every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is spare—shattered mirror, stitched mouth—each re-used to reweight meaning, avoiding decorative overload. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; “loop” recurs only as noun/verb with shifting context. One minor scaffold: “the question never faded” restates prior line, but it occurs mid-text and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Sentences vary from atmospheric openings to clipped confrontational beats. Filter verbs minimal; “breath misted,” “lens catching the light” show without over-telling. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and internally consistent—no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges marbles and seedling. Proofing is clean; no typos, tense drift, or pronoun ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, high-density; each sentence advances image or causality. Only minor loop: “she had seen it before... she had never dared” repeats syntactic stem without new pressure. Metaphors stay coherent (heat-haze nexus, pages of time). No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Final line lands with crystalline cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—action, image, and atmosphere in one stroke: “water rose just enough to breathe life into the silence.” No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (mirror, shattered light). One mixed vehicle—“lantern light bent into corridors”—is borderline but paid off by spatial shift. Clean copy, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with pressure: wind-howling fragments give way to longer encyclopedic cadence, then spare unveiling. Metaphors are coherent—“petals like shattered glass” mirrors the broken prophecy motif; no mixed vehicles. Tiny scaffold: “weight of prophecy / weight of truth” is a near-paraphrase but occurs low-stakes; closure image is untouched. High density, zero typos.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Metaphors (“knife through stale bread,” “lover’s touch”) are spare, purposeful, never stacked. Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; the final line’s monosyllabic hush earns its cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence variety is musical; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layer is dense but patterned (river=time, swan=folded meaning) and pays off in closure. One paraphrase loop: “she did not mind. / Silence, she had learned, was not the absence…” costs −0.2. Otherwise lean, with strong paragraph cut discipline. Clean grammar and tense.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lyrical yet lean; no loops or scaffold, strong verbs (“coax,” “cradle,” “hum”). Occasional elevated diction (“cautious exuberance”) fits the fairy-tale register. One mixed metaphor—“roots through soil” beside “lullaby”—minor, does not dull closure. Read-aloud rhythm propels without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—description seeds later payoff (“threads stiff” → “unraveling just enough”); occasional poetic compression (“the axis wasn’t displaced—it had always been pointing somewhere else”) propels without overwriting; zero loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean and propulsive: every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative layer is spare—“beam like a metronome” sets tone then cedes to concrete action; no mixed-metaphor clutter. Dialogue tags stay invisible; beats carry subtext (“You’re not supposed to be here”). Only micro-slip: “the specs unfurled like a flower” edges toward prettiness, but it’s brief and paid off by tactile heating scene, so closure image stays sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence, mirroring sonic layering. Figurative language is selective: “sleeping beast” for pedal, “poorly stitched shroud” for silence—each recurs in altered form. No synonym loops or filter stacks. Opening and closing lines bookend with sonic imagery, creating propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is rhythmically varied, information-dense; figurative layering (molten glass, mirrored horizon) stays coherent. Minor scaffold: “had”-heavy pluperfect blocks in memory paragraphs slow propulsion; no loops or mixed metaphors in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is selective (“world snapped like breaking glass”) and never muddies causality. One mixed register moment—“procedural generation, not of code, but of time”—leans meta, yet the phrase is brief and pattern-taught by prior surreal logic. Closure beat stays clear and unpolluted.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language clusters only in low-action beats where density is welcome. One scaffold trace: “the way rhythm could enthrall the soul when words failed” edges toward abstraction, but it is immediately grounded in the drum gift. Otherwise, verbs are strong, paragraphs trim, and the final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances atmosphere or character (“smelling of wet moss and distant thunder” does double duty). No loops, no mixed metaphors, no scaffold. One tiny hedge—“the precision felt heavier”—could be cut, but it occupies only three words. Read-aloud rhythm is controlled and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose shows rhythmic variety: short sensory spikes (“bergamot and smoke”) against longer reflective coils. No synonym churn or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors absent; “crystal shadows” and “liquid twilight” stay within optic/olfactory domain. Final paragraph breathes without slack—closure image sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is musical, mostly controlled; occasional modifier stacks (“waterlogged air,” “chronic hush”) flirt with excess but pattern is taught early. No loops, no scaffold, metaphors consistent. One mixed image—“ribs like ribs”—mild clang. High density, clean grammar, strong final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic; figurative layering is selective, never clogging the high-pressure beats. A single paraphrase loop (“the petal’s charge began to fade / its magic spent”) is the only scaffold trace and it misses the closure beat, so the 9+ gate stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, read-aloud smooth; sentences double-task (action + atmosphere). No mixed metaphors, loops, or scaffold. One paraphrase loop (“reason the symphony played on…”) but occurs early, low-pressure. High information density maintained; opening and closing lines anchor and recharge. Minor cliché cluster (“salt-tinged night air”) does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Mixed metaphors are controlled—“whispers of lost languages” beside “glass-like branches”—and stay within POV lexicon. One scaffold clause (“she had come here not for the fruit…”) efficiently compresses backstory. No artifact touches closure; final line breathes. Density high; each sentence layers image or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean and image-rich; occasional poetic overlap (“time bent like wet paper,” “interrupted cadence”) skirts repetition but never stalls momentum. Final beat avoids figurative clutter, letting the frozen sand carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, largely loop-free; occasional poetic overlap (“silence that followed ambiguous loss”) is tolerated under accumulative mode. Metaphors stay coherent (sunlight through stained glass). Final paragraph holds cadence without syntactic scaffold. One paraphrase loop (−0.2) keeps it below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with action—short bursts when the light dies, longer reflective cords for memory—while information multitasks (tape label carries both plot and ghost). One paraphrase loop (“frayed edges of his own frayed existence”) and a mild filter stack (“he’d found… he’d assumed… he’d spent”) keep it shy of 9-band polish but remain below artifact penalties that would dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No scaffold loops, mixed metaphors, or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is spare and accurate (“yielding like warm wax” is single, apt simile). Opening and closing lines book-end the storm arc with sonic economy.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with escalation: clipped openings during cliff descent, then liquid run-ons inside the amber cave. Every sentence advances image or stakes; no paraphrase loops. The single mixed metaphor—“rain carried memory…drowning in ghosts”—is purposeful and immediately tethered to tactile consequence. Line-level craft is clean, propulsive, and closure-adjacent.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and musical—veins of quartz “pulsing,” shadows “coiling”—with varied sentence rhythm that accelerates during the crack. No loops or scaffold; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative density is high but patterned, taught early, and paid off when the music warps. A single mixed vehicle—“light spilled out like blood”—is momentarily visual/liquid muddle yet occurs post-closure, so impact is cosmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, high-density; sentences double-duty (action + atmosphere). No loops or scaffold. Occasional poetic compression—“echoes of stories half-drowned”—but figurative load stays light under pressure. One mixed micro-image: “missing teeth” beside “gaped” is redundant; trim would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; every sentence advances place or pressure. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (mist like smoke, waking beast hinge) are controlled and non-contradictory. One near-purple phrase—“heartbeat of something vast”—survives because it’s brief and motivates descent. Final line whistle lands with sonic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, vivid, loop-free; only one scaffold pair (“wasn’t magic…was something deeper”) that restates without new pressure. Metaphors are spare and coherent (tapestry threads, unheard symphony), never clogging the high-pressure tile beat.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“light fractured into a thousand hues”) and never clutters the high-pressure beat. One mixed vehicle—“chorus of the damned” applied to solar winds—barely grazes coherence, not enough to dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, high-density; figurative language is selective and purposeful—no metaphor storms. Occasional template cadence (“He wasn’t supposed to be here—not really”) is voice-motivated and brief; no loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor edge (“ink spread in fractal patterns, branching into equations”) is forgivable at closure distance. Momentum stays brisk; paragraphs advance knowledge or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is textured yet efficient; metaphors (gold leaf/captured sunlight, bonsai/labyrinth) cohere without crowding. No synonym loops or template cadences; sentence openings vary. Occasional elevated diction (“refract time itself”) fits the stationer’s sensibility and is earned. One paraphrase ripple: “he had come…only to find that silence was its own kind of noise” restates prior insight, but it lands just before closure and doesn’t dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—cathedral, magpie, leaf—each serving mood without crowding. One mixed metaphor (“paper trembling like a leaf caught in a storm” beside “containers… jagged labyrinth of steel”) is minor. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge; no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean and image-driven; figurative language appears sparingly and only when it advances atmosphere (“like a forgotten thought”). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; sentences vary in length to control tempo around the cello beats. One mixed metaphor—“pages are closing” literalized—barely grazes clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative layer is restrained—one sustained carnival/river metaphor—avoiding peak-beat clutter. High information density: each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“blue light bleeding…slow-dying ember”) is selective and image-driven. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“slow creep of light…turning shadows into ghosts”) barely grazes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical, each sentence doing double duty: “mist curled…softening the clatter” sets both soundscape and metaphoric softness. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; the single extended metaphor of pulse/heartbeat/anchor chain is sustained without strain. Rhythm modulates naturally; paragraph lengths breathe. Only a faint cadence repetition (“the drone… the drone…”) keeps this from a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong information density—each sentence layers chill, object, and thought; occasional poetic overlap (“weight of silence,” “bloom on the windowpane”) flirts with overwriting but stays purposeful; no loops, clean grammar, prop tracking intact.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: each sentence advances atmosphere or ritual motion. Figurative layering is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Minor cadence repetition (“day X…”) is pattern-taught and pays off in the seventh-day crescendo. One paraphrase loop (“the town had been…”) costs a sliver.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, pressure, metaphor—without clogging tempo: “coral-encrusted edges slicing through the gloom.” No loops, no filter stacks. Figurative density peaks at climax yet remains legible. A single mixed vehicle (“liquid starlight”) is forgiven because the vial’s impossibility is established as inherited lore.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the silence so thick it could smother a scream” does double atmospheric and stakes work. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent—broken tooth, spilled wine, copperlight. Sentence variety supports rhythm; no template cadence. A single overwritten line—“weight that wasn’t quite air”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; figurative language is selective, never stacked in high-pressure beats. Information density is high—each sentence advances memory, object, or cost. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; “winter-cracked fields” is the only echo and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: each image advances atmosphere or stakes; no synonym churn or template cadence. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “ribs of a sleeping giant” is singular and sustained. One paraphrase loop (“the labyrinth…its walls…its secrets”) is minor. Final paragraph breathes naturally; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and stress; no scaffold loops. Figurative language is controlled—one metaphor per beat, no mixed vehicles. High information density: “library of the dead” collapses setting, stake, and metaphor in three words. No artifacts touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, image-dense, no scaffold loops; “liquid honey” metaphor is sustained without contradiction. Sentence rhythm modulates—calm descriptive clauses accelerate into staccato beats at reveal. No filter-verb stacks; active verbs drive momentum. One paraphrase loop: “golden light…golden glow” within 30 words, minor −0.2, not closure-touching. Otherwise clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences pull double duty (action + atmosphere) without clutter. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent—stars as shifting text, candle as witness. Opening and closing lines bracket the arc with autumn leaves and echoed shouts, creating cadence symmetry. A single participle opener slips into simultaneity (“Watching the stars, her breath caught”), but causality remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information density high: “roots twisted like the fingers of a drowning man” fuses scene, threat, theme in one stroke. Rhythm modulates—suspension in repeated sibilance, then curt breath at climax. No loops or scaffold; each image advances pressure. Metaphors remain coherent to water-and-stone logic through closing glow.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty—e.g., “She scratched at the smudged notes… coordinates, a time, a name” simultaneously reveals plot, character compulsion, and tactile action. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the grafting motif without mixed vehicles. One clause of overwritten mist imagery (“curling like ghostly fingers”) survives without muddling causality. Final line breathes, giving cadence shift appropriate to Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “light slanted through the mist like liquid gold” performs atmosphere and stakes in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image, character, or pressure. Mixed metaphors are absent; fog, light, and plaster stay physically coherent. A single filter verb cluster (“she wondered if the child…”) is minor and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet sonorous: varied sentence openings, strong verbs (“shivered,” “flaring”), no scaffold loops. One mixed metaphor stretch—“bell flaring like a flower in fast motion”—slightly blurs metal botany but occurs pre-peak and doesn’t dull the final image. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates cleanly into the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “living metronome,” “candidly cryptic,” each phrase doing double duty for sound and sense. No filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops; sentences vary in length to mirror cicada hum versus human pause. One mixed image—“symbols shifted as if alive”—is minor but doesn’t cloud causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is lush but disciplined: every figurative phrase advances atmosphere or stakes; no mixed metaphors or synonym loops. The single paraphrase risk—“the way pain and beauty could share the same stem”—is immediately grounded by the act of writing, avoiding scaffold. Opening and closing lines are sharp, the latter releasing sound into darkness with cinematic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and stress to mimic breath: long fluid lines for tending, staccato bursts for the bamboo note. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat, never stacked—and each vehicle obeys internal physics (light refracts, fossils petrify). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; information is multiplexed (a single sentence slips world rule, emotional state, and sensory cue). Copy is clean; pronouns never drift; the final line ends on the monosyllabic punch of “live again,” letting the orchid’s hum finish the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “unsnared the first tangled thread of syntax” does triple duty—tactile, intellectual, sonic. One mixed metaphor (“ink…rippling like water” inside glass) and a paraphrase loop on “silence” slightly dull the peak beat, preventing full 9.0, but rhythm and information density remain exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“silver river,” “dried tears”—never muddles causality. Information density high: chain unspooling also signals prior presence. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; closing line “They were dancing” lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “dust motes swirled faster, as if stirred by an unseen breath” performs double duty—setting shift and omen. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay physical and coherent. One scaffold paraphrase—“Some things survived. Some things found their way home”—could be cut, but it lands as deliberate anaphora that charges closure. Otherwise, clauses are varied, nouns specific, and momentum clean to final line.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; only one paraphrase loop (“the wood was warm…”) and one filter-verb cluster (“he saw her”) in the vision beat. Figurative language is selective and coherent—light metaphors never collide. High information density: each sensory detail also advances emotional stakes. No artifact touches the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; most sentences advance image or decision. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent (feather as “bridge,” city “exhale”). One mixed moment: “first fireflies of summer flickered outside…mirroring the bioluminescence below” compresses two similes into one beat, but clarity survives. Clean grammar, precise tense, strong verbs. Minor filter phrase (“he realized”) is forgivable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence variety and paragraph pacing breathe with scene. Figurative language disciplined—one metaphor per beat, no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “the glass was showing her something new” could compress to “the glass showed,” but does not dull closure. Zero loops, clean grammar, precise nouns. Within striking distance of 9 but final beat still leans abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold detected. Metaphors (“ribcage of salt-bleached wood”) are precise, not piled. One mixed moment: “stars seemed to hold their breath” borders cliché, but context rescues it. Final paragraph avoids explanatory swell, trusting image.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm surges and retreats like surf; sentence openings vary, avoiding template cadence. Metaphors are coherent: star-gaps as breathing cosmos, ink as sea-in-vessel. One paraphrase loop: “salt-laced breeze... lover’s whisper” revisits salt in next paragraph. No mixed metaphors in peak tattoo beat; clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lyrical yet information-dense: each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors (breath like mist, cathedral of glass) are coherent, not stacked; no synonym loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“spectral shards,” “noctilucent reckonings”) fits the glazier’s ocular precision; rhythm modulates without monotony, sustaining momentum to the resonant close.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors (“liquid mercury,” “water through cracked earth”) stay coherent because both feed the same cracked-box motif. One paraphrase loop: “the forest called…in a way nothing else could” could trim. Otherwise momentum carries uninterrupted to the final ink bleed.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty: “salt and time” compresses geology + history. No synonym loops or filter stacks. Metaphor coherence tight—“needle… stirred by an unseen wind” keeps physics intact. Final third free of artifacts; momentum breathes with scene pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm breathes with beats—long sensory sentences in discovery, staccato when shadow appears. Information density high: one sentence often layers setting, emotion, and backstory cue. Figurative control consistent; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “the walls… the walls…” anaphora could be trimmed, but it does not touch closure. Clean grammar, precise punctuation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyrically dense yet information-rich; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Metaphors (prism as thief, lullabies as code) stay coherent and internally consistent. Occasional adjectival stacking (“dying light and blossoming jasmine”) flirts with purple but serves the accumulative cadence. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase drift; final paragraph’s rhythmic crescendo propels closure without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean and rhythmic; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative layer is restrained—lightning-heartwood, reluctant lovers—each image tied to character stakes. Opening line anchors voice and mythic scale; final line resolves with communal image that recharges earlier motifs. One near-misstep: “the price of redemption was high, but so was the cost of walking away” is tautological; the echo is minor and doesn’t recur at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean yet textured—sentences vary, no scaffold loops. Figurative language (“song no living ear had ever heard”) is sparse, deliberate, and cleared before the final image. One mixed metaphor: “unraveling of the land’s veins” beside salt crust is forgiven under lyric license. Final line lands clean, no clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is rhythmically alive—sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with scene temperature. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent: glass, mirror, temple, prism all orbit the same optic metaphor without contradiction. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. One mixed vehicle: “thread unraveled like a curse lifting” compresses two domains but clears within the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “rusted ribs groaning,” “meteor hush,” each noun doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. No loops, no scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, never stacked; when the bird “beats,” the metaphor is single, earned. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence rises and falls with candle flicker, final line exhales.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, atmosphere, and character stance. No synonym churn or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent within the elemental field (stone, wing, wind). One paraphrase loop (“they are not lost… waiting for the wind to remember”) is purposeful reprise, not scaffold. Final paragraph earns its slow fade without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (action + metaphor) without scaffold. Only one paraphrase loop (“names now preserved… not let them stay forgotten”) mid-story; does not touch closure. Mixed metaphor check clean. High information density, zero typos. Final line crystallizes earlier river-of-sound image with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm modulates: opening sibilance gives way to hard consonants as storm nears. Figurative density is high but patterned—concrete/root, wax/oath—so the accumulative design justifies it. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds tactile or causal news. One mixed vehicle (“ribs of some great, slumbering beast”) slightly strains physical logic, yet it occurs mid-scene, not at closure, and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, artifact-free: no filter stacks, no synonym loops. Figurative layer is spare—one metaphor per beat, each paid off (“star caught in god’s breath” → star-mirror). Sentence variety propels: long inhalation of opening sentence, staccato mercenary shouts, final fragment of shard. Only a hairline slip: “empirically ironic” feels tagged on rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean: 738 words, no paraphrase loops, strong verbs (“knelt,” “clenched,” “pressing”). Figurative language is sparse—three metaphors, all tied to body or sound—so density never stalls momentum. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” notion feels academic for Elara’s diction, but it’s brief. Final paragraph repeats “now” three times; intentional cadence reads as ritual rather than monotony, so no artifact penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean and musical; no loops or scaffold. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“ribs of a dying bird”) and pays off in the dissolving mountain. One mixed moment—“warm and trembling, like a bird with a broken wing”—leans on stock image, yet does not blur causality.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “vaulted ceiling had long since surrendered” carries both history and botanic victory in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—vows “deciduous,” juice replacing blood—without purple overload. Final third is clean, allowing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid yet disciplined: no loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrase (“weight of nonlinear inheritance pressing against her ribs”) is earned by voice; momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “jagged with the spines of books,” “off-key note in an unheard symphony.” Figurative layering stops before clutter; each image advances mood or rule. One paraphrase loop—“library of unlearned lessons was real…library took her”—repeats noun without new pressure. Otherwise rhythm modulates, sentences vary, and no filter-verb stacks dull the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—fog, rust, petals—teaching early, paying off in final dissolving card. One strained metaphor (“names bloomed like flowers in the dark”) is forgiven for charging conceptual closure. Syntax varies; paragraph cuts tight. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns. High information density carries atmosphere without stall, meeting 9- threshold for line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every sentence either advances action or recharges atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “Fables of absence whispered about them” is abstract shorthand that could be replaced by a concrete archival example. Otherwise, clauses vary, verbs stay strong, and the final line lands with cadenced finality.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences advance image or causality. One scaffold loop: “she had to… she had to” in adjacent lines. Metaphors (soap-bubble sphere, needle of light) are precise and mixed only once. No filter-verb stacks; rhythm breathes with scene tempo. Minor paraphrase in “ice ceased its groaning” / “caves’ usual harmonics faded” costs 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences carry double duty (“its edges still sharp enough to draw blood if he wasn’t careful” reveals object danger and custodial caution). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. One mixed metaphor—“light fractured into a dozen tiny suns”—is minor. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases with forward motion. Minor elevated diction (“alkali crust,” “retro-cognitively”) fits the custodian’s bookish solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences do two jobs (“The shadow it cast was too long, stretching like a finger pointing toward the horizon”). Metaphors are coherent and storm-tethered. Occasional modifier stacks (“stormlit observatory perched above the clouds like a forgotten god’s watchtower”) flirt with purple but stay purposeful. No loops, no scaffold, clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught—“stone petals,” “shadow tide”—paid off at closure. Sentence variety supports momentum without drumbeat monotony. One minor filter verb cluster (“she felt,” “she understood”) is forgiven under interior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet sonically alive: “lacework of salt crystals,” “sky prickled with stars.” Metaphors stay coherent—grotto as beast skin, pool as veil—and serve the final vanishing. No loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles. One near-purple phrase (“texture of time”) is allowed because the story immediately dramatizes it through immersion and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative layer is selective—only three extended metaphors—each pays off (beast-ribs return as she descends). Zero paraphrase loops; every clause advances image or pressure. Copy is clean; no misplaced modifiers or simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lyrical but disciplined: selective metaphors (light as needle and thread) serve the beat, no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop—“silence had learned to comfort” repeated in closing lines—dings −0.2; otherwise rhythm breathes with the scene, information density stays high, and no filter-verb clusters stall immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is rhythmically alive, sentences vary, no scaffold loops. Figurative layering is dense—prismatic sheets, liquid stained glass—but pattern is taught early and sustained. One mixed metaphor: “water parting like old parchment” conflates liquid and paper. Information density is high; each sentence advances image or plot. No typos or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense and metaphor-rich yet purposeful; occasional stacked similes risk purple drift but never obscure causality or clutter the closure beat; no loops, scaffold, or register violations.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; mixed metaphors avoided. Occasional scaffold (“the bolt… the bolt…”) but never in the closure third. Figurative control strong—“glass peeled back like a living thing” is precise. One paraphrase loop (“pressure isn’t just force. It’s potential”) echoes Mara verbatim; trimming would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences carry dual duty (description + foreshadowing). One mixed metaphor—“golden shadows stretching like fingers…ripple like water”—but it resolves quickly and doesn’t recur. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; paragraph cuts are clean. Opening and closing lines frame the sonic motif effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic; figurative language is selective rather than stacked. One scaffold loop: “He had not spoken in years, not since the war ended and the world began to unravel at the seams” compresses two clauses into near-paraphrase, but the slip is early and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional softeners (“the thought made Elias’s chest tighten”) flirt with cliché but are isolated. Metaphors cohere; no mixed vehicles. Final paragraph achieves cadence lift without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, high-density; sentences advance multiple jobs (action + atmosphere + interior). No scaffold loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor cluster (“liquid fire,” “golden waters,” “puddles fracturing sky”) risks purple but is brief and functional. Opening and closing lines are sharp; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Minor: “the slow erasure of the neck itself” is vivid but edges toward epigram; still, it pays off thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence, propelling the breath-music metaphor. Figurative language is restrained to one striking image per beat, avoiding purple overload. Occasional adjective coupling (“quietly vivid”) is earned by thematic payoff; no loops or scaffold detected in closing third.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; each sentence advances pattern or atmosphere without scaffold. Figurative layering (“skeletal hand,” “constellation of tiny stars”) stays coherent under arbor logic. One mixed micro-metaphor—“hush where past meets prophecy”—slips toward abstraction but is forgiven as it is taught early and reprises at closure. No loops, no template cadence, no register drift; clarity remains intact even at the luminous climax.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, free of loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrase (“mocking the very concept”) is justified by Elias’s mechanical worldview. No mixed metaphors; temporal sequence is clean. One paraphrase hiccup—“the weight of his uncertainty—no, not uncertainty, something more”—is self-correcting rather than redundant, so minimal debit.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes: long sentence that follows her through tunnel, then staccato line “Then she saw the name.” No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Figurative language is selective—only one metaphor per high-pressure beat—so “skeletal fingers” and “bruised twilight” land without clutter. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (crouched, brushed, pressed). Copy clean; pronouns unambiguous after subject shift to Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary from percussive clauses to luminous runs; each paragraph advances image or decision. Occasional poetic overlay (“sky bled a hidden sunrise”) risks purple, but rhythm breathes with the gorge and never loops or stalls the climb to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “ghost of its numbness clinging to his nerves” delivers tactile metaphor without purple spillover. Sentence rhythm accelerates into the vial burn, then fractures into short declaratives as the grid stabilizes, aligning syntax with revelation. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, body, or concept. A single mixed metaphor—“balance tipped into irredeemable cruelty”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—three metaphors total, each anchored to marine or archival imagery. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Information density high: “She unfastened the clasp…pulsed faintly against the leather” does three jobs in eleven words. One minor scaffold: “time here didn’t flow so much as pool” is restated twice; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and clause, propelling the beat; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. One mixed metaphor (“darkness like a held breath” alongside “wound”) barely grazes the climax, so the high-band stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet lucid: “books bound in translucent covers that caught the light like prisms” does triple sensory job in one stroke. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, stakes, or atmosphere. Metaphors stay coherent—glass, frost, light, void—forming a closed set that culminates in the clear bottle at the bare roots. One clause (“the world was new”) flirts with platitude, but contextually it is the only possible shorthand after total erasure, so the line-level craft remains within 9-band tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with diverse syntactic shapes. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat, never stacked. Strong verbs (“slumped,” “rippling”) replace modifiers. One mixed metaphor catch: “sky writhing with visible threads of time” is borderline, but context teaches the temporal-storm rule early, so clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “brass walls etched with the scars of time” does double duty. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) appears only in low-pressure narrative summary, not in peak beats. One mixed metaphor—“covenant of rust…pact between decay and creation”—is forgivable at closure because the image is reweighted effectively. Overall, high control with minor sheen.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, stakes, or sensation. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; final line recharges “humming” from vial to world. One near-repeat of “something older” could have been cut, but clarity never blurs.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean and image-dense: “the waves gnawed at the cliffs” does double atmospheric and emotional work. Occasional poetic uplift—“time pretending to be still”—is earned by grandmother authority, not writerly flourish. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; turbine hum recurs with accruing weight. One clause (“spirited in the way of those who carve…”) flirts with abstraction but is anchored by immediate tactile action.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor cluster (“pull of the moon on the tides” beside “tug at her”) slightly blurs agency but does not touch closure beat. Figurative control elsewhere precise: “ghostly petals,” “amber pavilion glow.” High density without congestion; final line breathes.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences advance multiple jobs. One paraphrase loop—“the lagoon’s surface rippling without wind, as if something beneath had exhaled” followed immediately by “the water began to churn”—costs −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge. No scaffolding or filler stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; only one paraphrase loop (“the town was a skeleton… its buildings sagging”). Mixed metaphors are avoided; “lanterns burn steady as if fed by an invisible flame” risks slight abstraction but lands because the prior beats have literalized invisible fuel. No filter-verb stacks or scaffolding in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence adds texture or stakes. Only minor scaffold: “He adjusted… He recited… He pressed” triplet mid-story, but the pattern breaks before the climax. Mixed metaphors are avoided; smoke-curl and fruit-surrender remain coherent within the sound-archive motif. No loops or register drift in the closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense but controlled; figurative layering serves the lyric mode without clogging the climactic beat. One scaffold loop—“the texture of borrowed time” repeated in concept not image—slight drag. Strong verbs (“rippled,” “ruffled,” “slumped”) and varied sentence openings maintain propulsion; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean and propulsive: “She had favored listening over noise, and it had nearly cost her everything” compresses beat and consequence. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“cloud-serpents”) and paid off in storm-turn. One mixed metaphor possible—“rain lashing…like a thousand whips”—but does not muddle causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “the stillness here was not empty—it flourished” performs double duty. Metaphors stay coherent (glass as constellation, station as forgotten prayer). No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed moment—“weight of centuries” vs. “decades ago”—is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is restrained—only “sea of cracked earth,” “ghostly echo of wings”—and stays coherent. One mixed metaphor risk: “weight of unspoken words pressing against his ribs” is saved by the physical act of breath-catching. Opening and closing lines are sharp, book-ending the arc with environmental return.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences vary in length and avoid scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“time slipped like sand” beside “air thickened into honey”—momentarily blurs viscosity, and the phrase “texture of time passing” is repeated without re-inflection, but these are minor artifacts that never touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and stress; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent—each metaphor (metal sheet, stained-glass feather, woven dawns) returns to watery light motif. One mixed moment—“burnished hush that made her chest ache”—is permissible at closure where pressure crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences vary without algorithmic pattern. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is spare—only “pillars… like old friends”—and earns its place. Filter verbs appear only when justified by mortal detachment. High-band control with microscopic slips in diction elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse enough that when “skepticism like a second skin” arrives it carries weight. One mixed metaphor—“golden time, a paradox”—is forgiven because it’s interior to a stunned mind. Line density is high: every sentence advances stance, setting, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences show purposeful variation; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors are internally coherent (mirror-wound, seed-whispers) and do not stack during high-pressure beats. Density is high—each line advances image or stakes. Two minor scaffolding phrases—“something older, something like” and “not the soil—there was no soil left here”—could be trimmed without loss, preventing 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “rusted carcass,” “phonograph needle skipping grooves.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances map, memory, or choice. Metaphors stay coherent under pressure; wax/vein/corpse imagery builds a single lattice. One hairline slip—“perfume of the world before the fires” edges purple but is saved by POV’s nostalgic distortion.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layering serves the Accumulative lens. Occasional elevated phrasing (“temporally stretched into lazy ribbons”) risks purple but stays tied to POV perception. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; punctuation and tense clean. Final image concise, recharging prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances image, stakes, or character. Figurative language is selective—void sky, frost-starlight figure—and never clutters high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; punctuation and tense are clean. One near-repeat of “breath fog/fogged” is the only hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, stakes, or character; no scaffold or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent (echo as smoke, board as wound). One mixed vehicle—“world cracked open like an egg”—but it occurs early and doesn’t recur at closure. Rhythm breathes with beats; paragraph cuts are purposeful. No line-level artifacts touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but disciplined: “stone… humming with a language that made his teeth ache” does double sensory duty. Occasional poetic overlap—“thread pulling taut between his ribs” beside “knots in his memory”—slight over-cranking, yet never muddles causality or dulls the final image. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; rhythm breathes with escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; no template runs. Figurative layers (“celestial engine,” “woven hush”) are sparse, taught early, paid off in thunder’s stilling. High information density—each clause advances memory decoding or sensory pressure. One micro-loop: “the platinum labyrinth in his pocket” repeats thrice in final third; intentional motif but slightly percussive.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose carries varied cadence, high density; metaphors stay coherent (sound as blade, silence as whetstone). Occasional intensifier stacks (“raw and real,” “thick as the mist”) flirt with overwriting but never clog the closing beat. No paraphrase loops, clean punctuation. One filter-verb cluster near midpoint (“She felt something worse—alive”) is earned as culminative beat.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, image-dense, and propulsive; sentences carry dual duty—action plus metaphor—without scaffold. Occasional adjective pairing (“damp, metallic air”) borders on purple but stays within POV’s sensibility. No loops, no template cadence, no mixed metaphors. High-band gate met; minor luster keeps it just below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences carry dual duty—movement + atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; only two near-adjectives (“still water,” “still wet”) repeat with thematic purpose. Metaphors stay coherent: tide swallows youth / cave exhales earth. A single adverb “slowly” could be cut, but momentum never stalls. Closure line breathes with cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective—moth-spiral, petal-touch—never crowding a single beat. One paraphrase loop (“the way the world trembled… the way the rain’s rhythm stuttered”) is minor. Rhythm accelerates into the release, then exhales with the final line, matching the storm’s cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, imagistic, with high density: “patina bronze censer foot sat heavy… etched with symbols that fluctuated with the moon phases” carries object, material, and magic in one stroke. Occasional metaphor cluster (“geography of loss”, “skeletal against the starlit sky”) but spaced enough to retain clarity. No loops or scaffold detected; final line breathes with open cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “the orchard’s branches groaned like a living thing” does double duty—atmosphere and foreshadowing. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or pressure. Figurative vehicles stay coherent (storm, roots, chains) and never invade the final beat. One tiny filter cluster—“she realized”—is justified by the quiet epiphany cadence. Read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally; no mechanical patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every image does double duty (mist revives flower + signals memory breach). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One near-overwrite: “bruised sky” edges purple, but the bruise palette fits twilight and is isolated. High information density maintained; final line recharges “burning” from lighthouse’s literal flame to metaphorical vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences vary in length and opening. One scaffold loop: “their silent stories more reliable than the people who occasionally wandered in, then out again” restates the solitude beat. No mixed metaphors, no register drift. The final paragraph’s rhythmic lift supports the glimmer without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense but patterned—starlight, fireflies, cobalt—teaching the reader early and paying off in the final glow. One mixed metaphor (“cage of silk and shadow”) is minor. No scaffold sentences; every paragraph advances image, pressure, or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense but controlled: “molten copper… seeping into the cracks” does double duty for light and alchemical ingress. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or choice. One metaphor cluster near peak—“embers glowing like dying stars… world holding its breath”—skirts purple but stays legible under Accumulative lens. Final line lands with rhythmic snap after longer prior sentence, earning cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies from long, clause-stacked lines to staccato beats; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors per page, not every sentence—so density never stalls. One mixed metaphor risk: “mountain swallowed him whole” beside “mountain’s teeth” reads coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Clean copy, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; figurative language appears sparingly and never clusters in peak beats. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Opening and closing lines frame stakes and resonance cleanly. Minor filter verbs (“he thought of”) are voice-motivated and do not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The ink crystallized at the tip, hardening into jagged shards where it met the air” shows material change and emotional metaphor simultaneously. One paraphrase loop (“she dipped the quill…dipped again”) and one near-mixed metaphor (“world held its breath…gods inhaled”) slightly dull the peak; neither touches the closure beat. Otherwise density is high, scaffolding minimal. Figurative language is controlled, not stacked.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary from lyrical long arcs to the staccato ‘Then, nothing.’ without mechanical patterning. Figurative language is selective: three metaphors across 750 words, each paying off (radio, river, orchard). No synonym loops or scaffold; ‘bottle’/‘perfume’ are reused with changing states. One mixed moment—‘scent of bergamot and lightning’ is abstract physics—but it is saved by sensory immediacy in context. Closure line is clean, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense; metaphor chains (“dust motes as syllables,” “veins of light”) serve atmosphere without cluttering causality. Minor loop risk in repeated “hush” and “spiral” but the pattern is purposeful. No scaffold sentences or mixed metaphors obscure the final weave-image; clarity holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Varied sentence rhythm, high density (“iron girders groaning in the fjord quiet”), zero paraphrase loops; one mixed metaphor (“air folding in on itself”) is momentary; no scaffold; razor-edge repetition is purposeful, not churn.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene—short pulses during laser beat, longer clauses in reflective lulls. No scaffold loops; only one near-paraphrase (“quiet wildfire” repeated) but it serves as motif reprise. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Information density high—each sentence advances image or relation.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; only one paraphrase loop (“the house always winning, but only if you let it” echoed two beats later) momentarily dulls momentum. Figurative language is selective, never stacked, and the final sentence burns clean without metaphor clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “the silence in their apartment now” is both grief-catalogue and foreshadowing of Mara’s own impending quiet. Figurative language is spare—disc “thin as a whisper”—and never stacks into purple. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each paragraph advances pattern or stakes. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases the held breath without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances atmosphere or emotional pressure. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Strong verbs—“steep,” “trace,” “slipped”—carry weight without adverb clutter. One near-filter: “He felt Liora’s presence” could be cut to the whisper itself, but the line lands in the denouement, not under peak pressure, so clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long lyrical opener, clipped beats at hand-off, then a resonant single-sentence close. Figurative language is selective—moon rock as “shard of frozen starlight” appears once and recurs literally at exit. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. One paraphrase loop (“he didn’t care about curses… he cared about the way the rock hummed”) could compress, but it occurs early and does not touch the closure beat. Grammar, tense, and pronoun reference are clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or interiority. Mixed metaphors avoided—“strings of an untuned violin” stays within sonic frame. One paraphrase loop (“the notes were not heard but felt… resonated”) costs −0.2. No filter-verb stacks; final image is uncluttered. Tightening that loop would hit 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lines are clean, no paraphrase loops; figurative language clusters in low-action beats rather than under pressure, so coherence is preserved. Strong verbs (“warped,” “bled,” “forecloses”) and sensory specificity propel the read. Opening anchors stakes; final line delivers image payoff. Only minor Scaffold: abstract phrases like “chaos of her own mind” could be trimmed for even higher density.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; metaphors (moonlight as benediction, silence humming) recur with purpose. No loops, no mixed vehicles, no scaffold. A single paraphrase loop—“the way the…” x3—drops the score a hair beneath the 9-band ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevated phrasing (“volcanic tenderness”) risks register drift but remains anchored in the Scribe’s voice. No artifacts touch the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, high-density; figurative language (“liquid starlight,” “bones of the earth”) is selective and purposeful. No synonym loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“universe inhaling” beside “bones of the earth”—barely grazes clarity but occurs before the final beat, leaving closure intact.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevated phrases (“choir of the lost”) risk purple but remain patterned; no mixed metaphors. Final line breathes without overwriting, sustaining momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from short pulse (“Maris didn’t turn.”) to long, weaving clauses that mimic shutter spirals; no template cadence. Figurative layer is dense yet coherent—reflection, stitching, stars—each image pays into closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor: “spiralingly calm” is an awkward adverbial coinage; smoother phrasing would nudge 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and rhythmic; no loops or scaffold sentences appear. Figurative language is selective—prismatic shadows, chess-piece grief—each image anchored to Elias’s perception. The opening sentence is long but controlled, setting tone without purple drag. One mixed metaphor—“grief is a forest you plant”—survives because it is immediately re-grounded in the seed-by-seed action of the window code.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is taut: “she slipped the scrimshaw into the pocket of her apron, knowing it was meant for her” does three jobs in sixteen words. Figurative control holds—mirage, salt dissolution—until “temple walls began to dissolve like salt in water,” a mild echo of prior salt motif. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph breathes with sentence variation; momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; figurative language is selective (“blades slicing the sky like the hands of a clock”). No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Occasional near-abstractions (“cultivate lightness”) are earned by context. Clarity and momentum remain high through the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is textured but disciplined: strong verbs (“pulsed,” “fractured,” “yielded”) and selective adjectives avoid purple drift. One paraphrase loop—“the way the light… the way the cold…”—is purposeful echo, not artifact. Occasional stacked prepositional phrases slow tempo at deliberate calm beats. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb clutter; closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density: “overlapping strokes, each one a negotiation” does three jobs in six words. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“scales of a rising creature” is the only reach, and it pays off visually. Copy is flawless; paragraphing breathes with the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with the ritual: long sentences for circling, staccato when glass hums. Figurative language is restrained—one rainbow, one held breath—keeping immediacy. No loops or scaffold; pronouns track cleanly. The final clause “the texture of connection wasn’t something to be discovered” could lose the passive “to be” for punch, but artifact is hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: “dust motes swirled in the slanted light” does double sensory duty. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each origami reprise adds new information. Metaphors (curtains of intention, gears frozen mid-sigh) stay coherent and character-bound. Final sentence pair (“The origami figures would keep coming… And so would he”) lands with cadence-earned lift.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene temperature; paragraph cuts are lean. Figurative language is vivid but clusters in places (“oil on water,” “shattered glass,” “cracked orb”) creating minor texture debt; no mixed metaphors. Information density is high—each sentence at least doubles duty. A single paraphrase loop around “mapped / being mapped” costs −0.2; otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative layering (“atoms of nostalgia…swirling like a storm”) is purposeful and peaks at the dissolution beat without clutter. Minor scaffold: “She had come…She had spent…She had read” triplet in para 2; the anaphora feels planned but edges toward template cadence, keeping the score just below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    Varied sentence rhythm; high information density—each line advances image, motive, or stakes. Figurative language is selective, never clustering to fog causality. Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; the final overlay sentence lands clean and luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; figurative language is selective (mist “curled like smoke”) and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional adjective pairs (“quietly vivid”) flirt with excess but stay within POV lexicon. Clause variety and paragraph cuts propel momentum; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to clipped beats inside the tunnel; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“sand…like shattered glass” anchors the frosted motif. One mixed micro-image (“tower groaned…like a held breath”) is allowable at this intensity. Information density is high; every paragraph advances pattern or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean yet sonorous; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay coherent (celluloid hem, hibernating heart) and serve Mira’s tactile ontology. A single mixed image—“hushed thunder”—reads as intentional tonal oxymoron rather than slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm modulates well; sentences breathe with aurora flares. Figurative layering is dense but patterned, taught early, so it reads as voice rather than clutter. One paraphrase loop (“stories…written in the sky…in the aurora…in the path”) slightly dulls the crest.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences dual-task. One scaffold loop: “He had never dreamed… he had felt something” restates without new pressure. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final third is clean, allowing high-band finish.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” territory) but stays within philosopher’s contemplative register. Mixed metaphors avoided; gear dissolves cleanly into light. Final paragraph could lose one adjective without harm.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, with high information density: one sentence often handles atmosphere, metaphor, and interior shift. One paraphrase loop—“step forward, then another”—is minor. Figurative control holds; “water lapped…like a shoreline lullaby” is the only mixed metaphor but does not muddle closure. Rhythm modulates without algorithmic pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences multi-task (action + sensory filter + metaphor) without congestion. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent under cold-metal through-line. Occasional elevated diction—“seraphically,” “unpardonable”—justified by POV’s meditative remove. Only minor snag: “the fortress breathe around him” anthropomorphizes without prior pattern, a hairline clang in an otherwise controlled texture.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Metaphors are selective (“stone arches sagging like the shoulders of an old king”) and propel rather than stall; no loops, no mixed vehicles; occasional elevated diction stays within a scribe’s ear.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, with high information density; sentences rarely duplicate work. Occasional minor filter verbs (“she felt,” “she woke”) slightly dull two beats, but no loops or mixed metaphors obstruct the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence ingress; a few lyrical stacks (“dying light pooled… like spilled mercury”) border on density but stay tied to POV. One paraphrase loop on “hum” vs “vibration” in adjacent clauses; otherwise high information density and zero scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; steam coils, vines curl, embryo pulses—each verb is kinetic. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. One near-purple cluster (“water…dark and thick as blood, and the air smelled of lightning”) is earned by climax pressure and stays legible.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; information density high—each line advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor (“pearl of stillness”) is minor; no loops or scaffold, diction stays within Lena’s lexicon, final image crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “charcoal strokes that refused to capture the way her eyes had dimmed” advances portrait action while stating emotional shortfall. Figurative language is selective: lighthouse beam “like a blade,” air “thick with salt and old parchment,” no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each paragraph adds new sensory or causal layer. Final line (“the shape of the ache”) lands clean, unadorned, letting image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean: 697 words, no paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Figurative density is high but patterned early—“wind-carved,” “half-remembered dream,” “sharp as broken glass”—so it reads as taught texture, not clutter. One mixed metaphor risk: ink “pooled… then rose like smoke” is physically impossible yet justified by supernatural rule. Final third is clean; no artifact touches closure. High information density: each sentence advances scene, image, or character.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with beats; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“letter burned through fabric”). One near-scaffold: “snow pressed… muting the world outside into a dizzying quiet” could compress, but does not stall propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“tranquil blazes,” “engraved quiet”—and paid off at close. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor risk: “weave continuity through chaos” is abstract, but immediately grounded in soil action, so clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“void that swallowed noise” serves immediacy. Zero paraphrase loops; information density high. One clause-level scaffold: “not with his ears, but with his bones” is acceptable amplification.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences do double duty: “The nib had snapped…not from clumsiness, but from the force of writing the final word” advances plot, deepens character, and re-tools motive in one breath. Rhythm modulates from long reflective cadences to staccato final exchange, supporting momentum. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent. Iron-gall scent, molten wax, and wind gust provide tactile propulsion without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean: no paraphrase loops, no synonym churn; each sentence either advances image or tightens stakes. Figurative language is selective—amber as absorber, tattoos as ledger—so density never clots the climax. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for laboratory awe, staccato for needle burns. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight the mosquito image; no scaffolding intrudes on closure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative layering serves the accumulative design. One mixed metaphor—“spectral confetti” beside “broken promise”—but it does not touch the closure beat. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences do double duty: “She pressed it into the stepping stone’s empty space, where *Amira* had once been” advances action, reifies cost, and renames in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new tactile or emotional data. One mixed metaphor—“heart a quiet furnace of defiance”—is minor enough to keep clarity intact. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the kneeling labor.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean and image-dense: “the garden pulsed with deep violets and burnt oranges” does double sensory duty. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances color, season, or emotion. One near-purple phrase—“tasted like lightning on his tongue”—is earned by synesthetic premise. Minor filter verb cluster (“seemed to hold its breath”) but occurs pre-climax and doesn’t dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry double duty: “paint dried but pathways remained” advances plot and reweights metaphor in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each brushstroke adds new sensory or causal information. Figurative language is sparse under peak pressure, avoiding purple clutter. Minor filter verb cluster (“she could see”) during vision beat, but immediacy recovers with tactile follow-up.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is rhythmically alive: sentence length varies, metaphors stay precise, no scaffold loops. Minor overwrought line—“forgotten teeth” crumbling towers—survives because it’s brief and early. Information density high; each line advances atmosphere or stakes. Clean copy, no simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“captured sunset,” “breath held too long”—never clogging high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Opening and closing lines act as resonant bookends without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“valley stretched like a wound”—never overwrought. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Opening and final lines anchor voice and reweight motif. Copy is clean; no tense drift or pronoun ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is supple: fragments (“Then another, and another…”) mimic raindrop count; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevated phrasing—“conceptual repricing,” “palimpsest promise”—feels academic against Elias’s calloused POV, a minor register drift that nicks immediacy but never obscures causality or dulls the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean and sensorily rich; only minor loop risk in repeated “as if” constructions, but each image advances atmosphere or stakes. No mixed metaphors, and the final sentence (“The bowl he had made was filled with honey”) lands with crisp resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Occasional lyric uplift (“liquid silver”) is balanced by concrete verbs (“wiped,” “clutching”). One mixed moment—“the world shifted, just a little”—edges toward abstraction but does not mar the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “atomically reflective” does explanatory double-duty for both surface and theme. Metaphors are coherent—tidal shelves, heartbeat of the world—and never mixed. One paraphrase loop (“she had learned… she had spent”) is forgivable at 700 words. Final paragraph avoids syntactic monotony, letting the last line ring without ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is textured yet propulsive: “white petals unfurling under the weight of the recent cloud bursts” collapses time and weather in one stroke. Figurative density is high but patterned—spirals, mirrors, threads—teaching the reader early; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Occasional near-repetition (“whimsical and inevitable” twice) is the only minor loop; it doesn’t touch closure. Strong verbs (“reclaim,” “unspool,” “breathe”) and varied paragraph rhythm support momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary from long atmospheric coils to clipped beats, propelling the climax. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances choice or stakes. Figurative language is spare—“red lights blinking like distant stars”—and stays accurate to POV. Zero mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; high information density maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) with near-zero scaffold. One paraphrase loop—“the Nexus was never meant to be fixed. It was meant to move”—is purposeful repetition for emphasis, not artifact. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent (lattice, veins, ship). Final line lands with punchy monosyllables that recharge the opening starlight.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold or synonym loops. One mixed metaphor—“mist curling like smoke” beside “yawned beneath the mist”—is minor; otherwise verbs are sharp (“swallowing,” “frayed,” “slick”) and paragraphs are cut-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“station clung like a dying man” anchors stakes without overwriting. Information density high: one line often does setting + metaphor + emotional charge. Zero scaffolding, zero mixed metaphors. Clean grammar and tense throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with weather: clauses lengthen during mist, shorten when rain drums. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—every metaphor (rust-lace, pixel amnesty, applause-rain) re-enters closure, avoiding sprawl. One mixed vehicle: “pixelated amnesty” fuses tech and legal diction—acceptable within Lena’s conceptual lexicon. No loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, image-driven, no scaffold loops; sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative language is spare and purposeful (“metal bones groaning like a ship”). One paraphrase overlap (“Some paths circled back…”) repeats concept but not exact phrasing—minor. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly. Rain patter supplies natural cadence shift without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive—"the stars wheeling in their ancient dance"—with only minor filter-verb clusters; no mixed metaphors or loops, and paragraph cuts are purposeful; one scaffold phrase ("the dreams had been trying to tell him") could be trimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “the seed split... thin as a thread” delivers two jobs—image and stakes—in nine words. One paraphrase loop—“she had known / she had always known”—is purposeful echo, not scaffold. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors. Final line breathes, giving rhythmic closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense yet musical; mixed metaphors are controlled (“bruise deepening” beside “ink into parchment”) and serve mood. One scaffold loop: “the future had arrived early” appears twice with no additive pressure. Strong verbs dominate—“plucked,” “traced,” “tilted”—and sentences vary across paragraph breaks. No artifacts intrude on the closure beat; clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath of opener, staccato at hand-off. Figurative load is high but patterned—orchard as lung, card as petal—taught early and paid off in root-tremor. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. One mixed metaphor (“ledger of lives” beside “marrow of the dead”) barely grazes clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm: paragraph breaths match emotional dips/crescendos. Sentence variety avoids template cadence; no filter-verb clusters. Metaphors stay sonic-centric, coherent. Minor scaffold: “wind howled...wind howled” reprise is purposeful echo, not loop, so unpunished. Opening and closing lines frame stake and release cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative control is precise—“clouds shifted like a restless sea” is the only simile, earned. No scaffold, loops, or filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines bracket the arc with mirror pulses. Minor alliteration (“pulse…pocket…pressed”) reads intentional, not purple. Ready for print.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, atmosphere, micro-action—without scaffold; figurative control holds (“moon…bled silver”) and no mixed metaphors; one paraphrase loop (“the creel accepted that one, too”) is minor; clarity and propulsion remain pristine through the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—description seeds later payoff (pearl’s glow foreshadows dissolution). Figurative language is patterned early and paid off, avoiding density penalty. One minor loop: “confessions…confessions” in adjacent clauses; not enough to dull closure. Final line “quartz…like seeds” crystallizes the reconfiguration cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are dense and multi-tasking; one line can evoke sensory data, back-story punch, and metaphor (“ivy…like old fingers remembering a tune”). Mixed metaphors are few and minor; occasional Latinate loft (“methodical in her pursuit”) is noticeable but not muddled. No scaffold loops, no filter-verb stacks; paragraph cuts are clean. Closing image achieves textural specificity without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—image plus concept—without scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“time bends for those who listen”) is minor. Filter verbs are rare; when used (“she wondered”) they cue genuine uncertainty. No loops or register drift in peak beats; clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences vary in length, opening words diversify, no scaffold loops. Metaphors stay coherent—ice, fracture, stain—without mixed vehicles. One overwritten beat: “music of what could have been, if only the world had bent differently” leans purple, but it is the only slack line and does not touch closure. High information density; every sentence advances character, image, or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lyrical yet lean; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—each aurora color shift marks a narrative beat, so density earns its keep. Opening and closing lines are mirror-polished. One mixed vehicle (“fractured dreams” scattering from emerald) barely grazes clarity, preventing 9.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean yet lush: “jagged walls slick with condensation,” “pool of black water… so still it might have been glass.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One clause-stack (“its jagged walls slick with condensation that never quite became rain”) risks density but reads aloud cleanly. Final paragraph avoids sentimental uplift; rhythm cadences to match the hush theme.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—mixed metaphors avoided. Occasional elevated phrasing (“protected vulnerability,” “conceptual repricing”) skirts register edge but stays within scholar-adjacent POV tolerance. Clause propulsion remains intact; final sentence lands with cadenced exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense; most sentences dual-load image + interiority. Occasional soft filler—“cool, smooth surface” twice, “rings still spreading outward in perfect, silent circles” could trim one modifier. No mixed metaphors or loops; clarity intact. Final third clean, allowing 9+ eligibility elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative layering serves the accumulative lens. No template cadence or synonym loops; each metaphor extends the acoustic motif. The single strike of the skimmer in the final paragraph lands with monosyllabic force after longer sentences, creating rhythmic closure. A marginal purple tint (“weight of centuries settling into his bones like dust”) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    Most sentences carry dual duty—action plus temperature or metaphor—maintaining momentum. One scaffold pair: “his fingers numb, his magic too weak to warm him” appears in adjacent clauses; minor but audible. Metaphors (“sky… schools of fish”) cohere and do not stack during the climax. Read-aloud rhythm breathes correctly; no filter-verb clusters. A single typo-free, clean submission at copy level.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry triple duty—action, atmosphere, metaphor—without overcrowding. One mixed metaphor (“lanterns like liquid gold” beside “meteor hush”) but it clears before closure; no loops or scaffold, rhythm breathes with beats.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense but patterned: metaphor clusters serve the accumulative design and are paid off in the final note. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stance. One mixed metaphor—“embers of a dying star” beside “roaring fire”—slight blur, but it does not touch closure. Rhythm modulates cleanly from languid to crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from amber-tinged description to staccato naming beats, propelling the final beam. Figurative density is high but patterned—ink, light, glass, hymn—teaching the reader early and paying off in the crystallized beam. One scaffold loop—“I see you” tripled—reads intentional as incantation rather than redundancy. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb clusters obscure causality; the closing image remains crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; rhythm breathes with drip-counting tension. Figurative language selective—one metaphor per beat, no clutter. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; “cracks” and “silence” recur with evolving charge. Information dense: one line often does two jobs (action + atmosphere). Copy clean; pronoun reference clear. No artifacts in final third; closure image unobscured.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong information density: one sentence often advances atmosphere, stakes, and backstory. Two mixed metaphors—“bones of a forgotten song,” “drowned man gasping”—slightly muddle; no loops or template cadence detected. Final third remains artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry dual duty (action + image). One scaffold loop: “she had… she had…” repeats at 120-word mark but does not touch closure. Mixed metaphor check clean. No filter-verb stacks in peak beat. Density high without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (action + metaphor) without purple overload. One paraphrase loop: “the way the wind had torn… / the way he’d yanked” costs −0.2. Otherwise tight, clean, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“storm inside him” is cliché but isolated. No loops or synonym churn; each line advances pressure or image. Strong verbs (“blade sliced the illusion”) carry weight, minimal adverbs. Copy-clean punctuation and tense.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; each paragraph advances knowledge or stakes. No loops or synonym churn. Occasional poetic uplift (“storm-born silence”) stays purposeful and pattern-taught early. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“shattered,” “traced,” “plunging”) propel. Only minor scaffold: “she rushed outside to find” could compress, but clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean and musical; sentences vary in length to mimic crescendo/decrescendo. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“macerated into silence”). Opening and closing lines bookend with echo motif. One minor adverb (“mournfully eager”) is told, but it is later embodied, so the infraction is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean: every image advances mood or stakes; no filler adjectives. Metaphors stay coherent—garden as mind-wound, breath as question—and resolve in the blank-book payoff. One paraphrase loop—“waiting her whole life…didn’t feel the need to wait”—is earned thematic echo, not scaffold. Clause rhythm varies; opening and closing lines frame without overwriting. Clean copy, no artifact strain.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors in peak beats. One paraphrase loop on explosions (−0.2) but no scaffold clutter. Opening and closing lines anchor and reweight the stakes cleanly. High information density without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musically varied; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned—every metaphor (tower as forgotten dream, shard as mirror world) is reused and pays off in closure. One minor scaffold: “serenely electric” appears twice within four lines; compression would strengthen. Otherwise information density is high, propelling forward without hedges or boilerplate.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and texture; figurative language is controlled and purposeful. One scaffold pair (“He knew what that meant. The ferry was vanishing.”) and a few filter verbs keep it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong verbs (“thread clung,” “walls collapsed”) and high density; occasional figurative layering (“vein of liquid silver,” “breathing walls”) stays purposeful. One scaffold pair: “He didn’t panic. There was a strange calm…” could merge, but it doesn’t dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; sentences carry double duty—world facts plus emotional charge. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (anchor → path → star-chart). Minor overwrite: “sprawled across the ocean floor like a corpse of coral and steel” stacks two vehicles in opener, but pattern is taught and revisited, earning its keep. Closing sentence lands with punch and clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “the decades-old hearing aid crackling like static from another era” does triple duty. No synonym churn or template cadence. Metaphors (mist like living thing, smile fragile as mist) stay coherent. One paraphrase loop on photograph pocket; otherwise zero scaffold. Final line lands with imagistic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Varied sentence rhythm, high information density, no loops or scaffold; occasional stacked figuratives (“gold absorbed like blood into sand”) verge on surplus but occur after climax, leaving closure image intact.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (light refraction = ink pixels) so no density penalty. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Final line “The stars are still watching” is a perfect cadence punch. Only a single paraphrase loop (“he had come here… he had come here”) keeps it from 9.2.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong verbs (“harness,” “refracted,” “breathed”) and varied sentence rhythm propel forward; occasional adjective drift (“eerie light,” “quietly articulate”) slightly dilutes peak beat but does not loop or obscure causality. No scaffold sentences; metaphors stay internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is selective, never crowding a single beat. No loops or mixed metaphors. One scaffold—“the way the air bends here” repeated near midpoint—dulls momentum slightly; trim would clear 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid monotony. Information density high: one sentence often advances music, stakes, and body. No mixed metaphors; “shattered prism” stays consistent with light motif. Zero loops or scaffold; no artifact in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean and double-duty: “ink bleeding into the paper like a bruise” advances both setting and theme. No synonym loops or scaffold; figurative density drops at climax to let the final image breathe. One mixed metaphor—“border town… stretch of pavement where two nations had once carved their names”—barely grazes clarity. Otherwise clean, vivid, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences do double duty: “The halo fragment glowed faintly in his grip, its light pulsing in time with his voice” advances plot, image, and causality in one breath. Figurative load is high but patterned (bells = time, halo = heart), taught early and paid off. One scaffold loop: “the wind bells chimed again” appears three times with near identical phrasing—minor drag. Otherwise rhythm modulates, no mixed metaphors, and the final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: each metaphor extends the bibliophile sensorium without crowding beats. One mixed vehicle—“angles bent like reeds in wind” beside hyperbolic math—barely grazes clarity. No loops or scaffold; final sentence lands clean, recharging scarf warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with dawn sequences; occasional adjective drift (“salt-tinged air,” “liquid amber”) is controlled and never muddles the final image; no loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; each sentence advances ritual or stakes. Figurative language is selective—starlight pools like mercury—never stacked. No loops, scaffold, or register drift appear; the final braid shimmer is earned by earlier tactile handling, so the image lands without metaphoric muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“constellation breadcrumb trail”—but it clears before climax. Final image is uncluttered, high-density. Within 9+ band except for single figurative slip.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; metaphors are consistent (glass, shadow, lips) and reinforce theme. Occasional minor scaffold—“she had been exiled here—not by decree, but by choice, a reversible exile…”—explains what the prior clause already shows, but the loop is brief. No mixed vehicles or density clutter in the final beat; rhythm breathes with the swing’s creak, carrying the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; “silver thread woven through the hush” is singular and sustained. One scaffold pattern—“seed was not just a bridge, but a vessel”—is allowed because it serves as conceptual pivot. Information density is high; most sentences do two jobs (image + causality). The only overwrite risk is the triple adjective swirl (“gold and crimson” repeated) but it culminates in the final bud, so the repetition is purposeful cadence rather than decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—light as fireflies, voices as smoke—never stacked in high-pressure beats. Strong verbs (“clamped,” “drove,” “writhed”) carry motion. One minor scaffold: “He had heard…he could not ignore them” could compress, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but never purple; each image (pigment scent, iron groan) advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; varied sentence openings maintain momentum. One mixed metaphor—“darkness swallowed sound”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean and double-duty: “his fins stirring silt like ash from a forgotten fire” advances both action and mood. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new tactile or conceptual data. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles (thread, loom, transmission) belong to Liora’s intellectual palette and stay consistent. One tiny filter cluster—“He understood then”—could be trimmed, but it does not mar the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean: every clause adds sensory or causal value. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—sound-as-light, mist-as-listener—so density reads intentional, not purple. One scaffold loop: “the mist coiled tighter, as if listening” echoes earlier “mist curled…like a living thing,” a hairline slip that does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, propulsive; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“diary shifting as if breathing”—and never clutters the high-stakes beat.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors stay aerodynamic—no mixed vehicles, no purple stacks. Rhythm modulates from lullaby cadence of sway to clipped final beat. One micro-loop: “brass telescope” repeated four times in close proximity; however, the object is focal, so the incantatory effect reads as obsession rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: every sentence advances image or stake; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative layer (“lock so intricate it seemed to breathe”) is sparse, purposeful, and paid off by the living sky sketch. Rhythm modulates—long accumulation, then clipped refusal—mirroring the escalatory hush. One micro-slip: “thousand shades of blue” edges toward cliché, but context reframes it through fractal precision.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative layer is restrained—one sustained starling metaphor—so density never clogs the discovery beat. Information dual-loads action + atmosphere (“brass-plated hull glowing faintly under the last embers”). Final line lands on image, not explanation. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative layer is selective—mirrors “windows into possibilities,” oil “captured sunlight”—and drops away during high-pressure gear placement to keep causality clear. Zero paraphrase loops; each paragraph advances placement or knowledge. Minor scaffold: “gears began to turn / Not all at once, but slowly” could compress to one clause, but the pause mirrors mechanical lag and thus earns its breath.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative layering (“nebula... whispered of forgotten rest”) is sparse and patterned, taught early. Rhythm accelerates across the seven-dawn structure, each paragraph opening with temporal anchor. Only minor filter verb (“they discovered”) mid-story; no artifacts near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, rhythm mirrors emotional cadence, zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“ripple… smooth as glass”—never clogs the climax. High information density: each line advances image, stakes, or sensory cue. Copy-clean; no tense or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The mechanical birds patrolled… their brass wings glinting” advances stakes and paints dusk. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph cuts cleanly. Metaphors stay coherent (beggar’s grip, stone of guilt) and serve emotional pressure. Only minor filter verb (“She realized”) could be excised, but it occurs in a low-pressure beat and doesn’t dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is fluid, rhythmic, largely free of scaffold or metaphor clutter. Mixed metaphors (“braided ravine stretched like a scar… whispering of ancient fractures”) are vivid and coherent. No paraphrase loops; information density high. One filter-verb cluster (“she thought… she remembered… she had treated”) mid-story slightly dulls immediacy but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene temperature; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—one crystalline branch, one prismatic dust—never clustering into purple. Sentences carry double duty: “He had incised his own name into the wood earlier, not out of pride, but to prove he existed—though the letters had already begun to fade” advances character, theme, and stakes in one sweep. Zero scaffolding; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. One tiny register drift: “conceptual repricing” vibe in “reweights the premise” leaks in via thematic echo, but it’s a single clause and doesn’t dull the final image. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the emotional swell.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose breathes with scene needs—short beats for ascent, longer cadence for communal release. Mixed metaphors avoided; “missing syllable in a hymn” is precise. One paraphrase loop (“voices could rise together, not just in song, but in understanding”) could compress. No scaffold, no purple. Opening and closing lines anchor and echo effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and lyrical yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and concept. One paraphrase loop (“weight of forgotten things” echoed in “weight of it familiar”) mildly dulls. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Clean grammar and precise punctuation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm modulates from elongated sensory clauses to staccato beats (“She opened the book.”). Information density high: one sentence often does two jobs. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor overwriting: “clandestinely luminous” appears twice in 700 words; second use dulls the coinage. Still, propulsion never stalls and the final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence either advances tactile discovery or deepens acoustic metaphor. No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. The single intensifier cluster (“raw, uneven, the voice of something broken”) is justified by the emotional peak and is immediately grounded in action—therefore allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, with high information density; most sentences do two jobs. No loops or scaffold clusters. Metaphors stay coherent and scene-anchored. Occasional elevated phrasing (“eclipsed covenant,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register above the POV’s plausible lexicon, keeping the score sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; figurative language appears sparingly and only when it advances texture (“air itself seemed to shimmer”). No synonym loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image, stakes, or atmosphere. The single adverb “almost reverent” is justified by Elias’s stunned vantage. Clause variety and paragraph cuts create forward propulsion, earning high-band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense: “woven bridges creaking softly as if whispering secrets to the wind” does triple duty (sound, motion, secrecy). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stake or texture. One mixed metaphor—“quiet fire that burned brighter”—is momentary, not repeated, and does not touch closure. Opening and closing lines are anchored and resonant; paragraph cuts are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The gravity inversion was coming” anchors stakes and clock; “seeds drifted upward like stars” closes the arc. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse, each metaphor (apples as dandelion seeds) precise. One minor filter verb cluster (“She understood now”) barely dulls the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every paragraph advances position, knowledge, or pressure. One mixed metaphor (“city itself was breathing” beside “joint popping”) is momentary. No loops, no scaffold, no over-modification; the final sentence lands with sonic snap, earning high-band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—description advances stakes: “the aurora’s hues flickering like candle flames in a draft” both paints and signals instability. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the last rather than restates. Filter verbs are minimal and motivated. A single mixed vehicle—“colors…curling around her like smoke” beside “heartbeat of the earth”—is minor enough not to dull the climax. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the bell strikes.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative layers are selective (sliver of captured sun, reeds in the wind). One paraphrase loop inside the cavern—“something older, something that didn’t belong”—slows momentum. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing sentences form a satisfying echoic bracket. Line-level artifacts do not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “equations that mapped the weight of sorrow, the velocity of joy” compresses theme and world in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds sensory or causal layer. Metaphors stay coherent—predator-grin equation, rib-barnacles—without mixed vehicles. Minor elevated diction (“deliberate ambiguity was his method”) is earned by the academic POV; no artifacts touch the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is rhythmically varied, high-density, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layering is purposeful, not purple. One mixed metaphor (“ridgeway like a scar across the sky”) but clarity intact. Clean grammar and tense. Final line crystallizes without overwriting. Minor hairline keeps it below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence openings diversify. Figurative language dense but patterned (light/bending/mist) and coherent. One paraphrase loop: “absorbed it, held it, until Elias had come to listen” restates without new pressure. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold clutter. Information density high; every paragraph advances knowledge or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies without algorithmic drift; sentence openings diversify. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors. One scaffold trace: “the silence was raveling around her, thick as wool” repeats the raveling concept already shown by frayed shawl, a −0.2 loop that keeps the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean: “quiet promise against the anvil” packs two sensory metaphors without crowding. One paraphrase loop—“the way the wind howled… the way the rocks hummed”—but it serves as incantatory cataloguing. No mixed metaphors in the closure beat; azure vein image is precise. Occasional adjective padding (“eerie blue light”) could trim, yet momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, high-density; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop—“the repair bay wasn’t just a nexus—it was a gate”—is justified as emphatic beat. Strong verbs and concrete nouns carry description; final line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: “luminescent ache,” “ghost of light”—figurative bursts are rationed, never stacked. No filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, action, or interiority. Opening line anchors stakes and tone; final line releases without exposition. Occasional adjectival flourish (“bruised twilight”) is justified by POV’s poetic reticence.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary from short pulse to winding accumulative clauses that mimic light spirals; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“blade of bottled lightning”) and paid off in the mirror-city reveal. One mixed metaphor—“threads were time itself”—is momentarily abstract, yet the loom image is immediately grounded by the physical act of turning the lantern.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lyrically dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers light, color, or story without paraphrase loops. Figurative chains (“hover between stillness and flight,” “sleeping giant”) stay coherent under the Accumulative lens. One mixed metaphor—“quiet explosiveness”—is allowed by pattern. No scaffold or register drift; final image lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid yet lean; metaphor chains (moonlight as mercury, roots as veins) stay coherent and serve closure. One scaffold loop: “the tower… the tower…” echo could trim. No filter-verb stacks; syntax varies. High information density—each paragraph advances map, body, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective, never clustering in high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop (“the people… the people…”) is minor. Strong verbs dominate; only one filter verb slips in. No grammar or pronoun errors; paragraph cuts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “truths folded into themselves like origami” does triple duty—metaphor, character lens, theme. One paraphrase loop—“never quite healed” echoing “quiet ache”—is purposeful, not scaffold. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beat. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve by image. Minor: “enlarged tranquility” could feel overwritten to some ears but fits the paradox mode.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative layering is restrained and purposeful. One scaffold echo—“the way things slip… the way the river…”—is allowed because it teaches the pattern. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; paragraph cuts are crisp. A single paraphrase loop (“real… real… real”) nicks the final third, disallowing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figuratives (“cathedral of ice,” “quartz hush”) recur but are pattern-taught and payoff in final hush. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor over-modification (“spectral glow,” “luminous and fleeting”) slightly dilutes peak beat; still, clarity and momentum remain intact through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; metaphor count stays selective. One paraphrase loop (“the night itself had paused”) and a simultaneous participle (“pressing it into her palm with a look”) create minor turbulence. Otherwise clauses stay crisp, verbs strong, no scaffolding clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose propels: varied sentence rhythm, high-density lines doing two jobs (“roots sending electrical impulses…like schools of fish”). No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language stays coherent under auroral logic. One near-repeat—“swaying in unison as if swayed”—but cadence absorbs it without dulling closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry double duty—action, sensory hit, emotional tilt—without scaffold; metaphor is selective (“laughter poured out like honey”) and avoids purple drift. One paraphrase loop (“He had spent years down here…”) costs a −0.2; otherwise rhythm breathes with the beats.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong density—single sentences fuse action, sensory detail, and emotional tilt. Occasional modifiers (“sky the color of old bruises”) verge on familiar, but metaphor stays consistent to bruise/bloom palette; no loops or scaffold. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with changing parts of speech. High density: “kinetic sculpture of spun silver and hollow reeds” does triple duty (material, motion, sound). One paraphrase loop (“the bells remained. / And the bells remembered”) is purposeful incantation, not scaffold. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry dual duty (“The roses were gone, but the farm was still alive”). Figurative density peaks only at climax and is pattern-taught. Strong verbs (“shuddered,” “smoldering”) replace modifiers. Final line lands with cadence shift that recharges opening static, meeting 9+ ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentences vary in length and openers. Figurative language is frequent but patterned early, so density feels intentional rather than cluttered. One paraphrase loop (“the kind of quiet that only comes…”) and a filter verb cluster around “felt” slightly dull immediacy, yet no artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm, propel without scaffold; figurative language is selective (“rusted girders groaning like a dying beast”) and never clutters the high-pressure hatch-opening beat; zero loops or register drift, clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative layering (salt, echo, spiral) recurs with variation, not clutter. One scaffold pair—“the night his sister vanished, the night the whale’s song…”—repeats information without new pressure. Otherwise rhythm modulates, no mixed metaphors, and the final sentence lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled, sentences vary, no template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“smoothed hush,” “dying-fire breath”) and pays off in final star image. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. One scaffold: “not a warning, but a wound” is immediately restated; could compress. Otherwise clean, propulsive, and closure-clear.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; sentences vary in length to match emotional breath. No paraphrase loops or filler stacks. Figurative language is selective—meteor trails as “fleeting silver”—and stays coherent. One minor scaffold: “she had come here every week since his passing” could compress, but it does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and musical: "petals, heavy with dew, absorbed sound like a thief" performs three jobs (image, sensory shift, metaphor) in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances memory, atmosphere, or choice. One mixed metaphor—"sunlight through stained glass" for a voice—survives because it’s character-filtered longing. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs ("flared," "trembled") propel momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry dual duty—description and emotional calculus. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay coherent: stalactite tears = slow justice; aurora = shifting moral light. A single mixed image—“shadow swallowing the light”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and rhythmic; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“stone paths coiled like frozen serpents” anchors mood without clutter. High information density: every paragraph advances knowledge or atmosphere. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is spare—only “glacier’s ancient breath,” “borrowed starlight”—each earns its place and charges closure. One minor scaffold: “she’d been analyzing cameo appearances…” tells a method that could have been shown in one micro-beat, but the lapse is brief and early.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold, only one mixed metaphor (“moon path pooled on stones”). Sensory nouns and strong verbs carry the lift; paragraph cuts are purposeful, propelling the quiet accretion toward the final shared stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences advance knowledge or image. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“letters clutched in his gloved hand” burning—momentarily muddles tactile and thermal senses, but it does not touch closure. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“sinking,” “pieced,” “shifted”) drive momentum. Clean enough for 8-band, not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong imagistic density—“domes clawing like fingers of a drowning man”—but two mixed metaphors in the same line dull impact. Occasional scaffold (“He had spent thirty years…”) could be trimmed; otherwise rhythm propels descent without loops or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly loop-free; occasional soft repeats (“the kind that…”) and a late cluster of abstract nouns (“purpose, silence, dust”) slightly dull the final paragraph’s edge, keeping it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean: no scaffold, no synonym loops; figurative language (ice sang, bones creak) appears sparingly and only when it advances sensory stakes. Sentence rhythm accelerates across dock sprint, then cuts to single-word heartbeat lines under water. One mixed metaphor risk—“azure coat blending into twilight” beside frost—passes quickly without muddling causality. Final paragraph earns quiet cadence after sonic crescendo, satisfying read-aloud ear.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is rhythmic and information-dense; figurative layering (“jagged crown,” “broken promise” moon) is selective, never crowding a single beat. Occasional scaffold—“he had… he had… he had…”—recycles openings but stops short of marring the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences carry double duty: “smelled of damp concrete and rust, a scent that clung…”—setting + character residue. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor (light as scalpel) is used once and discarded. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs—“cut,” “trace,” “slipped”—propel. One mixed metaphor cluster (“tunnel seemed to breathe”) is marginal and does not obscure causality at closure. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, satisfying read-aloud ear.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm modulates from measured opening to staccato final paragraph. Figurative language is sparse, purposeful: “time itself were a thread he could unravel” fits Kael’s deliberation. No loops or scaffold; pronouns clean. One near-miss: “weight pressing against his ribs” borders cliché but is immediately re-seized by the heart image.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is lean yet textured; every sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors avoided—acid, gears, bell resonance stay physically coherent. One scaffold risk: “motion into resonance, resonance into something like meaning” borders tautology but is saved by immediate tactile payoff. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; final paragraph’s single-sentence beats land like hammer strikes.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentences vary in length and propel; information density is high. Minor loop: “the numbers appeared…4-7-11” restates twice within fifty words; one metaphor mix—“echoes linger like ghosts” plus “digital graveyard”—slightly blurs sonic vs spatial imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean, image-rich, largely loop-free; occasional poetic overlap (“ice screamed”) is earned. One scaffold paraphrase (“weight in his chest lifted”) repeats prior release without new charge. Strong verbs dominate; metaphors stay coherent. Final line lands with cadence that re-illuminates prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional adjective pairs (“low, mournful creak”) stay purposeful. Strong sentence variety and paragraph breath. One paraphrase loop: “sound of endings” is repeated four times—acceptable under accumulative pattern but slightly dilutes final punch.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. One paraphrase loop—“the way the amber light caught the silver at his temples” immediately after describing his eyes—drops it from 8+. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the pavilion sighed…into a deeper stillness” does triple duty—atmosphere, causal cue, closure cadence. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One near-overwrite—“a thousand unspoken truths”—survives the artifact screen because it is the only abstract intensifier in the climax and is immediately grounded by tactile hum.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“vines that curled like fingers” lands once and serves tone). One paraphrase loop—“how the light… how the vines… how the lavender…”—creates momentary template cadence but occurs pre-closure and does not obscure causality. Strong verbs anchor every beat; no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, and information-dense; figurative language serves sonic theme without purple drift. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “botanical impossibility”) stays within scholar-POV lexicon. Final paragraph crystallizes prior motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Occasional poetic elevation (“marrow of his bones,” “wax”) is earned by the accumulative texture. Punctuation and tense are clean; spatial tracking flawless. One mixed vehicle—“fog curled around his ankles, thick as memory”—but it occurs mid-scene, not at closure, so the artifact is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: every sentence advances image or stakes; no paraphrase loops. Figurative layer (starlight pools, dying breath) is sparse enough to avoid purple drag; mixed-metaphor check clean. Strong verbs (pried, unscrewed, burned through) propel beats. One minor scaffold: “the station itself was resisting his work” anthropomorphizes without sensory proof—costs −0.2. Otherwise rhythm breathes with escalation; final line lands with echoic snap.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and multi-tasking: “He began to sing, his voice low and steady, weaving a melody around the simplest of images…” advances action, atmosphere, and theme in one breath. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and accurate. A single near-redundant phrase—“pulsing stillness deepening into something like reverence”—is allowable at climax and does not dull the image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and mostly loop-free; occasional minor scaffold (“she understood,” “she smiled”) slightly dulls final beat. Metaphors are coherent—ink into water, cracked-window voice—and do not clog high-pressure moment. Sentence variety propels descent. One paraphrase loop costs −0.2; no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences vary in length and opening, with no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“star trapped in enamel”). The single possible micro-loop—“the garden sighed around them like a held breath finally released”—is earned by the prior pattern of breath imagery and does not obscure causality. Clean copy, no artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong verbs and concrete nouns; only one paraphrase loop (“light…without burning anyone, least of all herself”). Figurative layer is disciplined—mist as dragon, glass as moon-capture—never dense enough to stall momentum. Final paragraph lands with cadence shift that mirrors the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense without purple drift. No paraphrase loops or template cadences. Strong verbs (“swung,” “split,” “unraveling”) carry weight, modifiers sparse. One clause (“like the ribs of some slumbering beast”) skirts cliché but is saved by immediate tactile follow-up. Final sentence earns its uplift through prior drip imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean and sensory, with only one paraphrase loop (“fleeting and fragile and real”). Metaphors stay coherent: mist like living thing, river pushing with insistence—no mixed vehicles. Filter verbs are minimal; strong verbs (“waded,” “clutched,” “swallowed”) propel momentum. A faint register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “liminal space”—is earned by the protagonist’s literary mindset and does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long cathedral sentence vs. staccato “She laughed.” Figurative layer is selective—no mixed metaphors—and information-dense: “tendril… newborn’s fist” does double sensory job. Only minor scaffold: “something older, something like” is filler that could compress, but it never touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive: each sentence advances image or stakes; no loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“silence pressing like snow” returns as “stillness between heartbeats,” creating coherent texture. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif; paragraph cuts are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) and rhythm breathes with scene temperature. Metaphors are spare—smoke-like figure, firefly echoes—and stay coherent within the cavern’s light logic. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; only a faint echo of “light…light” in adjacent images. High information density with zero grammar stumbles; the final line lands with hush rather than flourish, earning its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and stress, propelling the calcification beat; figurative layering is dense but purposeful—no mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. One paraphrase loop (“weight…heavy…heaviest”) costs −0.2, keeping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“steam like a ghost testing edges”—never muddled. Information density high: tea unfurling as drowning dancers compresses time and emotion. No artifacts in final third; line-level craft supports rather than decorates the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; no synonym loops or scaffold. Metaphors are few but precise—“time slipping through fingers” justifies the camera’s empty click. One mixed register slip: “conceptual repricing” tone in “negotiating with her own ghost” momentarily lifts above scavenger idiom, but recovers quickly. Final paragraph breathes correctly, mirroring release.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“neon residue…half-remembered promise”). One scaffold pair appears (“She had come to assess decay, but she was leaving with something else—a blueprint for resilience”) where second clause restates the obvious; otherwise no loops or register drift, and closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm modulates: long oil-and-parchment clauses early, short cold-bite fragments during the bear walk. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are sparse and coherent—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors both vocation and stillness in one stroke. One minor scaffold: “the city of Vaelis still slept” repeats the sleep idea in adjacent clause, but the echo serves cadence and is not repeated elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; each sentence advances atmosphere or motive. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent (dying stars, tide, warped glass) and culminate in the mirror’s refracted hold. One mixed register slip—“conceptual repricing” diction in interiority—pulls back from perfection but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; figurative layers (sleeping giant, oceanic hush) recur with pattern discipline. One scaffold loop—“the snow kept falling, the dock kept creaking”—is intentional cadence rather than filler. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains pristine through the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent—“thread…veins of the earth”—and do not overcluster. One mixed vehicle: “shadows clung…like old grief” adjacent to “thread…hummed” slightly blurs tactile vs. auditory, but not at closure. Strong read-aloud flow.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gilded towers swaying gently on chains thicker than ancient oaks” fuses visual and kinetic data in one stroke. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors total, each reweighted at closure. No paraphrase loops; every sentence advances stakes or texture. Minor alliterative drift (“slow, inevitable grace of a flower unfurling”) stays subordinate to clarity, not obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose carries a read-aloud cadence without algorithmic pattern; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. Figurative layer is restrained—only two metaphors in 700 words—keeping the lagoon’s mirror uncluttered. One scaffold: “she had come… she had stayed” is mild recap; no loops or register drift touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; sentence openings vary. High density—each line advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor cluster (“mouths agape like silent witnesses… moss surrendered to dust”) but clarity survives. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—one simile per beat, never stacked. Information density high: “brass teeth spinning… approximated infinity” does world-building, stakes, and sensory work in one line. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor hedge “just enough to remind” could be cut, but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive: “sun bled into dusk” does double duty for time and emotional tint. One paraphrase loop—“ribbon pooling in his lap like a living thing” followed by “ribbon warm against his skin”—redundant tactile cue, but it does not stall momentum. No mixed metaphors; granite, ribbon, butterflies stay in separate sensory lanes. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“noticed the faintest scent”) they serve meditative delay rather than dilution.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective—“jagged teeth biting into the restless sea” sets tone without overcrowding later beats. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; the single mixed metaphor (“time into perfect, forgiving slices”) is minor and does not touch the closure beat. Strong information density and varied rhythm support momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “current lapped at the shore like a cat at a saucer of milk” does double sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances map, memory, or motive. One mixed metaphor—“cold light pooling in hollows”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; figurative language is selective (“blade of black glass,” “liquid sky”). No loops or scaffold detected. Occasional elevated phrasing—“fertile ground beyond”—is earned by context. Sentence variety supports momentum; opening and closing lines bracket the arc effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, and propulsive; every sentence either advances the ritual or deepens atmosphere. Figurative language is selective—dust “swirled like a tiny storm,” radio glow “spilled like liquid gold”—and never clusters into purple. No loops, scaffold, or register drift detected. One tiny filter-verb trio (“he began to glow… began to form… began to speak”) could be trimmed, but it occurs early and does not obscure the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. High information density—each sentence moves image, body, or stakes. A single participle opener (“Watching his breath curl”) is acceptable within the hush tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences show varied rhythm and strong verbs; information density is high—“sewers reeked… but Elias didn’t mind” layers stakes, attitude, and sensory data in nine words. Occasional lofted diction (“conceptual repricing” terrain) nudges register drift. No loops or mixed metaphor in peak beats; line-level artifacts are minor and do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyrical yet information-dense: each sentence advances atmosphere or beat. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “ice over a pond” is singular and apt. One paraphrase loop—“the kind that lived in the silences between notes” restated two sentences later—triggers a −0.2. Otherwise rhythm modulates, paragraph lengths vary, and no filter-verb clusters stall immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional softeners (“unnatural pace,” “world dissolved”) edge toward cliché; no loops or scaffold, rhythm breathes with scene beats, and metaphor stays coherent under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences advance image or causality without scaffold. Figurative layer is controlled—two metaphors per beat at most—and coherent: tower as “skeletal sentinel,” flame smelling of “ozone and burnt sugar.” No paraphrase loops or template cadence. A single mixed image—“drone beehives hovered like dying stars”—barely grazes physical logic but does not obscure the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; mixed-length sentences create natural ebb. One scaffold pair (“Not a sigh, not a groan, but...”) is purposeful emphasis, not loop. Figurative language is spare and precise—“shadows rearranged” conjures the uncanny without purple overlay. Clean copy, zero typos.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: “swirling like captured twilight” does double duty—visual and metaphorical. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent (water, veins, confession) and do not clot the climax. Strong verbs (“shattered,” “lashed,” “wove”) carry motion without adverbial crutch.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, with only one paraphrase loop (“then another, then another”). Metaphors are sparse and coherent; no mixed vehicles. Strong verbs (“shuddered,” “spiderwebbing”) propel the rupture. A single filter-verb cluster (“felt warm, or maybe that was just the heat of his resolve”) slightly dulls immediacy, preventing 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “the ink would flow, and the world would narrow to the whisper of bristles on paper” compresses time and sensation. Metaphors stay consistent—moonlight as liquid silver, smog as wool—without contradiction. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cut test passes. One mixed vehicle (“sealing the panes with putty mixed from her own spit and stubbornness”) is earned by voice. High-band clarity and propulsion; closure image untouched by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; occasional soft repeats (“golden… golden”) and faint poetic uplift (“rosewater dread”) but no loops or mixed metaphors. Final line lands with snap.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every sentence twins action with metaphor (“gears click into place like vertebrae”). No loops, no filter-verb stacks. One mixed vehicle—“dying breath against the storm”—is allowable at opening. The final paragraph’s repeated “wound… dropped” cadence is intentional callback, not template, so momentum stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; figurative language is selective rather than stacked. One mixed metaphor cluster (“silvered surfaces warped…like elastic”) but it does not obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Opening and closing lines are sharp, propulsive. Minor synonym echo (“lingering luminance” twice) keeps the score just below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density—each sentence layers sensory, metaphoric, and forward drive; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Occasional stacked figuratives (“fractal paths the wind carved through the sky”) flirt with excess but occur pre-climax and do not obscure causality; final strike is clean, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevated phrasing (“sunwashed dread”) fits tone, but “the darkness yawned” edges cliché, a −0.2 nudge. Sentence variety propels the sprint finale. Clean copy; no clarity breaks. Within hailing distance of 9-band if final metaphor were more particular to shell or map lore.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry double duty—action, atmosphere, and thematic echo in single strokes (“ivy that crept inward like grasping fingers”). Metaphors stay coherent and sparse enough to avoid purple drag. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; opening and closing images form a tidy palindrome without forcing. A single filter-verb cluster (“He recognized her then”) is harmless amid otherwise strong verb propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “its absence was interlaced with the town’s memory” does double duty (setting + theme). No synonym loops; metaphors consistent (river/time). One minor scaffold: “He wrote again” could be cut, but does not obscure causality. Read-aloud rhythm varies; no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is spare and purposeful. Minor overuse of participial openers (“casting dappled shadows”) softens peak beat. High information density; only hairline slips keep it under 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—image plus causal push (“she would polish them…until they fit perfectly into the lanterns”). Figurative layering is dense but patterned early, so the lyric overload at the climax reads as earned crescendo rather than purple drift. Zero paraphrase loops; each crane mention adds a new physical or emotional angle. A single mixed metaphor—“raw wound of violet and gold”—is marginal and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The circuit breakers below her feet hissed as they cooled, their heat bleeding into the metal grating” advances time, sets stakes, and textures sound. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors in 700 words, each charged (beast, dying bulb, heat off pavement). No scaffold loops; each paragraph shifts knowledge or tactical option. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing” in prior log—reads as in-world jargon, not author intrusion. Closure line (“The hunt wasn’t over. It had only just begun.”) is deliberate echo of opening, earning its cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences do two jobs. Occasional poetic uplift (“cloak woven from starlight”) risks purple but is balanced by concrete tooling. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs carry motion. Final paragraph could lose one adjective (“dim light swallowing them whole”) without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; no paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Metaphors (“guilt was a sieve”) recur but each re-weights meaning. Clause rhythm accelerates toward the key acceptance, then snaps short—mechanical echo of hour-hand. One near-miss: “weight of unspoken words pressing… like a second heartbeat” borders cliché, but context rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long mist-laden clauses to the staccato of the final step-back. Figurative language is selective—moon “like a blade,” parapet “like a scar”—and each reappears to charge closure. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; one paraphrase loop (“step back, then another”) is purposeful echo, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean, with high information density; each sentence advances stance or image. One scaffold loop—“the way his father’s expectations had once been indifferent to his own desires” restates prior beat. Metaphors stay consistent (navigation, gravity, tide); no mixed vehicles. Final line cadence lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—no metaphor clutter. One paraphrase loop (“He wasn’t here for redemption—redemption was a myth…”) is deliberate emphasis, not scaffold. No filter-verb stacks or synonym churn; high information density maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, avoiding template cadence; information density is high—one line often does scent, action, and emotional tilt (“The paste sizzled in her palm, smoke curling into the shape of wings”). Figurative layer is selective: ember-fruit, candle-flame edges, silver tears, each image returning in mutated form to keep the metamorphosis motif coherent. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. A single mixed vehicle—“branches heavy… glowed like embers” plus “scent thick with the memory of cinnamon and clove”—compresses two heat sources, but the overlap is brief and doesn’t tangle the climax, so the slip stays sub-deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; only one paraphrase loop (“edges frayed like the edges of her resolve”) slightly dulls propulsion. Figurative layering is dense but patterned, taught early by ink-bleed and cloud breath.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; every sentence either stitches atmosphere or advances the ritual. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent—“a pocket of the universe where time had folded in on itself” is abstract but physically legible within the SF frame. Only micro-flaw: “the ship shuddered” repeats twice in quick succession, a tiny cadence echo.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence fronts, high information density. One paraphrase loop: “he had felt the tremors, the way the earth shifted beneath his feet like a restless sleeper” restates prior tremor hint. Metaphors stay coherent (volcano as sleeper, bug as dying star). No filter-verb clusters or register drift. Minor scaffold keeps it sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse, patterned, and paid off—“dying heartbeat” echoes in the final held breath. Strong verbs (“pried,” “slipped,” “flared”) replace modifiers. One mixed moment—“pulse a quiet drum in her throat”—is minor amid otherwise precise embodiment. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: every image pulls double duty (“ribbons of green and violet weaving through the salt-stiff air” sets both sky and sensory deprivation). No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; star-dust and painted rocks retain literal integrity while accruing symbolic charge. Sentence variety modulates from auroral sweep to staccato placement beats. One tiny scaffold—“the patterns were unraveling” echoes “the world had nearly unraveled”—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; mixed metaphors are controlled (“storm outside was furiously tranquil” is taught early and paid off). One paraphrase loop (“he had come here not to observe… but to wait… though for what, he wasn’t entirely sure”) could be trimmed. Otherwise density is high, rhythm varied, no scaffold in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; figurative language is spare and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) fits POV. Final line lands with imagistic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty—action plus metaphor—without purple drift; only minor scaffold (“he’d...he’d...”) in the prison flashback, and the final clause “he didn’t feel like molting” is crisp, propelling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet musical: “the salt-tinged mist that curled around the pianist’s fingers” does double sensory duty while advancing atmosphere. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language thins during the high-pressure encore, letting short, jagged syntax mimic the cliff-jump the piece embodies. Clean mechanics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet luminous: “bioluminescent blossoms that pulsed like slow heartbeats” does triple sensory work without adjective overload. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or knowledge. Metaphors stay coherent—storm as thief, memory as garden—and culminate in the bracelet-vine image. One hairline slip: “empirically whimsical” feels editorial, not Liora’s idiom, but it’s brief.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory or symbolic density without scaffold. No loops or synonym churn; metaphors (compass caught in tides of remembrance) stay coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” territory) but justified by tutor’s reflective lexicon. Final paragraph avoids overwriting, letting thread-catch-light image carry weight.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose achieves high information density: “glass panes cracked like spiderwebs” conveys fragility, storm violence, and organic patterning in one image. Figurative language is coherent—dust as “map,” “galaxies,” “whisper”—without muddle. Minor scaffold in “she had spent years chasing… but the flood…” slightly slows momentum, but closure beat (“dust would keep falling. And she would keep watching”) earns its lyricism through prior specificity. Zero paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “frost-kissed stones,” “blackened husk,” “charcoal smuggler’s ledger strip” do double duty. Minor overwriting in “patterns as familiar as the scars on her wrists”—slightly strained simile—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“She had been…”, “Now…”, “The canyon…”). Final paragraph’s cadence slows purposefully, matching Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or concept. Figurative language is consistent (frost as “silent symphonies,” conservatory as “frozen leviathan”) without muddle. Minor overwriting in early paragraphs (“delicate, silent symphonies of ice”) slightly dilutes momentum, but peak beats avoid purple prose. Final paragraph’s cadence—short clauses, concrete verbs—propels closure without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “jagged edges catching... like teeth” does double duty (image + threat). Figurative language is controlled—lens hum as “distant foghorn” pays off later as chorus. Minor redundancy in “fractured rainbows across his workbench” / “fractures refracting” slightly dulls opening, but no scaffold loops. Final paragraph’s cadence (“The light returned... warm and golden”) earns its lyricism through accumulated texture.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, vivid, and multi-sensory (“dusk bled into twilight,” “chime muted, as though the bell itself was holding its breath”). High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting in “whispering secrets to the wind” leans slightly purple but is redeemed by grounded follow-ups. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; final paragraph’s “amplified quiet” lands with precision. Read-aloud rhythm breathes naturally across varied sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“iron ribs draped in wisteria,” “love she had never spent”). Figurative language is coherent (breath as spark, memory as drowned thing) and peaks without muddle. Minor overwriting in “wisteria that bloomed violet even as twilight bled” slightly dilutes urgency, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift dulls the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“the air hummed with the weight of memories not yet faded”). Figurative language is precise and consistent (time as burning, unraveling, fraying); no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary naturally; paragraph lengths shift with emotional intensity. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—e.g., “petals curled inward… grin melted into a scream” shows reversal without telling. Closure image (“let the past rest”) resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “rusted into skeletal silence” conveys decay and sound in one phrase. Syntax varies purposefully—fragmented during tension (“They’re marking the vault”), flowing at resolution. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (chains/lightness, seeds/growth). Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “monstrous thing of gears and teeth,” though it serves Mira’s awe.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield. Metaphors cohere (shipwrecks as overripe fruit, silence as color) without muddle. Minor artifact: slight overuse of simile in opening paragraph (“like distant radio waves,” “like overripe fruit,” “like old bones”), but none obscure causality or dull closure.

    Prose is dense and musical without overwriting: “the city itself exhaled,” “light spilled across the dome.” Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with tension. One minor loop: “pulse” appears three times in close proximity (lines 2, 24, 35), slightly dulling impact. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)

    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ribcage of salt-bleached wood” merges setting and metaphor without strain; “stars seemed to hold their breath” avoids cliché through specificity. Sentences vary rhythmically—fragments for tension (“It sank without a sound”), cascading clauses for dance. One minor slip: “lightly attentive” repeats without deepening, but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or purple prose; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield (“nostalgia ban… outlawed remembrance,” “inked with constellations that shifted when he moved”). Figurative language is coherent (sea/wind/skin/stars interwoven) and escalates purposefully toward the tattooing climax. Minor scaffold: “rolled the speck between her fingers during storms” slightly paraphrases earlier handling. No loops or register drift; final paragraph’s “scent of salt and distant storms” echoes opening without redundancy. Deduct 0.2 for one near-redundant clause (“pulsed like a second heartbeat” after “anchored to her heartbeat”).

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“breath curling like mist,” “spectral shards,” “walls lined with ledgers”—each phrase advancing atmosphere or character. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with the narrative pulse. One minor flaw: “phrases just beyond comprehension, like a language half-remembered” risks cliché, though quickly redeemed by concrete action. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; figurative language remains coherent and physically grounded throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “ink bleeding into the paper like water through cracked earth” fuses image, theme, and closure. Minor overwriting in the opening (“liquid mercury”) risks purple prose, but the metaphor pays off in the box’s “shattered dreams” webbing. No loops or scaffolding; sentence variety supports emotional cadence. One near-paraphrase (“quiet theft of something irreplaceable” / “things that don’t leave marks”) slightly dulls momentum but doesn’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: sentences multitask (e.g., “tide-polished quartz” conveys setting, time, and texture). Rhythm varies effectively—longer descriptive lines give way to staccato beats during the climax. Minor overwriting in the dream sequence (“balloons drifting through endless skies”) edges toward purple prose, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final line (“work had only just begun”) resonates without redundancy, closing the cadence cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “pages singed but still legible in fragments” conveys backstory, object state, and emotional weight).

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “the drought was his doing” compresses motive, guilt, and scale in five words. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating toward climax (“He placed… He hesitated… He released”) then breathing into elegiac closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image pulls double duty (thunder = withheld emotion, salt = artificial purity). Figurative language is precise—egg “hummed with the ghost of a song”—and never muddles causality or dulls the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful: metaphors (“frozen surface glinting like shattered glass”) serve theme and mood. However, peak beats risk overwriting—e.g., “moment stretched between sigh and smile, a fragile eternity” uses two near-synonymous time metaphors in one clause. No paraphrase loops, but figurative density in the sanctuary entrance slightly blurs propulsion. Final paragraph tightens effectively, redeeming earlier ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and momentum (“brass arms bent like the ribs of a dying bird”).

Final line (“The mirror maker smiled”) earns its simplicity through accumulated tension.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density—“slopes jagged with the spines of books” establishes setting, metaphor, and tone in one stroke.

Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent sentences describing the first monument’s shadow (“stretching like a finger pointing toward the horizon, where the fog had hardened…”), verging on paraphrase-loop. Otherwise, rhythm varies skillfully, metaphors cohere (fog as memory, shadows as time-absorbers), and closure image lands unblurred. No scaffold or artifact dulls the final beat.

Final line crystallizes motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “spun glass, thin as a whisper” avoids purple excess by tying metaphor to function (the disc makes no sound). Sentence openings vary (“Her booth…”, “The glass harmonica…”, “Cultivated estrangement…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., ending caller vignettes before returning to Mara).

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ivory choked with ivy that spilled like green waterfalls” establishes tone in one breath. Figurative language is controlled—moon rock “hummed faintly,” logistician moves “like smoke”—with no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One minor redundancy: “fragments of that rumor, each one more improbable than the last” slightly paraphrases the prior sentence about rumors slithering, but it serves rhythmic buildup, not loop.

    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“The anomaly made it easier, distorting time just enough that cause and effect blurred like watercolors” advances setting, stakes, and theme). Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors—and the “watercolors” simile pays off in the editing/gardening motifs. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional beats, and the final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes momentum. One minor slip: “strange comfort” slightly edges toward label-speak, but it’s immediately grounded in Elias’s “creased” face.

Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors the thematic cadence of release and listening.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “mist curled like smoke” establishes texture without overwriting, and “ragged edge… smoothed into something cleaner, stronger” does triple duty (action, metaphor, character arc). Minor scaffold in “he’d believed… now that belief felt…” slightly paraphrases, but it’s brief and bridges to decisive action. No mixed metaphors; diction stays within Elias’s lexicon (e.g., “specimens,” not “artifacts”).

    High information density: “rusty girders whispering secrets,” “hum surged… like a heartbeat.” But minor overwriting appears in peak beats—e.g., “sound so vast it swallowed the world” risks abstraction. No paraphrase loops, yet “broken things… find meaning in the shards” borders on label-speak. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with two successive abstractions (“quiet certainty,” “fire wasn’t gone”).

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “water churned, dark and thick as blood” does triple duty (image, mood, foreshadowing). Minimal loops; varied syntax avoids monotony. One slight overwriting in “veins of heat and life”—borderline mixed metaphor—but paid off by the earth’s hum at climax. Final line’s kite simile earns its lyricism through earlier setup.

Some conversations…”) delivers earned lyricism without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “tranquil blaze,” “engraved quiet,” “ballast sandbag scrap” all do thematic and atmospheric work. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs.

Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Minor density issue: two adjacent lines describe reeds “shrieked, they sighed, they moaned” and “pulsed beneath his fingers, whispering of longing”—slight paraphrase loop, but not in closure beat. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly echoes tidal ebb.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the nib snapped clean in his fist” conveys violence economically. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“orbits of regret”) and payoff-integrated.

Final line (“the lines began to glow”) recharges all prior imagery with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or conflict.

Final paragraph’s propulsion (“She picked up another tessera”) delivers quiet momentum without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “the air hummed with the scent of ripe apples and something older, something that tasted like lightning on his tongue” conveys setting, synesthesia, and mood in one breath. Sentence rhythms vary purposefully—short staccato phrases during tension (“The garden held its breath”), lyrical flow in reflection. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language (“ripples spreading outward, warping time itself”) coheres without muddle, though “flicker of movement in the corner of the eye” slightly verges on cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose balances density and propulsion: “phosphorescent paint on the walls pulsed like a slow heartbeat” does triple duty (setting, rhythm, metaphor). Minor overwriting in “fractally precise” repetition (lines 2 and 13), but pattern pays off in closure’s thread-weaving.

    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is restrained but potent (“chimney smoke flattens into the sky,” “cracks catching light like veins”). Minor issue: slight overuse of “the way” constructions in mid-story (“in the way the wind hummed… in the way the lavender still bloomed”), creating a faint template cadence. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks, and closure image is crystal-clear. High information density without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “rippling like liquid silver” establishes motif paid off in final lantern reflection. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional beats.

No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “silver veins across the stone floor” merges setting and mood; “angles that defied physics” conveys impossibility without jargon.

Minor scaffold in “he dreamed again, but this time…” could be tighter, but no paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Final line (“But I will”) lands with clean propulsion. Deduction only for one slightly ornamental phrase (“salt-tinged air”) that doesn’t pull weight.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language (“secrets coiled like smoke,” “hush of cosmic possibility”) is consistent and purposeful, never muddled. Minor scaffold in “the idea trapped inside Elara was not hers—it belonged…” slightly paraphrases prior implication. Otherwise, zero loops, strong verbs, varied rhythm, and closure image (“idea was free”) resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “glass panes long shattered by time and tide” conveys decay, history, and causality in seven words. Rhythm varies purposefully—longer descriptive lines yield to staccato fragments during climax (“Memories surged forward—not in images, but in sensations”). One minor loop: “chronically curious” appears twice, but second use ties to stalled habits, justifying recurrence. Figurative language remains coherent (mushrooms as “open palms,” voice “like the tide pulling away”), enhancing clarity without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “spines split like dry lips whispering secrets” merges setting and theme in one image. Sentence openings vary (“Her fingers trembled…”, “Outside, the hush…”, “Mira frowned…”), avoiding template cadence. Minor overwriting in “combative tenderness” slightly breaches POV lexicon, but figurative coherence holds—shards, shadows, and tea leaves form a consistent motif system. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“If she taught this girl…”) ties rhythm to thematic tension without scaffold or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “silver thread woven through the hush of budding hope” does triple duty (image, sound, theme). Figurative language is pattern-taught (weaving motif) and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“colors that had no name”) slightly blurs sense, but closure image remains sharp. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is precise (“silence pressed against his ears, a living thing”) and consistent. Minor overwriting in “shifting mosaic of faces—some weeping, some screaming, all silent,” but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“The threads screamed”) delivers propulsion and closure without muddle.

    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the silence around it had become a living thing, thick and suffocating” does triple duty. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “flickering” (lantern, film, frescoes), but not enough to dull closure. Final line lands with perfect cadence and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “fins stirring silt like ash from a forgotten fire” establishes tone and setting in one stroke. Figurative language is purposeful (snow “fine as bone dust”) and coheres with the motif of dissolution. Minor redundancy in “quietly analytic mind parsing the equations like a second language” slightly dulls immediacy, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter mar peak beats. Final paragraph’s cadence (“Death was still his first name…”) perfectly modulates rhythm to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“mist curled like a living thing,” “notes hung… golden and trembling”) without purple excess. Sentences vary rhythmically to match scene beats; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor flaw: slight overuse of simile in the opening paragraph (“like a living thing,” “like wind through reeds”) borders on density risk, but payoff justifies it. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “brass gears straining,” “pages shifting slightly as if breathing,” “world outside blurred into a haze of white and gold.” Figurative language is purposeful, not decorative—light refracts both physically and thematically. One minor flaw: “warmly inquisitive” edges toward label-speak, though quickly grounded in observed behavior. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; rhythm varies naturally to match emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“brass fittings groaning like a ship at sea” establishes sound, material, and unease). Figurative language is coherent (sky “bled into twilight,” clouds as “echoes”) without muddle.

Final line (“this moment, would remain”) resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-embellished (“creaked like an old man’s joints” borders on cliché). High information density: “brass-plated hull glowing faintly under the last embers of sunset” establishes time, place, and mood in one stroke. Minor redundancy in describing the phrasebook twice, but no fatal loops. Final line’s rhythm (“starlings took flight ahead of them”) perfectly mirrors forward momentum, closing the cadence with propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “driftwood nostalgia” conveys tone, setting, and theme in two words. Minor overwriting appears in “hauntingly bright in the dim light”—“dim” redundant after “frozen library above the clouds.” No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary purposefully. Final paragraph’s cadence accelerates cleanly into closure without muddling metaphor or logic.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “translucent form flickered like a candle in the wind” conveys state, metaphor, and fragility in one image. Figurative language is purposeful (“roots remember kindness”) without muddle.

Figurative language is pattern-taught (fractures, ripples, nested spirals) and culminates coherently in the pane’s song. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. One minor density risk—“bruised awe filling the air, thick as salt”—edges toward abstraction but earns it through tactile buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gnarled roots twisting through cracks in the stone,” “brass wings glinting in the dying light.” Figurative language is precise, not excessive; metaphors cohere (beggar’s grip, guilt as stone). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with tension. One minor redundancy: “heavy with fruit that would never ripen” appears twice—slightly dulls final cadence but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled—“braided ravine stretched like a scar,” “foam danced with the current”—without muddle or overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (moonlight “alive,” thoughts “mindfully scattered”) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “prismatic dust” and “seeds tossed into the wind” slightly dilutes peak beats, but no loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony disrupt momentum. Final lines (“The story was starting again”) earn their resonance through prior accumulation, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines: “adobe walls slick with the first rain in a decade” establishes setting, time, and emotional weight. Figurative language is coherent—grief as tide, sorrow as syrup—and never muddled. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. One minor slip: “sturdy brittle” slightly strains as compound modifier, but it’s intentional and paid off in the closing echo. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “brass hands frozen under the hush of borrowed starlight” conveys setting, mood, and theme in one image. Rhythm varies purposefully, though occasional overwriting appears (“stitching together the fragments of their lives”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; closure beat (“silos were still there, but now there were bridges”) is clear and resonant. Figurative coherence holds—clock mechanics consistently mirror social mechanics—but “borrowed starlight” slightly strains physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “shadows stretching like fingers” conveys atmosphere, character dread, and spatial layout simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully, with paragraph lengths mirroring emotional cadence.

Final line (“heart a quaking reverie”) perfectly encapsulates tone and stakes without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information yield per line (e.g., “moisture rose to meet her, forming perfect, fleeting impressions”). Figurative language is coherent—serpent/grotto, blaze/flame motifs align without contradiction. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “prismatic shards,” “latent blaze,” “specters” risk stacking modifiers, but cohesion holds. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s “flame in the dark” cleanly echoes earlier luminescence without redundancy.

Rhythm modulates perfectly: languid during reflection, staccato during strumming. One minor artifact: “ghost of it—a whisper of what might have been” edges toward abstraction, though immediately grounded by “shivered up his arm.” No loops, no scaffold—every sentence earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “light bent unnaturally,” “hum deepened,” “ink in water” avoid purple excess. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with intensity. Minor overwriting in “hues of violet and rust” (slightly decorative), but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“He wanted to see it through”) earns its simplicity after textured buildup—zero artifacts dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “wires snaking like veins,” “pause between a held breath and a sigh” do double duty. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence propels.

Final line’s firework imagery ties back to the opening sky, closing the sensory arc without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and varied (“swayed like a drowsy cat,” “wildflower hush”), with strong verbs and selective sensory detail. Minor overwriting in opening paragraph (“whispering secrets to the wind”) edges toward purple but serves tone. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, setting, or theme. Final line’s quiet closure (“And for the first time, Mira understood that”) earns its simplicity through accumulated texture.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and purposeful: “mercurial winds,” “whirling silence,” “fruit ripening in seconds, then bursting into seeds that drifted upward like stars.” Figurative language is coherent (harp-string hum, dandelion-seed apples) and never muddled.

Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates cleanly with inversion, and the closing line recharges the star-seed motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“shroud,” “city breathing”) is sparse and coherent, avoiding purple excess.

Final paragraph’s propulsion—“The labyrinth twisted… paths rearranging… city adapting”—delivers clean, high-stakes momentum without artifact or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “veins of blue and silver that pulsed in time with the breath of the wind” establishes setting, mood, and synesthesia in one stroke.

Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels atmosphere or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “avalanchingly quiet stillness that pressed against Elias’s ribs like a held breath” merges metaphor, sensation, and character state. Minor overwriting in “twisted light and shifting shadows” (slight redundancy), but no loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Final line’s callback to “held breath” recharges motif without paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict. Figurative language (“gaps like missing teeth,” “equations like a predator’s grin”) is consistent and purposeful, never muddled. Minor overwriting in “choir tuning itself in a language without vowels” slightly dilutes clarity, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s austerity (“fingers still stained… mind quiet”) earns its weight through prior accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ridgeway stretched like a scar across the sky” does setting, mood, and foreshadowing in one stroke. Figurative language is pattern-taught (pendant as living thing) and paid off (wings “trembling as if alive” → “exhausted”). Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “hummed/vibrated” near climax, but clarity at closure remains unharmed.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“spectral shards,” “shifted hush,” “truthful lies”—each phrase advancing atmosphere and theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting occurs in the opening (“crystalline branches fracturing the pale light into spectral shards” borders on purple), but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors dull clarity. Final line (“Just like everything else”) lands with earned simplicity after lyrical buildup, avoiding artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density (“roots clinging to pockets of soil in the hollows of the sky”). Figurative language is purposeful (silk “drank in light,” mine “groaned”), avoiding purple excess. Minor scaffold in “he moved carefully… lantern casting…”—slightly generic—but quickly redeemed by specific stakes.

    Prose is dense with purpose: “bruised twilight,” “luminescent ache,” “bottle it like fireflies” do triple duty—image, emotion, theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. One minor flaw: “warmly observant” borders on abstract personification, slightly muddying the otherwise concrete atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; figurative language remains coherent and POV-bound. Final line (“he didn’t feel alone in the dark”) resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“her fingers black with ink as she traced the obituaries of gods” establishes backstory, profession, and thematic scope in one stroke). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as blade, loom, ship) and payoff-consistent. Minor deduction for slight overuse of emerald/refraction motifs in the middle third—three consecutive sentences lean heavily on optical metaphors without new pressure. Still, line-level propulsion never stalls, and the final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors a lighthouse beam sweeping clean.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “bamboo stilts submerged... like the legs of a heron” establishes setting, metaphor, and tone in one stroke. Figurative language is controlled—no purple prose—and metaphors cohere (light, wings, mist, ink). Minor scaffold in “he had always been a watchful man, but now his watchfulness had a purpose” slightly flattens, but doesn’t dull closure. Final paragraph’s cadence shift earns its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “moonlight… pooling on the floor like mercury” conveys light, texture, and alchemical weight in one image.

Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in the climax (“roots like veins,” “branches forming words”), but clarity remains intact—no artifact dulls closure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “vines coiled around her ankles, not in threat, but in greeting” conveys setting, character, and tone in one beat. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as liquid, memory as seed) and payoff-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Strong verbs (“gnawed,” “trembling,” “clutched”) replace modifiers; sensory detail is selective and purposeful. Minor overwriting in “nested paradoxes, truths folded into themselves like origami”—a slight mixed vehicle—but not in peak beats. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are precise. Final line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “warm scent of yeast and cinnamon threading through the cold air like an unspoken promise” merges setting, character, and theme. One minor artifact: “heuristically gentle” risks label-speak but is redeemed by immediate behavioral proof (inviting softness). Final paragraph’s steam/birdcall/image avoids redundancy. No scaffold or loops; every sentence propels.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with high information density (“cathedral of ice,” “vow so potent it had outlasted the one who spoke it”). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though “quartz hush” risks abstraction before being grounded. One paraphrase loop: “illusions fading to memory, of truths slipping through fingers like frost” echoes later without added pressure. Final paragraph tightens rhythm effectively, but “gently meticulous” appears twice—redundant when once would suffice. No scaffold or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “rotting planks whispering secrets to the tide” establishes setting, mood, and theme in one image. Figurative language is purposeful, not excessive—metaphors align (silence as “blade,” market “pulsing”). Minor scaffold: “her breath steady despite…” and “despite the unease…” echo structurally, but not disruptively. Final paragraph’s cadence (“She’d captured… but she’d also heard…”) earns its lyricism through accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ribbons of violet and silver weaving,” “roots pulling free like reluctant dancers.” Figurative language serves causality—aurora as heartbeat foreshadows Elara’s quickened pulse. Minor overwriting in “terrestrially cosmic” risks jargon, but it’s quickly grounded in action. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence shift (long → short sentences) crystallizes tension without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “laughter slithered through the cracks of his charcoal-stained fingers like smoke” does triple duty (character, atmosphere, motif). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. Minor overwriting appears in the dream description (“canvas stretched taut over a wooden frame, its surface cracked with age”)—slightly redundant—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, filter-verb stacks, or scaffold; closure image (“charcoal-stained hands trembling”) recharges the opening motif with earned poignancy.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “glass domes fogged with the residue of a thousand failed purifiers” establishes tone, setting, and history in one breath. Figurative language is restrained and coherent (no mixed metaphors). Sentences vary in length and structure to match emotional cadence. One minor flaw: “her art had begun to wilt near dishonesty” slightly personifies art rather than showing Liora’s hand failing—but this is forgivable given its thematic payoff. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “The symphonies of truth were not played—they were *uncovered*” does thematic, character, and conceptual work in one line. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “blues and greens and a sliver of violet, the hues of wonder preserved in frozen water”—slightly redundant—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every image serves pressure or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “crimson edges curling like the lips of a sleeping god” does triple duty (image, mood, foreshadowing). Minor overwriting in one high-pressure beat (“storm of noise and memory, and then—silence”) slightly dulls propulsion, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates then resolves cleanly (“And that was enough”). Figurative coherence holds—static, fire, roses interweave without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “light spilled like honey” establishes tone, time, and texture in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances plot or character. Figurative language is controlled—“sandstorm calm” resonates without muddle. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in dialogue beats, but no artifacts obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “Her fingers traced the walls… to feel the faint vibrations” establishes action, motive, and setting). Figurative language is coherent: ocean as patient destroyer, dice as fate-cipher, dance as key. Minor density in mid-section (“poems disguised as equations…”) slightly slows momentum but pays off in closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line crystallizes all motifs without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “gleaming silence,” “pockets of gravity,” “scattered stars” all serve atmosphere and theme without overwriting. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and paragraph cuts heighten tension. Minor flaw: “crystal chambers humming beneath the wharf” slightly contradicts later “low, resonant thrum”—a small coherence slip in sonic texture. No loops or scaffolding; every line advances character, stakes, or mood. Final sentence’s cadence perfectly mirrors answering a call.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense, musical, and largely precise—sentences vary in length and structure, advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “tranquil blaze burned within him—not the kind that consumed, but the kind that illuminated without heat” edges into explanatory redundancy. A paraphrase-loop exists between “mapping silence” and “learned to listen to what was not said.” These don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+; artifacts are confined to mid-text, sparing the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic (“trails etching fleeting silver”), with strong verbs and concrete nouns. Minor overwriting in opening metaphor (“whisper of falling stars” slightly strained), but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence deepens resonance without redundancy. One near-paraphrase (“weight of the past… lifting into something new”) slightly dilutes propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “petals... absorbed sound like a thief” conveys setting, mood, and metaphor in one clause. Sentence openings vary (“He had come,” “Tonight,” “Then he saw”), and paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence.

No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “stalactites that wept slow, rhythmic tears” merges setting and emotion without purple excess. Syntax varies effectively—long, flowing sentences for memory; staccato for confrontation. One paraphrase loop: “unlinking herself from the past, from the girl…” slightly redundant. Figurative coherence holds except “shadow swallowing the light” verges on cliché, though redeemed by immediate tactile action (fingers curling around thorn).

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “stone paths coiled like frozen serpents” establishes setting, metaphor, and mood in one stroke. Figurative language is pattern-taught (serpents → webs → thread) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “universe hummed louder, no longer a secret, but a story” slightly blurs the concrete, but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is restrained and coherent (“breath curling into the dark,” “fragments like shards of glass”). No paraphrase loops, template cadence, or mixed metaphors. Final line (“Some wrecks were meant to stay buried”) recharges the opening wreck image with earned weight. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “she” openings in mid-section, but no artifact dulls closure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“clung like a mossy secret,” “fireflies flickering like embers”) is precise and non-repetitive. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully (e.g., participial openings for immersion, fragments for emphasis). Minor deduction: “scintillatingly somber” borders on elevated diction but is anchored by concrete context (post-rain air), avoiding register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful (“letters scattered like confetti,” “roots still pulsing with life”), with strong verbs and sensory specificity. Sentence variety supports momentum, and paragraphs shift length to mirror tension. One paraphrase loop: “The orchard wasn’t just surviving—it was healing” slightly echoes earlier phrasing about defiance. No filter-verb stacks or register drift, but the phrase “sharply observant instincts” borders on label-only—though quickly redeemed by action.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is potent but occasionally dense in high-pressure beats (e.g., “lightning splitting the sky like a blade” amid multiple metaphors). Minor scaffold in “his heart a storm of envy and longing”—emotion labeled rather than purely embodied. Otherwise, rhythm varies purposefully, and closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“fingers tracing edges of a forgotten music box” establishes tactile longing). Figurative language is precise and consistent—no mixed metaphors; all vehicles obey physical logic (melody “curls like smoke”). Minor flaw: slight overuse of em-dashes in middle section creates rhythmic sameness, but not enough to dull closure. Final paragraph’s cadence (“keeper of echoes… turned silence into song”) lands with earned lyricism, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “frost settled into their cracks” conveys age, cold, and fragility in five words. Figurative language is purposeful (“creaking like old bones”) and consistent. Minor overwriting in one beat (“vibrations attuned to the guilt…”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s clean syntax delivers closure without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information-per-line yield. Figurative language is purposeful (“jagged crown,” “moon paths,” “sculpt patience”) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in two adjacent lines (“He had tracked moon paths… to understand the rhythm… the way light bent…”) edges toward paraphrase-loop, costing 0.2. Otherwise, syntax varies naturally, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence, and the final line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “flashlight cutting through the gloom like a scalpel” merges function and metaphor cleanly. Minor artifact: “preventable death investigator” slightly stiff, but quickly grounded in action. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s cadence (“steady and sure”) echoes opening calm, creating rhythmic closure without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rain slicing through the air like a blade” merges image, rhythm, and stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors or overwriting—and each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor deduction for one near-paraphrase (“weight pressing against his ribs” / “coiled in his chest, tight and unyielding”), but no scaffold loops or cadence fatigue. Final paragraph’s drumbeat rhythm (“He would turn… And if the light…”) earns its crescendo without artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “acid sea below licked at its rusted underbelly” merges setting, threat, and metaphor without muddle. Sentence variety supports rhythm—longer clauses for reflection, staccato for urgency. Minor artifact: “steadily curious” feels slightly abstract amid otherwise concrete diction, but doesn’t dull closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean and evocative, with high information density (“life reduced to fragments, preserved but never truly remembered”). Sentence variety supports momentum, and metaphors (“digital graveyard,” “ghosts”) are consistent. One paraphrase loop weakens impact: “buried in the labyrinth of server logs” echoes “buried in the oldest layer” without added pressure. Figurative language remains coherent, though “haunting melody” borders on generic.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful: metaphors (“skeletal fingers,” “beam like a blade”) serve atmosphere and stakes. However, high-pressure beats occasionally over-embellish (“jagged teeth,” “unraveling like thread pulled too tight”), risking density overload. No paraphrase loops, but “calmly intuitive” repeats verbatim, creating a minor scaffold artifact. Final paragraph avoids purple prose, landing cleanly on the lighthouse beam—a strong closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “weight of endings pressing on his ribs,” “breath curling in the air like a question.” Figurative language is purposeful, not decorative—ice groans “like a living thing” only after human breath has been established as life’s marker. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“windborne solace”) that risks abstraction but is redeemed by context.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“rippling,” “swallowed,” “sinking”) and varied sentence openings. Figurative language is purposeful—the letter’s ink “bleeding into her skin like a confession”—without overwriting. One paraphrase loop: “heavy with the season’s last harvest” slightly echoes earlier “plump and waiting” grapes. Final paragraph’s “flawed, persistent, hers” risks label-speak but is redeemed by immediate sensory grounding (vines swaying, earth approving).

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “wooden slats groaning beneath his weight as if sharing secrets with the wind” merges setting, character, and theme in one breath. Figurative language is pattern-taught (whispers, echoes, threads) and pays off in the golden filament. Minor overwriting in “perfect circle of silence where the wind dared not enter”—slightly purple—but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances pressure or texture.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and selective sensory detail. Sentences vary in length and structure, creating a natural cadence that supports the meditative mood. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “woven into the very fabric of the place” and “transcended time”—slightly generic abstractions that dilute otherwise sharp imagery. No loops or scaffold, but two instances of near-redundant phrasing (“quiet satisfaction… chaos” / “collective healing… intertwined”) prevent a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line efficiency (e.g., “deciphering not words but the spaces between them” conveys character, theme, and method). Figurative language is purposeful—light “shattered” like the chandelier, shadows “dance” with crystal pulses—but avoids purple excess. Minor scaffold in “he had spent years… now he needed” slightly flattens momentum, and “fractured sequences” leans abstract. Still, rhythm varies skillfully, and the final line’s simplicity delivers resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield (“The hush of old videotapes left unwatched hung in the air, a static silence that made his skin prickle”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (fog “thick as memory,” time “refused to be pinned down”). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence, and the final image (“stepped forward”) earns its quiet power through accumulated texture. No register drift or filter-verb stacks dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically, paragraph cuts serve pressure shifts, and figurative language (“starlight pooled,” “dying breath” of stabilizers) remains coherent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One slight overwriting beat: “a streak of light so bright it burned through the paper” edges toward purple but pays off in tactile tracing (“feeling the heat”). Closure image remains unblurred by artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “warm, pulsing stillness,” “decisively kind,” “jagged and incomplete, but it still held music.” Sentences vary in length and structure; paragraphs breathe with emotional beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent—light “pulses,” hope has “scent,” silence “hums.” Minor deduction for one slightly over-ornamented phrase (“mound of pillows”) but no artifacts dull closure. Read-aloud rhythm supports the hymnal tone without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and economical: “spoons twisting like serpents,” “reflections spilling out like ink into water.” Sentences vary in length and structure; paragraph cuts serve rhythm and revelation. Minor density issue: “latent energy, a remnant of the time after spoons bent reality…” slightly over-explains, but quickly grounds in sensory detail (ozone, old metal). No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; high information density in key beats. Closure image is clear, resonant, and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“a smile too old for its face” conveys character, stakes, and uncanniness) and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting in one high-pressure beat (“glowed faintly, like a star trapped in enamel”) borders on purple but pays off later with the “tiny sun” tooth. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line (“good at finding things”) perfectly echoes the opening, creating closure through resonance, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “The grotto exhaled mist like a sleeping dragon” establishes voice and atmosphere in one stroke. Figurative language is controlled—sea glass “scattering fractured hues,” memories “clawing their way back”—without muddle or overwriting. Minor scaffold in “she had found it years ago... back when...” could tighten, but no loops or artifacts dull the closure beat. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic resolution: short, declarative, luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “server racks draped in ivy like the ribs of some slumbering beast” merges setting, metaphor, and mood. Figurative language is pattern-taught (amber veins ≈ leaf veins ≈ icicle lace) and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (mist as “living thing,” hopes as “shapes,” pages turning as ripples) without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “emerald arches trembling,” “leaves unfurling like tiny green hands.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (light fracturing, spirals) and pays off at closure.

Final line (“first notes... trembling on her lips”) perfectly echoes opening cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence multitasks (e.g., “His fingers… traced the edges” conveys character, action, and backstory). Figurative language is coherent—silence “pressing like snow,” movements “like a spider spins”—without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful (e.g., breaking before “He took a sheet…” to heighten ritual focus). Final line (“hold the breath of the world and let it go”) resonates with opening’s “world held its breath,” closing the cadence loop with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“calloused fingers,” “liquid gold,” “broken heart” of timer). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/reflection motifs) and pays off in climax. Minor redundancy in “fogging in the chill air” after “breath” slightly dulls immediacy, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly modulates closure’s quiet intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“boundary-lessly trapped,” “shingled hush”) that slightly strains metaphor coherence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Final paragraph’s shift from “whisper” to “song” delivers perfect propulsion. Minor deduction for two adjacent high-density figurative lines (“shadows stretched boundary-lessly trapped…”) that momentarily blur physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “steam curling like a ghost testing the edges” does atmosphere, character, and metaphor in one. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One minor overwriting risk (“drowning dancers” for tea leaves borders on purple), but it’s earned by the tactile precision elsewhere.

Final paragraph’s cadence shift (“And so she would keep…”) delivers earned stasis without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: “gilded towers swaying gently on chains thicker than ancient oaks” establishes scale, decay, and fragility in one breath.

Closure image (“branches swaying like dancers”) avoids cliché through specificity (“permanent moonlight”) and emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and theme (“porcelain smile” split by cry, ink bleeding “like a confession”). Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (mercury-pooled time, bone-clean fracture). Minor overwriting in “slow breath of cumulus” slightly blurs physical logic, but closure remains sharp. Final line’s cadence crystallizes stakes without scaffold, earning high-band status despite one hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “hull patched with scavenged plating,” “shadows peeled back like skin.” Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances character, setting, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (stitching = memory integration; gravity = emotional weight). Final line (“The work was done”) resonates without overstatement. Minor deduction for one slightly stacked modifier (“liquid starlight said to hold...”), but clarity at closure is pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“His pockets were empty… yet unable to stop”) and rhythmic variation. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light = meaning) and pays off in the bug’s extinction. Minor scaffold in “the texture of transformation wasn’t something you could hold—it was something you became” edges toward abstraction but is redeemed by immediate action (“He ran”). No loops or register drift; closure beat is artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“walls… pulsed faintly like a dying heartbeat”). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (light/shadow/spark motifs never contradict). No loops or scaffold; varied syntax propels momentum. Minor deduction: “winking hush of a thing” slightly strains metaphor, but doesn’t blur sense. Final line’s cadence (“Somewhere, a lock clicked open…”) masterfully echoes opening rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “slippery bodies darting between his fingers like living shadows” does triple duty (character, setting, motif). Minor overwriting in aurora description (“half-remembered dream”) slightly dilutes urgency, but figurative coherence holds. Zero loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s cadence (“wind tugged... sand clung... eels slipped”) perfectly echoes opening. Closure image sharp, unblurred by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“rain lashing the observatory’s glass like a thousand desperate fingers”). Figurative language is coherent—scars as rivers/mountains, timer as accuser—and avoids purple excess. Minor overwriting in “furiously tranquil” risks abstraction but is anchored by immediate context. No paraphrase loops, scaffold sentences, or syntactic monotony; rhythm varies naturally to mirror storm and stillness. Final line (“full of things he could not yet name”) resonates without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose balances density and propulsion: “brass fingers whirring softly” conveys character, setting, and emotion in six words. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, minimal modifiers—and sentence rhythms mirror mechanical/organic duality. One minor slip: “dignified chaos” slightly abstracts tone, but it’s redeemed by immediate sensory grounding (“glass walls amplified the brook’s murmur”). No loops or scaffolding bloat key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “fingers tracing the coffee tin tucked into his coat” establishes action, object, and concealment). Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (library as body, resistance as botany). Final paragraph’s cadence (“picked up another book… The resistance had begun”) accelerates subtly without sacrificing clarity. Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“skeletal ribs”) that risks purple prose but pays off in closure’s rebirth imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: metaphors (“music drifting like smoke”) serve atmosphere without muddling causality. High information density—each sentence advances character, setting, or pressure. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “waves dark as spilled ink” (familiar simile) and one paraphrase loop (“fragile bridge between sky and sea” / “bridge between the sky and the sea” implied later). No scaffold sentences; rhythm varies effectively to mirror musical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but precise: “blossoms’ glow seeped into her skin,” “vine curling around her wrist like a bracelet.” Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. Minor overwriting in dream sequence (“bridge of light that led nowhere”) edges toward abstraction, but sap-ink and parchment leaves ground the magic. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors resolve without flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is controlled—“tides of remembrance,” “cerulean regret”—and coheres without muddle. Minor overwriting in “rhythmically placid cadence” (adverb + noun redundancy), but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates subtly toward “smiled,” then resolves with lyrical closure. Read-aloud ear test passes; varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths create breath.
