  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most lines do double work linking setting, memory, and theme). Figurative language (dust as time's archive, neutron stars as grief analogue) remains coherent and voice-motivated. Minor loop: "Dust accumulated everywhere—in greenhouse corners, in the spaces between galaxies, in the crevices of human hearts where grief settled and slowly transformed" borders on thematic restatement after prior dust motifs, though the tricolon structure charges the closure approach. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Syntax varies; sentence openings shift across paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops diminish momentum: "beauty existed independent of those transactions" is restated as "beauty's survival despite the hands that tried to own it"; "someone steadily adaptive" echoes the earlier attribute declaration. The phrase "scorched testament" appears three times with slight variations but without clear escalation of meaning. Figurative density is high throughout ("stars...their resonance drifted through her still, harmonizing") without always serving pressure. Template cadence appears in several "She [verb]" constructions. Information density is generally strong but scaffold phrases like "the space where transformation happened" read abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and figurative language ("silence lived here naturally, without violence," "orchestra...played on in colors") is coherent and purpose-driven. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor density issue: "She understood only that silence lived here naturally, without violence" and the later paragraph "true silence now, comfortable as a familiar room" restate comfort-with-silence across two beats without added pressure—borderline loop (−0.2). Filter-verb stack in paragraph four ("had discovered," "had found," "had ever encountered") slightly dulls immediacy but remains voice-motivated. Strong opening and closing lines anchor stakes and image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies well, and information density is high across most beats. Opening hooks with the kelp-wrapped package, and the final image recycles the lens with reweighted meaning. Line-level clarity is strong, though minor overwriting appears: "impossible spaces between the shelves where geometry bent like grief" stacks metaphor, and "the drowned had found their rest" + "refused to abandon broken things" in the final paragraph create slight synonym drift. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The "not X, exactly, but not Y either" construction recurs ("not ghosts, exactly" / "dreams or death or something between"), a modest tic that doesn't obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied; opening sentence establishes voice and stakes efficiently. Information density is solid (most lines do character, world, or pressure work). However, the piece carries noticeable paraphrase loops: "the purpose of the midnight food runs—not merely distribution, but communion" is immediately restated by "Mira had designed it this way…hunger shared created bonds that lectures could not." The final paragraph stacks three synonym phrases for continuation ("run again," "learn from the old," "continue its patient work") without added pressure. Filter-verb reliance is moderate but present ("she understood," "she had learned"). No major artifact obscures closure, so penalties remain within-band.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several lines loop: "spiritually curious observation" appears twice, "unused love" recurs without fresh pressure, and the final paragraph stacks summary ("she would continue," "Kwan Yin's Tear had been lost," "some answers only become visible"). Template cadence in the closing: "She was [noun]…She was [noun]…She was [noun]" across three beats. Mixed metaphor: "sparks from an unseen fire" when sparks *are* fire. Stock phrasing: "invisible geography of human longing." Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems, −0.3 for mixed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and individual sentences are generally clear, but the piece carries noticeable template artifacts. Repeated "She had" stems open multiple paragraphs; "neither X nor Y" constructions appear three times in exposition ("neither glass nor metal," "not a river or a line," "not a prison but a garden"). The monastery backstory and photograph-fading passages feel like parallel exposition blocks that slow momentum before the garden sequence begins. Information density is high in the bridge convergence, but earlier beats recirculate the retrocognitive concept without advancing pressure. No major loops obscure causality, keeping this in mid-7s rather than lower.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing image recharges the chains motif with new weight. Figurative language is controlled ("keys yellowed like old teeth," "held breath finally released") and serves pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor artifact: "staggering grace she didn't feel" is a weak filter, and "war behind his face" + "finger hovered near the trigger" are stock gestures, but these don't touch closure. High clarity and momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance setting, character, or theme simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (cathedral of moss, sonic fossils, fault lines) is coherent and voice-motivated. The opening paragraph anchors efficiently. However, the phrase "her battered marvel of a workshop" near the end reads slightly stock, and "the way all true things do" in paragraph nine feels like unnecessary scaffolding. The reflection on memories having "weight, had texture" walks the line between concrete and abstract but stays legible. No loops or paraphrase cycles detected, though a couple of constructions could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished with strong sensory detail ("jade-tiled walls catching amber rays," "night-blooming jasmine") and varied syntax. However, several passages loop or over-explain: "illuminated moments" appears five times, often as decorative recurrence rather than causal pressure. The phrase "Some thefts were not crimes but corrections" directly restates the premise established in paragraph two. Template phrasing like "She had learned to reinterpret" and "She understood that kind of waiting" stacks filter verbs in adjacent lines. These artifacts dull momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in action beats; backstory blocks are less propulsive. One paraphrase loop near the bookmark introduction: "cracked leather" and "split but not separated" restate durability without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in self-narration stems ("the glassblower examines," "the thoughtfully spirited protagonist") recurs three times but reads voice-motivated, not artifact (no deduction). Minor filter-verb stacks ("felt the ice beginning," "heard the thunder") in reflective beats do not dull immediacy. No mixed metaphors. Clarity and momentum are strong; strategic telling compresses seventeen years efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several scaffolding constructions dilute propulsion: "The betrayal wasn't just personal—it was transformative" and "She'd spent her career hiding vulnerability, but now she understood its power" explain rather than show. The metaphor "confession spilling like rust from corroded metal" attempts to integrate setting but mixes vehicle (liquid vs. particulate corrosion). Paraphrase loop in paragraph three: "coordinates and dates" becomes "proof of who she really was—and evidence." The opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively, but the final paragraph summarizes emotional payoff rather than landing on a charged image. No major loops or template cadence, but clarity occasionally stalls on explanatory asides.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance character, image, or pressure. Figurative language is controlled: "ambered hush," "marbled hush," "time thickening like honey." Minor loop: "the darkness" and "the void" are near-synonyms across several sentences in the middle third without added pressure. "Borrowed light" at the end is slightly incongruous—where is the light borrowed from if all stars are extinguished? This touches the closure image but doesn't obscure causality. No scaffolding or template cadence. Clarity and concision are strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and image precision: "Snow fell in slow spirals past the crystalline pillars, each flake another thought the robot janitor could not quite trace to its origin." Information density is high, with most sentences advancing character, atmosphere, or concept. Some near-paraphrase appears ("The loops had made it necessary" / "the seeking could end" / "had found peace") that slightly dulls momentum in the resolution sequence. Minor filter-verb reliance ("recognized," "understood") in middle passages, though not concentrated enough to trigger the stacked-filter penalty. No major loops or template cadence; figurative language remains coherent and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clarity and momentum are mostly strong, but several loops and scaffold sentences dilute density. "The crystal walls caught their exchange and whispered it back in fractured harmonics, spreading the moment through the forecourt like ripples in still water" stacks metaphors without adding pressure. "Something shifted between them" is abstract summary. The final paragraph contains two paraphrase loops: "freed by honesty that needed no words" echoes "honesty in her contradictions," and "some beginnings required no registration at all—only presence" restates the prior beat. These loops touch the closure paragraph, so the penalty escalates: −1.2 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact rule. Template cadence is not present, but the stacked figurative language in the closure beat ("crystal catching starlight and rain," "resonant hush," "space where mistrust once lived") feels ornamental rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is mostly clean and propulsive with strong imagery ("clouded with age and split down one side like a wounded thing"). Information density is high—each paragraph advances character, world, or theme. Two minor issues: the phrase "blooming and withering in the same moment, leaves falling while new buds formed beneath them" borders on overwrought in a single beat, mixing metaphor density without full clarity; and "mended deception" as a term is repeated (title + text) without the second use adding pressure. No paraphrase loops, syntax varies purposefully, and the final line ("That was enough. That had always been enough.") closes with earned simplicity. Slight overwriting in one mid-story passage keeps this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is selective ("docking arms stretched like the legs of a sleeping spider," "Time wasn't a river. It was an ocean"). Information density is high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or conflict. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the mechanically warm vibration" recurs three times across the piece, and "subdued awakening" / "quiet" / "soft and certain" cluster in the final paragraphs, creating synonym churn around the tonal thesis. The phrase "obliging sky mechanic" feels slightly anachronistic for the POV's self-conception. No major clarity issues, but the repetitive "icy warmth" / "mechanically warm" pattern in peak beats triggers minor line-level drag.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and sentence structure supports atmosphere well. Information density is high; most lines advance character or plot. Minor scaffold appears: "She understood now" and "She had spent her life invisible" are slightly tell-heavy where action could show. The phrase "dead notes" in paragraph one and "dead forty years" in the next creates inadvertent echo. Figurative language ("music was born but never seen," "chord finally struck after forty years of silence") enriches texture but occasionally stacks without advancing pressure. No major loops or clarity issues; prose is clean and propulsive overall.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Opening and closing images are strong. Two minor artifacts: "borrowed by" should be "borne by" in the auroral sorrow line (likely a homophone slip), and "swaying now, tilting" is a near-paraphrase within one sentence. Template cadence appears briefly in the reflection paragraphs ("She had seen... Seen the towers... And she had swallowed") but does not obscure causality. No loops touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (each beat advances discovery or understanding). Clarity remains strong through complex revelation. Minor deductions: "that peculiar drowsy alertness of three in the morning" is somewhat abstract for a professional explorer's perception; "the tunnel seemed to hold its breath" and "that hush that follows a sudden confession" create light metaphoric stacking in adjacent paragraphs; "religious skeptical" and later "skeptics like himself" repeat the concept without added pressure. The final sequence avoids loops and propels cleanly. No pronoun drift or spatial confusion. Overallcraft is strong with small texture redundancies that don't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, figurative language is coherent and vivid ("roots threaded through collapsed shelves," "the way light filtered through cracks"), and information density is high in descriptive passages. However, the piece loops conceptually: lines 3–5 in the opening and multiple mid-story paragraphs paraphrase the same thematic assertion (silence = accumulation, decay = growth) without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph ("She witnessed. She burrowed... She let reality slip...") with repetitive "She [verb]" stems across three sentences. Baseline −0.6 for paraphrase loop and template run; no artifact touches closure directly, so high-band entry remains possible but not achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in peak beats (the locket transfer, the corona moment). However, three issues accumulate: (1) paraphrase loops ("ordinary magic" / "ordinary extraordinary," "dreaming roots" recurs four times without fresh detail), (2) minor register drift into elevated diction ("biblical," "photosynthetic dreams") that strains Elena's voice, and (3) the closing three paragraphs loop thematically without advancing pressure. Clarity and momentum are strong until the denouement, which recaps rather than propels.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is largely clean with purposeful rhythm: "The silo library stood in bronze quiet" anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Information density is high—each paragraph advances discovery or world-logic. However, mild scaffold appears: "She descended to the lower levels, following the silo's memory like a thread through a labyrinth" restates pursuit already implied. "The tapestry fragment was smaller than her forearm" is precise, but "the particular bronze of ancient gold thread" repeats "bronze" from the opening without reweighting. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but some lines lean expository: "The displaced axis wasn't a consequence of the Silence—it was the cause" tells rather than dramatizing the realization. Final image "In the bronze quiet of a world without dreams, Maren carried the weight of an axis waiting to be restored" effectively recharges the opening motif.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: most lines do double duty (fortunes illustrate prophecy and advance the journalist setup). Clarity is strong except for two friction points: "directing flow" and "orchestrate meaning" are repeated near-synonyms that loop without added pressure (−0.3). The final paragraph's "accidentally prophetic, each one a small act of orchestration" restates the thesis already established, creating minor scaffold (−0.2). No mixed metaphors or template cadence runs. Grammar and tense are clean. The prose is serviceable but not lyric; no standout propulsion or figurative control in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings shift appropriately. Information density is generally high (palette, loop pedal, dimensional anchor all do double duty). However, several lines loop conceptually: "unraveled stillness" appears three times with minimal reweighting until the final paragraph, and "What if..." questions stack without advancing new pressure mid-scene. "Muffled yet strangely clear" and "decorates with silence" are striking but risk becoming tics. Minor filter-verb stack: "told you," "assumed," "said" cluster without embodied anchoring in one mid-beat. No catastrophic artifacts, but density dips slightly in the final two paragraphs where summary encroaches.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm is controlled and imagery vivid, but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "sky that seemed to fold into itself," "Dawn spilled...like honey," "exhaustion...settling into her bones like snow," "frequencies that slipped between heartbeats" all appear in quick succession. Stock metaphors ("door opening to a room," "echoes of echoes") and elevated diction ("upturned hush," "accumulated silence") cluster in the final third, reducing specificity under pressure. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the prose leans toward lyricism at the expense of momentum. The final fortune itself is strong, but surrounding lines over-articulate the thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully with lyric compression fitting the Accumulative mode. Information density is high: most lines advance image, character state, or thematic pattern. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The runes shifted again" / "runes settled into a final configuration, though she knew they would shift again" restates pattern without added pressure. Stock metaphors cluster in the final third: "dandelion seeds in a hurricane," "lightning finding water," "helix of possibility." These reduce specificity in peak beats and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty. No scaffold or generation tokens present.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is generally high. However, several lines carry overwriting: "silence she could feel against her palms," "invisible architecture of sound," "filament of hush threaded through her like light through water" stack metaphor without advancing pressure. The phrase "the mirrored hush of the cavern reflected her grief back at her, transformed" is abstract and conceptually muddled. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 12–13 restate the backward-rhythm concept without new detail.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is often sharp ("curled tight as a sleeping moth," "stars pricked through the haze"), but several passages carry paraphrase loops and template cadence. The reflection on integrity ("not a single grand gesture but a thousand small choices") is restated through "gathering quietly before they broke the silence open," and the courtyard's peace is described twice in adjacent paragraphs ("courtyard held its breath" / "courtyard held its peace"). Filter-verb stacks in the opening third ("had walked," "had followed," "had recorded," "had become," "had learned") dull immediacy during setup. The phrase "someone who understood that answers rarely came directly" tells what "credibly curious" should show. Line-level propulsion is adequate but not exceptional; the piece could lose ~100 words of reflective summary without harming the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is specific ("currency dissolved into irrelevance," "impossible sweetness of uncaged breath"). Information density is high, with most lines doing double work. Minor issues: "accumulated presence" and "texture of time" recur without reweighting, edging toward thematic echo. The final paragraph's "choice by impossible choice" reads as summative scaffold rather than propulsion. No major loops or artifacts, but the prose does not tighten under pressure in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most lines advance setting, character, or theme). "The chronic hush seemed to absorb it, to pull the notes down into the waterlogged earth before they could fully form" delivers sensory specificity with momentum. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor template cadence in the family-tradition paragraph: "Someone would interrupt… or the fire would demand… or a child would fall asleep" uses parallel structure but remains voice-motivated and legible. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. The final image—copper bowl glowing "like an ember"—recharges the survival motif without overwriting. Proofreading is clean; no ambiguous pronouns or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied; opening line "held the dying light like honey holds time" is arresting. Information density is high in most beats. Overwriting cluster mid-story: "fractured it into a thousand burning fragments," "residual emotions that clung to this place like perfume to skin," "something heartbreaking beneath"—three figurative moves in quick succession without pattern-teaching, pushing density without always advancing pressure (−0.4). Minor scaffold: "She had sought this out, hadn't she?" is rhetorical filler. "The transformation was completing now, she could sense it" and later "The transformation completed itself" loop the concept across paragraphs (−0.3). No loops touch closure beat directly; final image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clarity is high; no spatial or temporal confusion. Information density is good in the archive and Elias beats. However, the final two paragraphs loop thematically: "the cycle continued" is restated via "passing it forward," "inherited, communal, eternal," and the stars/harbor/library reprise. The ceremony paragraph summarizes fifteen families and the unveiling without scene pressure. Sentence openings vary; no filter-verb stacks. Minor scaffold ("her considerable influence") and a paraphrase loop in the ending dock the score within the 6–7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled with vivid imagery ("black as grief, bright as hope, its volcanic surface threaded with veins of captured starlight"). Information density is high in the opening; later beats become more leisurely. Paraphrase loop detected: "The search became ritual, then tradition, then something that felt sacred without needing a name" cycles through near-synonyms without added pressure (−0.2). The final paragraph stacks abstract terms ("luminescent with ache...luminescent also with...insistence") that edge toward rhetorical flourish. A few template stems appear ("She had come...She had been...She had wandered") but remain voice-consistent. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Information density is high—most lines advance character understanding or world detail. Two minor paraphrase touches: "Not breaking but completing, becoming the silence they had always been meant to become" restates the dissolution concept; "seeking their origins" echoes "return to its source" from two paragraphs prior. Figurative language is controlled and voice-appropriate ("silver threads stitched through the sky," "wet clay," "trapped birds"). Opening line anchors stakes and voice; final line recharges the cadence motif with image rather than summary. No scaffold or pronoun drift. One weak nominalization: "a yearning she had never named" could be sharper, but the phrase serves character hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and the opening/closing images are strong, but several passages lean into decorative phrasing that slows momentum without adding pressure. "She believed—had to believe—that emotion operated by similar hidden formulas" and "The mathematics of emotion wasn't about locating the lost. It was about mapping the shape loss carved in the one who stayed" read as thesis statements rather than discoveries. Minor template cadence in the middle third: "She placed... She traced... The equations began..." The final third tightens well, but the piece carries ~15% more explanatory scaffold than needed, particularly around the mathematics conceit. No loops or fatal artifacts, and figurative language is generally controlled, but density could be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening image ("shadows pooling between shelves like spilled ink") anchors voice effectively. Information density is generally high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or stakes. However, several paraphrase loops and thematic restatements dilute propulsion: "invisible did not mean absent, and absence did not mean without power" is immediately followed by similar constructions in subsequent paragraphs, and the final three paragraphs recycle the visibility/invisibility binary without adding new pressure. The phrase "kindly methodical" appears twice in identical form. Minor template cadence appears in the repeated "She had..." and "Maren..." sentence openings across the middle third. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but cumulative scaffold reduces line-level density slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; short paragraphs at closure accelerate pressure. Information density is high in body-change beats (bark patches, photosynthesis, visible veins). Figurative language is controlled and botanically motivated. Two slips lower the score: "circuitously sincere, wrapping around the question she really meant" is a mini-exposition loop that restates rather than advances; "letting the rain wash away her old boundaries" is abstractly metaphorical where a concrete image would land harder. Sentence openings vary. No major scaffold or paraphrase loops. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is mostly clean and propulsive, with vivid images (causeway as spine, seaweed veils, amber brooch). Minor scaffold appears in repeated convergence vocabulary and template stems ("She painted," "She walked," "She turned"). The phrase "haggard awe" recurs three times, risking synonym loop. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent, though "bruise of stone and ruin" and "spine emerging from grey flesh" stack metaphors in adjacent beats. No major loops or clarity breaks, but pervasive "convergence" vocabulary and parallel sentence openings reduce momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with compressed urgency ("The shadows surged") and lyric expansion ("A child laughing at a butterfly. An old man tasting his grandmother's soup recipe"). Information density is high; most lines advance image, stakes, or theme. Minor scaffolding: "After the pilgrim arrives, the old stories said" feels like a structural patch rather than organic pressure, and "She had been a clairvoyant for thirty years" front-loads backstory efficiently but slightly expositionally. One paraphrase slip: "beautiful and treacherous, bright in its luminescence yet dark in its depths" restates the oxymoron without added pressure. Figurative language ("moonlight condensed into solid form") is vivid and controlled. Overall clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity and momentum are mostly strong, but reflective scaffolding accumulates: "She had learned long ago that navigated absences…" and "The harbor recovered slowly, its wounds healing in the same staggered intervals…" restate thematic content without advancing action. Paraphrase loop between "She could not change what had been lost" and "the lost were not forgotten" in consecutive lines (−0.2). Template cadence in the family-visit paragraph: "One widow wept… A father finally stopped…" (−0.4). Metaphor "patient as salt" is fresh, but "ever-growing map of what absence could teach" tilts abstract. Information density is high in the valve-repair beat; other passages summarize rather than dramatize.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "mist curled like breath from sleeping giants," "cracks spider across stone," "trembling certainty." In the final paragraph, three consecutive metaphors ("landscape of secrets," "geography of a family," "cartography of reconciliation") stack without breathing room, creating texture overload that dulls propulsion. The phrase "analytically artistic precision" and "trembling certainty" are evocative but border on oxymoron without grounding action to anchor the contradiction. No loops or scaffold, and the opening/closing lines frame well, but the metaphor density at closure slightly obscures the emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies appropriately; no template cadence. Clarity is generally strong. However, mild overwriting in descriptors: "ancient tower," "eternal patterns," "gentle purpose" stack high-register adjectives without fresh specificity. "Courageously kind" is abstract label-speak. Paraphrase loop: "She remained a skeptic—but now she was a skeptic who had heard whales sing" restates the same idea across two beats. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she realized," "she thought") cluster in the second half without voice-driven necessity. No major loops or artifacts touch the closure image, so penalties remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create visual and sonic texture ("The solar storm began on what she calculated was a Tuesday"). Information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Grammar and pronoun references are clean. Figurative language ("dimensions folded like origami," "hushed thunder") is vivid and coherent, though "hushed thunder" borders on oxymoron without clear resolution. One minor scaffold: "And for the first time in forever, she wasn't bored" repeats the boredom motif stated two sentences earlier, but the effect is closure-charging rather than redundant, so no deduction applied.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean with varied rhythm and high information density. Opening anchors stakes and voice efficiently. The ink pot's description does double duty (physical object and thematic weight). Two minor issues: "that particular expression she had seen on immigration lawyers, on border agents" is a small list that could be tighter, and "liquefies rigid thinking" in the penultimate section reads slightly abstract/prompt-adjacent. No loops or scaffold; clarity and propulsion are strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished with strong specificity ("58.3 Hz - tastes of ash and wedding cake," "heavy stock, flecked with minerals that caught light like trapped stars"). Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high without padding. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting in the opening's stacked metaphors ("shield against forgetting," "dust of decades," "times that never existed" in quick succession) and a slight register drift into abstract philosophizing ("time was not a line but a fabric") that, while voice-consistent, edges toward telling. The closure image is concrete and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density is high: "She had no name anymore, not since the hospital issued a death certificate with her photograph and someone else's cause of death" anchors who, what, and stakes in one beat. Figurative language ("breathing with the rhythm of tides," "sediment," "bureaucratic acid") is controlled and purposeful, not stacked. Clarity is excellent; spatial choreography and action order track cleanly. Minor deduction: "filtering reality" and "filtered reality" recur in the final paragraph, edging toward a conceptual loop, but the cost at closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high at key beats (the cello scene, the final descent). However, patterned artifacts accumulate: "She had never..." appears twice in close proximity, and several figurative constructions stack without clear payoff ("perched...like a forgotten thought," "smoke," "cupped hands," "ache between one breath and the next"). The phrase "reimagines past conversations constantly" appears as naked exposition mid-story, a filter-verb summary that tells rather than shows the habit. The painted seashell's warmth and the cello's hum both serve as convenient triggers rather than causally prepared sensory shifts. Proofreading is clean, and no loops or synonym churn appear, but the metaphor density in reflective passages edges toward overwriting without tonal variation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, setting, or pressure. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The carnival continued... lights reflecting" restates mood already established, and "kept spinning, kept floating, kept refusing to sink" cycles synonyms without added pressure. Minor filter-verb stacks ("could sense," "watched," "noticed") in early beats slightly dull immediacy. The final paragraph's repetitive "kept [verb]" construction borders on template cadence but serves emphasis. Grammar and tense are clean; no pronoun ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no algorithmic patterns. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. However, some scaffold persists: "The space age continued its relentless expansion above her" restates what the satellite already showed. "It was enough. It would have to be enough" is near-paraphrase loop. The chemical-packet countdown creates propulsion. Figurative language is controlled but occasionally stacks: "fallen constellations," "bleeding upward," "daily drowning" cluster densely. No major opacity or clarity breaks. Proofreading is clean. Opening and closing lines are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. Clarity is maintained throughout. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "She was blind, had been since the accident that took her sight but sharpened everything else" recaps information implied by "listening to the world speak in frequencies"; "She smiled and returned to her repair shop, where other broken things waited to be understood" echoes the opening's established pattern without fresh pressure. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("damage," "messages," "darkness and light," "fractures") that feel like scaffold rather than earned closure language. Minor template cadence in sensory beats ("She felt X, she heard Y") across multiple paragraphs. Deduction −0.6 for loops and scaffold touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph structure breathes. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "rivers had origins you could stand in" delivers motive, metaphor, and stakes simultaneously). Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled and coherent: condensation-on-glass, ice groaning "its ancient vocabulary," breath as "small temporary clouds" all serve the accumulative water/memory pattern. One minor register lift: "subtly confident resolve" in the penultimate paragraph reads slightly elevated for the moment's urgency, but does not obscure the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm, and figurative language (seed falling, buildings folding "like a seed falls") serves the closure image. Information density is high in the ritual beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She was infinitely patient. She had to be" restates without adding pressure; "the wild hush that had settled over everything, the breathless quiet that precedes transformation" offers synonym churn. "Ghost town revival was already beginning, had been beginning" loops conceptually. The final paragraph's compression (ninety years in two sentences) reads efficient, but the cumulative scaffold artifacts lower the score by approximately −0.6.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely clean with strong rhythm control and varied sentence structure. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "lonesome splendor" conveys both beauty and isolation). Minor scaffolding appears in expository middle section: "according to her research" feels inserted. The phrase "gathered hush" recurs five times, mostly purposeful but borders on over-reliance. No major loops or template cadence; figurative language is coherent and supports rather than obscures.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally propulsive. Strong images: "silence like skin," "words evaporating from his tongue," "copperlight…like absolution." However, several template stems and near-loops appear: "The copperlight of dusk filtered… / The copperlight seemed to thicken… / letting the copperlight settle" recycles the motif without adding pressure each time. "Chasing hush" is repeated verbatim across father's letter and narration. Minor filter-verb stack in the confessional entrance ("could see scratches"). The closure image is clean, but the mid-section carries scaffold phrasing ("yes, but also," "or rather") that slows momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("cathedral of glass and iron bones," "veil drifting upward like smoke, like prayer, like a bride"), but density flags in the middle third with near-paraphrase loops ("The ashen-veil ghost bride had haunted his bloodline for a century" closely echoes prior exposition). Template cadence appears in the backstory block ("had been Maren once... had stood... had succeeded... had been"). The closure beat is clean, but overwriting in earlier passages (stacked metaphors, elevated diction) slows momentum before the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with strong imagery and rhythm variation. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Minor pattern detected: "Her grandmother/mother/[Meren]" parallel structure in paragraph two reads slightly templated but teaches the generational pattern. One filter-verb cluster in the opening paragraph ("had been carved," "still reached") appropriate for establishing deep time. "Orchid solace" as phrase feels slightly ornamental, though it's anchored to the final image. No loops or clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with varied rhythm and strong imagery. Minor loop detected: "She had come to excavate a tomb" (paragraph 4) echoes "The tomb she had come to excavate" (near end), rephrasing the same content without added pressure. Template cadence in the rebuilding sequence: "She began to rebuild. Through purposeful wandering, she gathered… She found… When she placed…" uses parallel stems across four sentences without taught pattern. Information density is high in sensory beats but thins during the week-long excavation summary.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in world-building passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "surface mail had outlived every prediction of its demise" followed immediately by elaboration on quantum vs. physical transit without new pressure; "The name came to her as she wrote: Elena Marginal" is then explained rather than advanced. Minor template cadence in the chalk-decoding sequence ("Pink spiral: ... Three green dots: ... Yellow crossing blue:"). No major artifacts touch closure, but the non-closure scaffold warrants a −0.6 deduction in Q7. Clarity and propulsion are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence runs. Information density is high—most lines advance character, conspiracy, or atmosphere. Minor loop: "The flame flickered twice, and Mira understood" followed immediately by rising and gathering creates a slight redundancy in the transition beat. "Echoed silence" and "spiral" recur across the piece, but the pattern is voice-consistent rather than artifactual. One filter-verb cluster in the opening paragraph ("having passed," "whispering that") is acceptable in exposition. Figurative language is controlled and apt ("copper coins thrown to fate").

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual texture. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The gargoyle shard grew warm against her thigh" signals object, sensation, and impending revelation). Clarity and propulsion are strong through the climax. Minor loop: "the spirits' song" recurs frequently without always adding new pressure. A few elevated phrases ("those stone guardians who watched over their family for generations") approach light exposition but remain voice-plausible. No template cadence, no metaphor muddle. Overall very strong line-level control with hairline redundancies that do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; the opening grounds atmosphere and stakes efficiently. The coral motif's layered deployment (Pacific conflict, salvaged fragment, bleaching, kept anyway, closure decision) does multiple jobs. Minor deductions: "tanched together like fishing nets" (likely "tangled") reads as a typo or neologism without clear voice motivation; the phrase "lotus-hearted ache" in the final line mixes registers (elevated poetic + embodied) and slightly muddles the closure image's clarity. No paraphrase loops or template cadence present; propulsion is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, several passages loop conceptually: "joy was not a destination but a practice" is restated as "recovered through devotion to one's craft" within two sentences; "the daydream began to release her" is followed by "softening into the approaching dawn of waking consciousness," a paraphrase. The phrase "specialized tools that projected luminescence onto surfaces, leaving traces that glowed in darkness" could compress to "light-projection tools" without clarity loss. These scaffold moments do not touch the closure beat directly but accumulate to −0.6 within Q7 under the paraphrase-loop and density checks.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances knowledge or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual progression. However, minor loops appear: "waited for the next curious soul to stand in the pause, to offer uncertainty as a key, to awaken inside the awakening" stacks three parallel infinitives that paraphrase the same concept. "She had asked a question. And in the pause between question and reply" briefly restates. The final paragraph's triple "seeing themselves seeing themselves seeing" is purposeful pattern rather than artifact. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats. Figurative language (horn-shaped skylights, folk-art grin) remains coherent and sparse enough to avoid density penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character or world. Paraphrase loop at "You're candidly cryptic" / "You told me...but not why...but smiled" restates without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the "By spring...By summer...By fall" triplet functions as intentional parallelism, so no penalty. Stock metaphor "morning glories opening" and "virus of hope" are functional but lack fresh specificity. Figurative density in the insect descriptions ("chorus of tiny conspirators," "moths stirred") works without muddle. Minor scaffold ("Everything was converging now") tells rather than shows convergence. Solid craft with modest line-level slips; no closure-beat artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Information density is high: "She had learned to photosynthesize that darkness, to turn grief into something that fed others" does triple work (metaphor, motive, outcome). Figurative language is dense but coherent—photosynthesis, pollen, algae, reef-shadow—unified by the aquatic/organic register. Minor loop: "Somewhere in the reef's darkness, something wounded lifted its head to listen. Somewhere, a war was ending" recycles "Somewhere" without added pressure. One metaphor wobbles: "ocean memory and calcium prayers" pairs the concrete (calcium) with the abstract (prayers) in a way that strains the vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high (each sentence advances atmosphere or ritual). However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without respite: "sugar in time's indifferent waters," "diamond-hard," "moonlight carved from solidified," "purple-throated," "parched earth accepting rain," "rainbows of sound and color." This density creates a steady hum rather than peaks and valleys. Minor paraphrase loop: "deserted marvels" appears twice in proximity, and "extinct feelings/emotions" recurs without evolving pressure. Stock metaphor: "water through cupped hands." The closure image is vivid but the surrounding texture competes for attention rather than propelling toward it. No grammar errors; syntax varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic texture. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language ("grief had calcified into accusations") is coherent and purposeful. Clarity and propulsion are strong through the climax. Minor overwriting in the opening ("cathedral of silence where dead tongues waited for resurrection") adds texture without obscuring causality. Zero scaffolding or synonym churn; the final image ("empty of ink but full of possibility") recharges prior material cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clear and propulsive through most beats, with strong sensory detail (amber-to-violet reagent shift, sulfurous light, brass links cold then warm). However, several lines carry overwriting: "slyly heartfelt," "dappled resolve," and "Cognitive smoothness" feel elevated beyond Mira's established register. The phrase "encrypted compassion, a love letter written in the language of apparent guilt" stacks metaphors without clear imagery. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("machines weren't neutral... every gate and lever carried the weight" echoes the floodgate framing without added pressure). No loops touch the closure, limiting deductions to mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with multi-job lines: "She found it wrapped in a 1962 newspaper clipping about the Chassigny fall, a genuine fragment of Mars tucked between astronomy texts and star charts." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, especially in the confession beat where short syntax ("No," she said) lands cleanly. Two minor artifacts: "carrying words they could never understand across distances that must have felt infinite to their small hearts" layers sentiment that edges toward overwriting, and the journal passage recycles the fall/transform motif without fresh compression. No loops or scaffold clutter. The opening anchors voice and decay/possibility immediately. Clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with vivid specificity ("clouds that tasted of forgotten harvests," "light lied constantly"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or character. Two frictions: "necessary distances" appears in conceptual restatement across multiple paragraphs (paraphrase loop), and the phrase "fractured hush—that silence that wasn't silent but shattered into a thousand almost-sounds" over-explains its own metaphor. The closure beat remains clear, limiting penalty spread, but these artifacts prevent entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong imagery ("dropped away like a sigh," "liquid aurora"). However, minor template cadence appears in repeated "she/her" stems across multiple sentences, and some lines edge toward overwriting ("the strange, quiet certainty that she would return to the forgotten place where darkness and light stitched themselves together"). The final two paragraphs contain paraphrase loops restating the belonging-through-pause theme. No loops touch the closure image directly, limiting the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance image, emotion, or concept. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short at emotional peaks: "But there were missing pieces. There were always missing pieces."). Minor loop: "missing pieces" recurs across three beats without sufficient reweighting until the end. Template cadence in paragraph 14: "Some paths disappear because..." x3 creates a drumbeat that risks mechanical closure, though the specificity escalates. One weak nominalization: "her work" (paragraph 4) could sharpen to a concrete verb. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "cheerful gloom like a lantern" mixed slightly with earlier "second skin" metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Opening metaphor "saltwater reflected constellations like scattered chess pieces across a dark board" effectively fuses setting and motif. One paraphrase loop appears: "The bishop caught moonlight right on schedule. The silk woman gasped softly, noticing how the chess piece seemed to glow" restates the same beat without adding pressure (−0.2). Minor overwriting in "ancient columns and infinite stars" leans toward stock elevation. The closing image is strong, though "disappearing into darkness between columns" edges toward generic mystery-figure exit.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Opening and closing images are strong. However, several figurative constructions in the opening paragraph ("obsidian grace," "starlight pooled like spilled mercury," "ocean's breath") cluster without clear pattern-teaching, creating mild overwriting. The phrase "child she had been and the dancer she might become" paraphrases the prior "spaces between certainty and fear, between training and instinct" without adding new pressure. One minor loop: "The cosmic verses gleamed" in the final paragraph echoes prior mentions without fresh charge.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with good information density. Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Minor scaffold: "she had learned long ago," "she understood something else entirely" are near-filter constructions but remain voice-motivated. One paraphrase loop: paragraphs 6–7 restate "value in attention/moments" without added pressure (−0.2). "Noctilucent reckonings" and "careful hand" metaphors border on elevated but do not obscure causality. No loops or artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies well; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Clarity is strong throughout. Minor issues: "hard softness of grief" in the reflection passage feels slightly ornamental; "enlighten himself about the nature of loss" borders on abstract telling where an image might serve better. The phrase "by reflecting deeply" in paragraph nine reads as a prompt echo. No loops or major scaffold, but a few beats in the middle third could tighten. Propulsion is solid; closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is mostly clean with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors ("tide-polished," "saltwater misting," "brass needle"). Information density is high in the opening third, and the grotto's mechanics are woven through action rather than exposition. However, a handful of abstract constructions lean toward tell without sufficient dramatization: "serene upheaval," "logical dreamer," "lucidly watchful" function as labels rather than images, and the penultimate paragraph summarizes theme ("Hope... was not an emotion but an equation") where a concrete image would sharpen closure. Minor template cadence in reflection passages ("She had learned...," "Tomorrow she would...") and one paraphrase loop around "trial balloons" (grandmother's teaching restated across two beats). No filter-verb stacks or major loops, but figurative language occasionally prioritizes elegance over propulsion in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density is high in the discovery sequence where diaries, negative, and sensor data layer efficiently. Minor scaffold appears in parallel constructions ("Helena had been...Helena had written...Helena had given") that create slight momentum drag in the middle section. The opening and closing images are strong, particularly "Walls remembered" and the final dream reversal. Figurative language occasionally stacks ("living tunnels of green and shadow," "fossils in sediment," "weight of accumulated stone") but remains mostly coherent and voice-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful, but several beats loop conceptually: the painter's elusiveness is restated in paragraph one, and "borrowed heartbeats" and "persuasion of mirrors" recur without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("She worked with borrowed heartbeats. This was her secret…" / "She understood mirrors…"). Minor filter-verb stacks ("She understood," "She knew") cluster in reflective passages. Closure image is vivid, but the final paragraph's moralizing summary ("what we might become matters more than what we are") deflates propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift purposefully. Information density is high in the opening (terrace history, clipboard lineage, Forever War context). However, paraphrase loops appear: "flawed beauty" recurs three times across paragraphs without evolving meaning; "She was tired. She had always been tired" is conceptual redundancy. Template cadence in the midsection: "She reviewed...She had learned...She opened" stacks protagonist-verb stems. The final metaphor "bleeding across the horizon, promising nothing, offering everything" strains coherence (how does bleeding promise?). No causality breaks, but scaffold and figurative muddle lower precision.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies appropriately, opening with long sentences that compress to shorter beats at closure. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. One paraphrase loop: "She had no illusions about redemption. She would die as she had lived, neither hero nor villain but something more honest" restates the prior paragraph's amoral-philanthropist framing without added pressure (−0.2). A few filter verbs ("she could hear," "she knew") slightly dull immediacy. No significant template cadence or mixed metaphors, and the closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense ("her spine curved like a question mark, her arms extended like answers") but occasionally overwritten in high-pressure beats. The transformation beat—"between sigh and smile"—compresses the pivotal closure moment into a metaphor that elides dramatization. Paraphrase loops appear: "the threads loosened one by one, and the echoes began to sing" recaps information already shown. Template cadence in the opening ("They called her… a contradiction that made… and…") and stacked filter-adjacent phrasing ("she felt the harvest complete itself") slightly dull immediacy. No major scaffold or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or conflict. Opening and closing images are strong. Minor deductions: "the thing that had driven them apart tonight and kept pulling them back together" is slightly abstract scaffolding that could be cut; "though she would later deny it" is a brief future-tense intrusion that weakens immediacy. The phrase "meteor hush" recurs three times, verging on over-reliance, but each use recontextualizes the image, so it reads purposeful rather than looped.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies effectively; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("living river of fire," "slow rivers" of clouds). Some phrases loop conceptually: "overlooked histories, the ones that slipped between official records" restates the premise without adding pressure. "Blushing stillness" recurs purposefully but borders on motif over-reliance. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("transiently rooted," "interrupted cadence," "blushing stillness") in close succession, slightly dulling clarity. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, and premise together. Sentence openings vary and rhythm breathes with the scene. Minor scaffold appears in the grandmother exposition paragraph: "The paper was yellow and brittle, holes punched in a pattern…" followed by "Her grandmother had cranked the organ…" feels slightly list-like without immediate scene pressure. The closure paragraph's fragment cascade ("The aurora faded. The ice sang with names. And Elin, at last, remembered.") is purposeful and lands cleanly. No loops or synonym churn. One small clarity slip: "not recorded, but woven into the music itself" slightly tells what the punched card mechanism already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies well and information density is high. Two patterns lower the score: mild figurative density in the middle third ("rivers are hungry for the sea," "paths still hoped to be chosen") that slightly slows momentum, and several abstract near-loops ("paths not taken," "roads not taken," "phantom timelines" recycled across paragraphs). The final paragraph avoids loops and closes cleanly. Proofreading is solid, no grammar breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and closing paragraphs. However, mid-story paragraphs loop conceptually: "empirically ironic results" is paraphrased across lines without added pressure, and the observation sequence relies on summary ("hour by hour, the pattern emerged") rather than dramatized beats. Minor template cadence appears in the polymath backstory section. Figurative language ("breadcrumbs of truth," "bridge built from numbers") is stock in places. The prose is clean and grammatical but does not propel with urgency; peak beats (the sequence reveal) are told rather than shown in sensory or tactical detail.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or concept. The opening ("sound itself refused to exist here") anchors voice and stakes cleanly. A few minor scaffold phrases appear: "today, a visitor came" reads as boilerplate transition, and "the resentment in him was real" restates what's been shown. The phrase "scheming pacifist, her enemies would say, though she preferred the term 'strategic healer'" contains mild synonym churn. Figurative language is dense ("framework of grievances," "chains of taught hatred") but mostly coherent; no sustained loops or template cadence. Propulsion is steady, and the final image recharges the music box motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high: mirrors, breath, fog mechanics, and sextant all advance understanding. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight the fog motif effectively. Deductions: "firmly grounded" appears twice in close proximity as a thematic anchor but risks template phrasing; "approach the glass mountains slowly, as a mirror maker approaches perfection—through patience, through craft, through the understanding" employs a list structure that slightly stalls momentum in the penultimate beat.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, propulsive, and carries high information density—most sentences advance setting, character, or theme. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and the opening/closing images anchor well. Minor scaffold detected: "Now it was the color of fog" stands alone as a beat when it could integrate into the prior sentence for tighter momentum. A few near-paraphrase adjacencies in the journal discovery section ("Instructions," "For what?" / "For teaching you") feel slightly template-like but don't obscure causality. Figurative language (leaves like green snow, fruit glowing like lanterns) is controlled and doesn't overwrite. No major loops or clarity breaks; stays comfortably in the 7.5–8.0 range but doesn't reach 8.5+ due to the small scaffold moments.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are mostly distinct, but several beats carry decorative figurative language without clear propulsion: "a smile from someone who knew too much about your future," "knowledge that moved backward through time." The phrase "simply complicated" appears twice without added pressure. Paraphrase loops appear in the bathroom section: "The answer came... as understanding" followed immediately by restating the same nonlinear-inheritance concept. Template stems recur: "she understood" appears three times in close succession in the final third. These artifacts dull momentum and disallow 9+ globally; applying −0.6 in Q7 for template cadence and minor synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm modulates appropriately (short beats at the mountain's shudder, longer exposition blocks earlier). Information density is high in the botanical diary descriptions and the gap-language conceit. Three distinct issues lower the score: (1) metaphor density in every other sentence without pattern-teaching ("chambers of a nautilus shell," "thread in an unheard symphony," "bloomed like impossible flowers") creating a lyric haze; (2) filter-verb stack in the time traveler's watch-and-admit sequence; (3) synonym churn around "knowledge/wisdom/lessons" in the final third. The closure image ("sunlight waited like a question") is vivid, but the prior line's "patient as always, but perhaps—for the first time—hopeful" is scaffold-like philosophizing. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.0 in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; opening and closing images carry charge. Minor scaffold appears: "She was trying to..." / "I've been trying to..." creates near-loop, and "memories alter" / "as memories alter" recycles phrasing. The phrase "raw material of longing" and "inventing what she couldn't remember, creating truth" tell rather than compress high-stakes beats. Figurative language (Ferris wheel as "forgotten promise," support poles as "pleading hands") occasionally stacks without causal work. Density is moderate; no severe artifacts touch closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean with strong information density and vivid concrete detail. Rhythm varies appropriately, and the opening/closing frame works well. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The door shouldn't exist, yet here it was" is immediately echoed by touching "its surface," and the paragraph beginning "The fables of absence" restates what the prior action has already shown. Template cadence in the middle section: "She touched... She opened... She began..." Minor filter-verb stack ("could see," "realized," "understood") in rapid succession mid-story. These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull immediacy in non-closure beats. Apply −0.6 for pattern density per the artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean with high information density and purposeful rhythm variation. Sentence openings vary; paragraphs create visual breath. Strong specific verbs (groaned, squeezed, tingled) anchor action. Minor slip: "gently luminous" appears three times in similar constructions, creating slight template echo. The phrase "sounds like struck metal sustained beyond natural decay" effectively conveys alien quality. Figurative language (frozen waves, water meeting oil) serves clarity rather than ornament. No loops or scaffold detected; momentum builds steadily through spatial descent to closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but figurative language clusters in most paragraphs without clear pattern-teaching: "thistle-blown hope—fragile, windswept, stubborn enough to root in barren soil" functions more as decoration than pressure. Stock phrasing appears in emotional beats: "heart pounding," "gasped," "trembling." Paraphrase loop in the vision sequence: Vera's discovery is stated, then restated with minimal added detail. The opening and closing images carry purposeful weight, but mid-story beats occasionally pad with synonym variation ("consumed by her search for meaning. But meaning had found her instead").

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; rhythm varies across beats (short declarations at the dial, longer lyric cadence during descent). Clarity holds; no pronoun confusion or template runs. Overwriting check flags moderate figurative load in middle third ("confluence of rivers," "discoloring the water," "palimpsest") without full integration into the closure image. One paraphrase loop: "collective memory she served was not merely historical preservation. It was the raw material…" restates across two sentences. The final paragraph's "terrible beauty of watching certainty dissolve" nears stock phrasing. Combined artifacts justify mid-7s; they do not obscure causality but dull local propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lyrical with strong rhythm and imagery ("dusk bled the sky into bruised purples," "tiny mouths gasping"). Information density is high; sentences often layer image, action, and emotion. Minor issues: "Fire remembers what flesh forgets" and similar aphorisms border on purple without clear payoff. "Serious playfulness" in the preparation paragraph reads as imported descriptor rather than dramatized state. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though some metaphors ("something liberated") lack specificity. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean with varied rhythm and high information density. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges "emergence" motif. Figurative language (time as tides, pools as universes, cicadas as transition) is coherent and purposeful. Minor scaffold: "warmly observant" appears twice in identical phrasing; the phrase "ancient and patient" recurs; and the final paragraph's "The tides would continue... The pools would fill..." feels slightly mechanical in its thematic summary. No loops obscure causality, and propulsion remains steady.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("amber light," "golden floor," vines reaching "downward toward the clouds"). Minor loop: "her chest stretching contracted, expanding and tightening" restates the same physiological contradiction without added detail. The "First, she would..." triad at the end borders on scaffold repetition but remains voice-motivated. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and no major artifacts touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, with longer contemplative sentences balanced by crisp action beats ("She opened the storm glass vial"). Minor overwriting clusters appear: "fluidly logical" recurs decoratively, and "the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo settled over the drifting prism terrace like dust made of light" stacks metaphors without clear payoff. One paraphrase loop: paragraphs 8–9 restate the terrace's acoustic properties. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; the helix-as-staircase image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, movement, atmosphere). Clarity and momentum are strong; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor register drift: "algorithmic governance" and "market forces" feel slightly external to Meridia's immediate experience. One figurative cluster near the end ("branches stretched into impossible distances, each one a path...each one a future") edges toward abstraction but doesn't obscure the closure beat. Grammar and tense are clean. The opening and closing lines frame the arc effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings differ; information density is high ("the boundary between her sanctuary and the world beyond had grown thin as smoke, permeable as grief"). Minor loop: "burned bridges carefully, never in anger, always with the precision of a surgeon" and "teach suffocating to breathe" echo prompt language without transformation. Filter verbs ("she felt it," "she understood") are present but not stacked. Metaphor coherence is strong ("threshold," "bridges," "doorways"). Figurative density in the opening paragraph is high but establishes the lyric mode. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several prose artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("pressure wasn't just destructive" / "turning the weight of the world"), elevated metaphor clusters in peak beats ("grief made gorgeous," "shame compressed into clarity"), and stock phrasing ("trembling fingers," "quiet rebellions"). The opening line anchors effectively, but the final paragraph over-explains the thematic resonance rather than trusting the diamond image. Clarity remains intact and no major causality breaks occur, but the figurative density in the climax slightly obscures the concrete transformation mechanics. Template cadence appears in the parallel-Vera catalog ("One who'd never been scammed. One who'd become the scammer. One who'd given up entirely.").

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically rich, with vivid phrases like "amber light pooled like honey" and "bone dust." However, several beats lean into overwriting: stacked modifiers ("languid suspension," "moth-gray silk"), figurative density without pattern payoff, and near-paraphrase loops (the grandmother's silence is restated multiple times across paragraphs). The phrase "standing waves" recurs as a thematic anchor but risks becoming a placeholder for unearned mysticism. Sentence openings vary, but the descriptive texture occasionally slows momentum in a story already heavy on reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several phrases lean toward overwriting: "shivering bliss" appears twice, "the shape of possibility" and "the shape of certainty" echo within one beat, and "forever becoming" in the final line risks vague abstraction. The program's pages "turn without wind" and "lift from the page" as golden threads—vivid, but the metaphor vehicle (threads as both literal and mystical) is not fully grounded in physical logic. One paraphrase loop: "He should have left it...but his fingers recognized" restates hesitation-then-action already shown. Information density is high, but figurative saturation in the climax (web, threads, marionette, vessel, puppeteer) risks muddle without pattern-teaching earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence rhythm varies naturally with no algorithmic patterns. Minor scaffold appears: "which children had been sought, which had been abandoned twice over" and later "she would never stop being broken-hearted... she would also never stop looking" both rely on mirrored phrasing, but the repetition is purposeful and charges the closure rather than padding. No paraphrase loops, register drift, or clarity issues. Figurative language (dust as scripture, something "unfurl in her chest") is selective and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with varied syntax. Some scaffold and near-loops: "Too quiet, they said. Too compliant" followed immediately by "She had cultivated that perception carefully, resourcefully" restates the underestimation without adding pressure. "Carefully resourceful" recurs as a label in multiple beats without fresh embodiment. The opening "archives said / first history they revised" parallelism is purposeful; the puddle-reflection passage is vivid and concretely rendered. Final paragraphs edge into summary rather than scene density.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished with strong sensory detail and rhythm that supports the contemplative pace. However, several patterns accumulate: "felt the prophecy" appears three times in the final third; "quietly vivid" and "radiant" recur as descriptors without reweighting; metaphoric density is high throughout ("whispered secrets," "virus," "shroud woven from fog") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff. The phrase "It was an eerie nostalgia that filled her now" offers direct emotional labeling at a key beat rather than embodying the sensation. Information density is moderate; some sentences paraphrase prior content ("The chain would end with her" after establishing she has no children).

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.1)
    Clarity and momentum are strong; information density is high (each line advances atmosphere or stakes). Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally stacks: "edges blur, certainties soften" and "mossy delight bloom...like something long dormant finally finding sun" in close proximity. Template cadence appears twice: "She had sorted..." / "She had learned..." / "She used it to prod..." / "She understood, finally..." Each beat starts with subject-verb, flattening rhythm. No paraphrase loops, but the scaffold "She [verb]" recurs enough to trigger mild monotony. Sentence variety improves in the hush section. Opening and closing lines anchor well.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is controlled and rhythmically varied; opening and closing images bookend effectively. Information density is high in the descent and discovery beats. Minor loop: "beneath the ashes" recurs three times with similar phrasing; "uncertainty" and "precision" are paired repeatedly without added nuance. Template cadence appears in the three-message sequence ("first time could have been...second time...third time"). Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally dense ("subterranean cathedral," "impossibly blue glow," "eternal fall") in adjacent lines without pattern-teaching. No major clarity breaks; propulsion remains steady.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift; information density is high (each beat advances character, atmosphere, or plot). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting appears in figurative clusters: "scattered stars falling to earth," "luminous shadows," "captured tears," "golden seams" within close proximity risks density without payoff. The phrase "factually mystical" in paragraph three and "luminous regret" moments trend toward decorative rather than earned through action. Proofreading is clean; action sequence is clear; the closure beat ("walked out into the brightening day") propels without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor issues: "She was a healer. She had always been. And there were more souls waiting, more laughter to offer against the dark" employs short declarative stems that read slightly template-like at the climax. "The ache she had carried for so long began to shift, transforming from weight into warmth" paraphrases the shift rather than embodying it through image. No major loops or clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong, with vivid images ("violet pain," "pewter mask strap"). Information density is high; most sentences advance character state or world logic. However, several beats stack abstract intensifiers without concrete anchors: "terrifying clarity," "supernatural precision," "cold optimization function." Minor paraphrase loop near midpoint: "the forest was a living computer" restates what the prior paragraph showed. Template cadence in trauma-reflection beats ("She had…", "They had…") appears three times consecutively, dulling propulsion. No filter-verb stacks or closure-beat artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop or restate: "elusively tangible" appears twice in similar constructions; "between-worlds" and "between-spaces" recur without evolving meaning; "the anchors of intuition" is quoted verbatim twice. Figurative language is dense in the climactic paragraph ("eternal instant where past and present pressed together like palms in prayer," "weight and weightlessness") without clear payoff. Minor scaffold appears ("Now, between childhood and now"). The final image is vivid, but the penultimate paragraph overworks metaphor at a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean with varied rhythm and strong information density. "The weight of it surprised her, substantial yet somehow carrying its own lightness, a weightless burden of memory and craft" threads motif without redundancy. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Minor softness: "remarkable detailed" could tighten to "detailed," and "the boundary between the two" slightly hedges. The phrase "skillfully observant" in paragraph four reads as light tell rather than embodied observation, but the closure beat is artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is strong in places ("Books rustled on their branches, pages fluttering like birds sensing a coming storm") but shows several loops: "perfect" appears repeatedly without escalation, "the frost" is re-anchored across adjacent paragraphs, and the phrase "perfect systems" / "perfection" recurs without accumulating new pressure. Sentence openings vary well. Figurative density is high throughout without a taught pattern; some images blur rather than sharpen ("moved like longing," "vibrational key"). Clarity remains mostly intact, but the accumulation of decorative metaphor in non-peak beats costs momentum. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase and metaphor stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies well, opening with the baroque asteroid image and closing with the uncovered mirrors. Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Minor scaffold: "She understood now" is a stock epiphany marker, and the phrase "felt hollow, burnished with a sorrow she couldn't shake" contains near-synonym pairing ("hollow"/"sorrow"). The temporal storm descriptions are vivid but repeated phrasing ("temporal storms," "temporal flow," "temporal bliss," "temporal currents") across multiple paragraphs creates a minor loop effect. No major grammatical errors; figurative language is mostly coherent, though "heart that spoke in verse" borders on ornamental. Overall propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (chip, note, wilting, seven boxes all advance). "Mend what isn't torn" and "covenant of rust" do multiple jobs without padding. Minor loop: "The chip brightened" / "The chip blazed brighter" across two beats feels slightly repetitive. Figurative language ("flower opening to dawn," "streams flowing into a river") is dense but mostly earned by the lyric mode; one mixed vehicle: rust as "song sung in a minor key" then "transmuting" blurs the metaphor slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or concept). The opening and closing images are strong. Minor issues: "sensibly eccentric at best, delusional at worst" is slightly template-phrased; "the smell of rain on dry earth carried memories, and memories could be harvested" borders on thesis statement in paragraph one; "something like coming home to a room she had always owned but never entered" stacks metaphor vehicles in the penultimate paragraph. No loops or pronoun drift; clarity is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity holds, but template cadence and paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "She would return... She would learn... She would add" (three-beat parallel); "no longer lost... never been lost" (synonym churn). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "forgotten doorway," "bridge across wet rocks," "golden lines," "turbine-hum," "mechanical meditation." The closure beat ("carrying centuries... weight of future connections") stacks abstractions where a concrete image would sharpen. Mixed metaphor: "storm to strip away everything that obscured the path"—storms obscure rather than clarify. Baseline artifacts trigger −0.6 in Q7; touching closure adds −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (each paragraph advances understanding or setting). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is purposeful: "stone in her chest," "silver streams," "midnight congregation." Minor overwriting: "umbral tenderness," "something like breath," and stacked modifiers in a few beats ("honey-colored panes," "copper light," "whisper of white") approach density without muddle. The transition from winter to spring is compressed efficiently. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and resonance cleanly. Pronoun references are clear; no simultaneity errors or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is mostly strong: rhythm varies, opening and closing images anchor stakes, spatial choreography is clear. Information density is high in the diary-decoding passages. Minor pattern debt: "She had been…she'd discovered…she had witnessed" clusters similar stems in the opening third, and phrases like "searing reverie" and "bittersweet knowledge" feel stock-metaphor adjacent in peak beats. No paraphrase loops, but the final paragraph's "she carried…she carried" repetition leans scaffolded. These accumulate to −0.6 in Q7 without touching closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong information density in the memory-access sequence. Minor loop: "sealed bottle" / "amber bottle" / "bottle" recur without tonal shift across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence appears mid-story: "She saw... She felt... She witnessed..." stacks three consecutive stems in the memory flood. Figurative language is purposeful (lanterns as "hollow promises," light through paper) but "the accumulated weight of ordinary moments chosen and cherished" and "fragile bridge between perception and permanence" edge toward elevated abstraction that slightly dulls immediacy. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong, with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. However, several passages exhibit overwriting: "velvet disquiet," "bruised plums," "frequencies of grief and wonder" stack figurative language without tight causal linkage. The phrase "accidentally speak the future while trying to preserve the past" in mid-story and the closing summary "she had been building a map all along" create paraphrase loops that restate the premise rather than advance it. Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph: "still writing, still speaking, still listening." Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood," "she discovered") cluster without always serving immediacy. Information density is high in ritual description but dips in reflective passages. No major causality breaks, but the scaffold and figurative density prevent entry into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Minor template cadence appears in mid-story ("She had discovered," "She understood," "She opened") but does not obscure causality. Figurative language is dense ("silver ribbons," "brief constellations," "luminous serpent") and occasionally stacks without clear additive purpose ("spiral of light that still rotated slowly" followed by "vortex inheritance"). No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary adequately. The final paragraph achieves strong propulsion and clarity. Artifacts present but do not reach the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies well ("She wanted to favor listening over noise. She wanted to understand what the world said when it whispered instead of screamed.") and information density is high. The bell rope's evolution (traced → mended → tacky → dried) advances both object state and plot. Minor paraphrase appears: "warning itself became obsolete, when the listening finally mattered more than the sound" echoes the want/listening dichotomy established earlier, creating a slight conceptual loop. Figurative language ("ripples in still water," "patient as prayer") is purposeful and spaced. A few filter verbs ("she had come," "she had watched") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; imagery does double work (lantern as tool and thematic anchor). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at meteor sightings and slowing for reflection. Paraphrase loop detected: "Here, she was small. Here, her life was a single breath..." repeats conceptually without added pressure (−0.3). Template cadence: "Some things endured...Some things found..." at closure reads as parallel structure but borders on scaffold (−0.2). No filter-verb stacks or metaphor muddle. Clarity and momentum remain intact, but the loops prevent entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong rhythm and vivid imagery ("cracked earth bleeding heat into the copper sky," "mirages made manifest"). However, minor scaffold appears: "Now everyone could see them" and the immediate pivot to "But Maren stayed" reads slightly mechanical, and "understanding blooming like a flower in dry soil" verges on stock metaphor. Information density is high, and no paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks appear in peak beats. The closure image ("bees of gold across the walls") charges prior material effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clear with purposeful figurative density ("seconds visible as shimmering green waves," "time collects like dust on forgotten shelves"). However, several adjacent lines restate the capsule's purpose without added pressure ("wasn't meant to preserve objects... meant to preserve a method"), triggering a paraphrase-loop deduction. Minor stock phrasing: "anticipated mysteries yet to unfold" and "texture of all our passing" lean toward generic lyricism. The closure image is clean and propulsive, but mid-section scaffold slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clean with purposeful rhythm and selective sensory detail. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, minor loops appear: "warmly attentive" echoes "patient attention," and "burnished hush" recurs without reweighting. Template cadence is minimal. One figurative misstep: "The lagoon held its breath" at the end is a stock personification that dulls the closure image. Information density is generally high, but the final paragraph over-explains ("adding another thread") where image alone would suffice. No major artifacts touch closure, but the slight redundancy and one weak metaphor prevent entry to 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences vary in structure and the read-aloud rhythm supports the accumulative design: longer observational beats alternate with shorter action moments. Information density is high—most lines advance Maren's work, the orchard's response, or thematic layering. Minor scaffold appears in paired constructions ("not built but grown," "not electricity exactly, but intention") that lean formulaic, and "brazen calm" recurs three times without functional variation, costing momentum. The closure image is clean and propulsive. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the amber meditation paragraphs. Two minor loops: "They had been watching Earth for a long time. Long enough to see forests rise and fall, species emerge and vanish, continents reshape themselves" restates duration; "always searching, always returning, always trying" uses parallel template stems. The "bronze quiet" recurs cleanly (windows, final chamber beat). No scaffold or mixed metaphors. Propulsion is steady but the extended reflection in the middle third slightly softens momentum before the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (the opening line establishes time, place, Erasmus's role, and the phosphorescent anomaly). Rhythm varies purposefully; longer accumulative sentences ("Calcium, phosphorus, the accumulated life...") contrast with short declarative beats ("Each evening he performed this ritual"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor filter-verb presence ("he had learned," "he watched") does not dull immediacy given the reflective mode. The phrase "narrow vastness" recurs three times but earns its reprise by charging the final image. One small slip: "resurrection it would never witness" edges toward summary-tell where image would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse; clarity is high throughout. Information density is strong in the riddle and excavation sequences. Minor issues: "wild hush pervaded everything here, the silence of a world holding its breath" is near-redundant (hush = silence). "Tinted revelations came slowly" in the map paragraph is abstract and slightly inflated for the concrete moment. A few adjacent lines paraphrase without adding pressure. No major loops, but small scaffold reduces propulsion in two beats.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("temporally stretched like taffy," "each beat a sustained drumroll") clarifies rather than obscures the time-dilation concept. Information density is high in the observation-deck description and sketch ritual. However, several paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 12-13 restate Mira's initial despair and recovery; "blessed and cursed" repeats across three paragraphs with minor variation; "echoed silence" appears twice as identical phrasing. Template cadence in the middle section ("She had raged... screamed... wept... Then she had found...") stacks parallel constructions without payoff. These artifacts don't obscure closure but create local drag, warranting −0.6 under the patterned-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop conceptually: "embrace the unknown with open arms" appears twice, "sacredly playful" echoes across beats, and "wonder demanded both" in the weeping-laughing line reads as thematic summary rather than embodied action. Stock metaphor "morning frost" and elevated diction in peak beats (vault opening, letter reading) reduce immediacy by −0.6. No severe artifacts touch closure, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high—most sentences layer setting, character history, and thematic image without padding. Rhythm varies purposefully: longer accumulative paragraphs for backstory, shorter beats for the pawn-placement and exit. One paraphrase loop: "She had been benevolently ruthless with herself" in the penultimate paragraph restates the chessboard observation without fresh pressure, costing ~−0.3. "Nomadic penumbra" and "luminous absence" are elevated but voice-coherent; no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence runs. Minor scaffold in "This was why she came. This was why she had petitioned…" (anaphora that flirts with redundancy but serves emphasis).

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information density is high—most lines do two jobs (e.g., "the bookstore that occupied the entire mountain" anchors setting and scale; "mercury-glass seer" signals transformation and reflection). Rhythm varies with purpose: short declaratives at discovery beats, longer syntactic coils during reflection. Zero paraphrase loops. One cluster of filter verbs in the middle third ("she felt," "she understood") slightly dulls immediacy but does not touch closure. Figurative language (whorls of shell, insects beneath glass, hidden thunder) is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor: "impossible softness" and "colors she had no names for" trend slightly generic in an otherwise specific register.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies well ("The thunder rolled…never arrived and never faded" vs. "Thread by thread, Marcus decoded the pattern"), and information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, motive, or closure setup. Minor loop: "The woven hush" recurs three times with slight variation, and "hands never stopped moving" / "hands finally still" feels template-balanced rather than organic contrast. Figurative density is controlled except in one beat: "knowledge like water, carrying weight, something unknotted" stacks three metaphors in quick succession without full integration. Clarity remains strong, and the final image (flour drifting, swing creaking, clock striking) propels without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. "Through impromptu poetry sessions" is light scaffolding but functional. Minor register drift: "unauthorized memory," "elegantly subversive," "ambient murmur" feel slightly elevated for the POV's internal texture under stress. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density is high; propulsion is steady. The closure beat is clear and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies; opening/closing lines anchor voice and image. Information density is high in the matching beats. Two loops lower the score: "Each pit and crater...told a story" followed by "Each imperfection...corresponded to a fracture" restates the conceit without added pressure. "Clicking dark" and later "clicking mechanisms" recur without fresh detail. Template stems: "She saw...She saw" and "She was...She was" cluster in adjacent lines. The "quilting" metaphor appears three times; two feel redundant. Figurative density ("hungry fingers," "cathedral of gears," "rivers on a map") mostly integrates but occasionally stacks without breathing room.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Figurative language is mostly controlled ("cathedral built by water and time," "living punctuation"), though "mineral tears" and "salt and secrets" edge toward stock poeticism. The phrase "intimately aloof from everything except the canvas" is repeated, creating a minor template echo. One paraphrase loop: "The world existed at arm's length, close enough to study, far enough to bear. This was how he had survived—present enough to create, distant enough to endure." Propulsion slows slightly in the reflective middle paragraph about art teacher's wisdom. No major artifacts touch closure, so non-closure cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: "paint the exact color of exhaustion after the heat wave finally broke" does triple work (setting, mood, timeframe). Some scaffolding appears: "It didn't matter" and "She knew what the scent meant" are tell-y shortcuts. The phrase "screaming tenderness, the kind that tears at your throat even in silence" over-explains the paradox rather than trusting the image. Clarity is strong throughout, and no paraphrase loops or template cadence appears. Figurative language is dense but controlled—"bruise," "fallen prayers," "fingers like dried flowers"—though the concentration approaches overwriting in the opening third.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and most lines advance character or atmosphere. Strong moments: "the geography of loss had already claimed every other place," "some kinds of navigation required an anchor to memory." However, several phrases approach overwriting: "wheeling overhead, indifferent and eternal" stacks modifiers, and "flickering in raw solace against the endless dark" loads the final image with slightly forced lyricism. Minor template cadence in the construction sequence ("She positioned each mirror... creating a constellation... When dawn approached, she placed...") and one paraphrase loop around the beacon's purpose reduce precision.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in action beats (the unpacking, the fitting, the weeping). Opening and closing images anchor and recharge (storm losses → trees holding on). Minor artifacts: "She thought of... She thought of..." template cadence in the decision paragraph; "psychological safety" repeated three times across the piece without evolving meaning; "the glass eye watched... patient as a seed waiting for rain" is a mixed metaphor (inorganic eye/organic seed). These issues cluster in reflective passages and slightly dull momentum. Clarity and propulsion remain strong in present-tense action.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is controlled and dense: "The opal dock stretched into the mist like a pale finger pointing toward nothing" opens with clear image and tone. Information layering is efficient (logbook → three days prior → handwriting familiar yet not his own). Rhythm varies sentence length and structure purposefully. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting in places: "the softly persistent pull that had guided his stranger instincts" and "the sea took his body, but his love stayed stubborn" both stack modifiers that slightly blur momentum. The opening and closing images bracket cleanly. One figurative stumble: "bruised light of nautical twilight" is vivid but "bruised" competes with "iridescent" in the same sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively: short beats at key moments ("She made her decision."), longer architectural sentences for the doorway vision. Information density is high—most lines advance plot, character knowledge, or atmospheric pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. The phrase "empirically intuitive sense" borders on over-articulation but serves character specificity. Minor scaffold: "The descent took hours" compresses transit efficiently, but "stopped her breath" is a stock physical reaction. The final paragraph's annotated-map reveal carries high density and propels the ending cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with clear propulsion; most sentences advance image, choice, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully (short bursts during the climb, longer legato sentences in the grotto). One template-cadence cluster in the penultimate section: "By dawn... By noon... By evening..." reads mechanical but is brief and does not obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and charge the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (each line advances character, metaphor, or thematic argument). However, several passages loop or paraphrase: "She thought of her work—her entire life's purpose compressed into a single impossible question" restates what the prior paragraphs have shown, and "All of it present, all of it weighted with directed spontaneity" is a near-synonym stack. The metaphor cluster (spiral, density, weight, presence) recurs with purpose but occasionally tips into decoration ("golden fractals," "palette of resolve"). Figurative language is dense in the closure beat without muddle, yet the template cadence ("What if I told you... What if that's already...") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("emotional chemistry," "revaluation happening behind his eyes") slightly dull immediacy. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and register drift touching mid-story beats.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is largely clean with strong rhythm variation and information density. Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Minor loop detected: "the dreams bled backward and forward" is restated as "temporal chaos" within three lines. "Jade of her exhaustion" is likely a misuse (jade as noun for jaded). Some sentences do double duty well ("The grave would still be there... marking an ending she was finally ready to stop fearing"). Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed register moment. No major scaffold or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the screw-diagnosis beat. Two minor loops: "trembling" appears in "trembling hands" and "trembling calm" in close proximity; "reading between lines" is stated both in the premise paragraph and near the end ("read between the lines of broken things"). Figurative language is dense—most sentences carry metaphor or simile—but coherent and voice-motivated. No major scaffold or template cadence. Clarity is good; the final paragraph's "drop by drop, life by life, story by story" is a deliberate parallelism that coheres with the piece's lyric mode. Line-level control is strong but the density of figuration in high-pressure beats (screw cleaning, final exchange) approaches overwriting without crossing into obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening long lyric line contrasts with later tight action beats. Information density is high: "The crow quill trimmed tip lay beside the ceremonial scroll, its edge sharp enough to inscribe the runes she had spent three years learning to read but never dared to write" does four jobs (introduces object, signals stakes, shows progression, sets up turn). No loops or synonym churn. Minor density slip: "Storm" appears in six distinct noun phrases within 800 words (tempest, storms-memory/promise, storm-killed, storms-petition, storms-tea, storms-weathered/coming), creating slight thematic saturation without advancing distinct meaning in each instance. Figurative language is controlled and consistent with voice.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the opening (archive, Marcus's reputation, the mission established in three paragraphs). However, several lines lean toward purple: "her voice like wind through hollow reeds," "a sound like paper tearing," "darkness emerged...like smoke from a extinguished candle" stack similes without clear differentiation. The phrase "a extinguished" is a grammatical error. Metaphoric density in the middle third ("space between notes," "nothing is ever truly lost") risks decorative clustering, though the closure paragraph regains propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting density penalty: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats (scrolls glowing, protagonist transforming) carries figurative language ("dissolution," "synthesis," "transparent," "resounding hush") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.5. Paraphrase loops present: "unraveling was not destruction but translation" / "unraveling that was also, always, a weaving together" restate the same thesis without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence: "She [verb]" stems repeat across multiple beats without rhythmic variation. Stock metaphor strings ("thread," "masks," "veil," "lens") cluster without fresh synthesis. Information density remains high in description but low in causal advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance multiple jobs (setting, character history, thematic prep). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the countdown. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The figurative language (clocks "leaning closer," fjord quiet "pressing") is coherent and controlled. Minor deduction: "perpetual twilight where sea met sky" in the opener and "the place where sea met sky" at close risk mild ornamental repetition, though the final use does charge the image. Clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clean with strong imagery (submarine greenish light, clover scent, cracked mica) and varied syntax. Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, several paraphrase loops and scaffold constructions appear: the "lucid contradiction" concept is restated across multiple paragraphs without advancing meaning, and "traverse" recurs mechanically. The phrase "theoretically rebellious" appears twice as a label without fresh pressure. Filter verbs ("She understood," "She had started," "She would pay") stack in the resolution section, flattening immediacy when dramatization would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: short declarations at key turns ("Wait." "Start there."), longer accretions for backstory ("Danny had loved astronomy and burned every breakfast…"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled and mostly functional (disc as "crystalline curve," silence as "germinating"). One overwriting moment: "The effect was melodically haunted, each shift in illumination seeming to carry its own note of sorrow" stacks metaphor density in a way that slightly blurs the beat's function. The closing "cultivating the necessary distance" risks abstraction but lands as thematic closure rather than scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished with purposeful imagery ("mist given form," "pages turning in wind") and varied syntax. However, multiple lines loop thematically without advancing pressure: "weight of small moments" appears three times, "gently thorough" twice, "through proximate causes" three times. The phrase "Add this to your archive" followed by "The woman who believed in small things" recycles the theme stated earlier. Template cadence appears in the Keeper exchange ("You found the records" / "I found everything"). Opening and closing lines frame well, but mid-passage explanation ("All those years cataloguing...she had been doing sacred work") flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with varied syntax and high information density. Figurative language (ivy as "living shrouds," "gentle chains") is coherent and functional. No major loops or scaffold detected. Minor issues: "improbable rumor chains" summarizes the three-month search rather than dramatizing any friction; the phrase "bound by reciprocity" appears in both Okonkwo's explanation and Maya's closing thought, creating slight echo without added pressure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Rhythm accelerates cleanly through the lab revelation without drag.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (establishing world, character perception, advancing plot). Minor loop appears: "The platinum compass ring" introduced in graf three, then "the platinum ring" repeated closely in graf four without added pressure. The phrase "quiet blaze" appears identically in two locations as a thematic anchor rather than evolving usage. "Frequencies" and variants recur frequently but serve the ultrasonic-language premise. Figurative language is generally controlled, though "threads through... like silver wire through cloth" and "quiet blaze" lean toward stock metaphor territory. No major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Opening and closing images are strong. However, the piece carries template-cadence runs ("She had come here... she had found"; "Tomorrow she would... Tonight, she allowed") and mild paraphrase loops around the core concept (editing history, revising work, unmade mistakes). The phrase "confidently uncertain" appears three times with diminishing returns. Figurative language is controlled, though "time folded like wet paper" and "starlight arrived centuries late" in the opening paragraph stack without clear progression. No opacity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines do double duty. Opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, several passages slip into scaffold: "joy at finally being witnessed, sorrow for all the years of invisibility, hope tangled with grief" paraphrases what the prior scene already showed. "She showed her how fishermen's silences held fear of storms, how children's pauses contained wonder" lists rather than dramatizes. The overnight teaching montage compresses via summary when beats would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.6)
    Information density is high; sentences often layer action, setting, and emotion. Rhythm varies appropriately (short beats during the descent, longer reflection at the portrait). Two issues pull the score down: paraphrase loops ("the world above believed she had vanished" / "the world above had already forgotten her") restate erasure without added pressure, and figurative density spikes in the final paragraphs ("volcanic heart," "grief so tender it could have melted stone") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating mild overwriting. Spatial choreography is clear, and no syntactic monotony or typos appear.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density and rhythm variation; opening establishes voice immediately. Minor paraphrase loop: "His memories had become entangled" / "his dreams remained, woven into hers" restates the fusion concept across adjacent paragraphs (−0.2). Figurative language is mostly apt ("grief made luminous") but "the universe exhaled" bookend feels slightly ornamental without strong causal linkage to Mira's action. Sentence openings vary well. No clarity or propulsion issues at closure. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing images are strong. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. A few template cadence runs appear: "Lots of people hide things here. Most of it stays hidden" and "I maintain this place" / "Then perhaps you can help me" exchange feels slightly scaffolded. Minor synonym variation in "folding and refolding" / "fold hiding a secret until you needed it." No loops touch the closure beat, so impact is contained.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies; information density is high (the dental mirror simultaneously anchors grief, profession, and method). Line-level clarity is strong, with no major loops or scaffold. Deductions: "spiralingly calm" appears twice as an unearned adverb phrase; "the darkness was courting him" and "the darkness that had whispered to her brother" abstract a concrete threat into metaphor without fresh vehicle; and "Something passed between them that words would have only diminished" is a telling summary that could be cut for tighter closure. These stack to −0.6 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structure and vivid images ("mist parted briefly," "iron remembered and mirrors caught stars"). However, several phrases verge on stock lyricism ("cradling hope like a fragile queen"), and the recurring "unspoken words" formulation becomes template-like. Information density is moderate; some beats restate Eleanor's motivation without advancing pressure. The final paragraph's repetition of "seventeen" feels mechanical. No major loops or causality-obscuring artifacts, but figurative density in reflective passages occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and key images ("dream caught between tides," "chains...detach and drift away like shed scales") are vivid. Minor loops: "guarded hearts" appears twice in close succession (scrimshaw effect, Jonas's walls); "detach" recurs (Treaty, Mira's nature, final chains) without escalating meaning each time. The phrase "combative tenderness" is declared, then illustrated (Jonas's touch "combative in its tenderness"), which reads as scaffold. Information density is generally high, and no major template cadence runs.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. "The wood surrenders its secrets" and the turbine-as-clock opener create textural specificity. Information density is high. Deduction: "The Happiness Mandate had passed three years ago, after the Great Mourning had nearly collapsed society" is backstory exposition that could be woven more tightly into present choice. "She didn't let herself acknowledge what she was carving" withholds from the reader what Mira already knows, creating brief artificiality. Filter-verb density ("she felt," "she understood") in reflective passages slightly dulls immediacy in a few lines.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and sentences carry high information density. However, decorative figurative density in non-peak beats slightly drags momentum: "cobalt geometry into a perfect mirror world," "lantern-moth hush settled around her, that particular silence that seems to breathe and flutter" are vivid but border on overwriting when combined with similar constructions in adjacent paragraphs. No loops or scaffold; clarity remains high. The final image ("cloud-shadow poet casting verses into crystalline air") maintains propulsion without muddling.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level craft is generally clean with varied syntax and strong imagery ("sky streaked with ash and amber," "small ghost"). Information density is high in the opening and closing thirds. However, the middle section contains minor scaffold: "She had prepared for this" is followed by an expository paragraph that tells rather than dramatizes her plant arrangement. "Years of negotiating with gallery owners" is summary backstory that could be cut. The "world exploded" revelation is vivid but leans slightly purple ("impossible emerald"). No major loops or template cadence, but the prose occasionally prioritizes atmospheric detail over momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; sentences layer image, action, and thematic weight (e.g., "The lens caught afternoon light and threw a spectrum across the phonograph horns"). Rhythm varies effectively between reflective beats and the propulsive final ringing. Two minor issues: "powerfully gentle in its desperation" mixes tenor awkwardly (power vs. gentleness vs. desperation), and the phrase "golden shadows" recurs three times without functional shift, trending toward motif checklist. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and advances sense.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. "After burying her daughter three months ago, she needed somewhere that didn't measure the hours since loss" is concise and layered. Information density is high in the opening third. However, the middle section recycles "They came to her" and "She taught them" stems across multiple paragraphs, creating template cadence. "Curtains of intention" appears three times, twice in the final third, risking loop. The phrase "genuinely artificial" and its variants recur without added pressure. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The final image—"coordinates folded inside like a secret promise"—is vivid but leans slightly decorative. Minor scaffold present but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies well; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively ("rain-beaded skylight loft had become Vera's sanctuary" / "the onyx cards whispered their secrets"). Information density is high; most lines do double duty (setting + character, action + theme). Two minor artifacts: "steadily curious" in paragraph four reads slightly label-like rather than dramatized, and "the body's confession before the mouth spoke a word" is near-cliché. "Onyx-ink" and "onyx deck" repeat within close proximity without reweighting. No loops or scaffold otherwise; clarity and momentum hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies adequately and information density is moderate. However, three distinct artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops ("true purification required chaos, required letting go"), template-cadence runs in the archive-description passage, and stock metaphor reliance ("breathed against her face like a lover's confession"). The phrase "atoms of nostalgia" recurs as conceptual label without evolving specificity (−0.6 cumulative). Figurative density in the opening beats (saffron-veil, bronze prism, fractured light, colors that no longer existed) approaches overwriting without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled; figurative language (petals of walls, book-branches, hope like fruit) is coherent and world-integrated. Two minor artifacts: "softly deliberate" appears three times in identical phrasing across paragraphs, and "luminous regret" is repeated verbatim. The phrase "Each evening since, she had tracked its growth" compresses transit efficiently. Information density is high; no paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary, and the final image (shadow flowing, Vera noticing the exact moment of dusk's release) carries propulsion and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, opening with longer reflective periods and tightening into shorter declaratives during the repair sequence ("By morning, she would have something new built from the ruins"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or symbolic charge. Two minor issues: "quietly vivid even in death, shifting between amber and forest green" recurs conceptually in the final third ("quietly vivid truth"), and "could not have faked the recovery of every creature, could not have sold them all" is a paraphrase loop within one beat. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Propulsion is steady through the repair sequence to the dawn resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies effectively (short crisis beats, longer reflective turns) and information density is high—most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. Opening and closing images (frosted hourglass, falling sand) bracket the arc cleanly. Two minor issues lower the score: "meteor-strike silence" and "displaced miracle" recur without deepening, risking decorative repetition; and one paraphrase loop in paragraph nine ("She spent her life learning to read them—the stories in wounds, the narratives written in damage") restates the same idea without added pressure. Apply −0.4 once in Q7 for the loop and slight figurative redundancy. No scaffold or generation artifacts harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished with strong figurative control—"seats folded shut like sleeping birds," "vines in a luminous jungle." Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor template cadence in the psychometry sequence: "Images came...," "She was preserving...," "The images shifted..." repeats stems across adjacent paragraphs. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high in the instrument discovery beat. Minor scaffold: "She knew what festered in that valley—creativity trapped like birds in amber, songs that died in throats, paintings that never escaped their imagined canvases" is a list-like construction that pauses momentum. "Remembered stardust" repeats across multiple paragraphs without added meaning. Figurative language is controlled but occasionally dense ("calcified into this machine, his desperation crystallized into brass and glass"). No major loops or template cadence; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clean with purposeful sensory detail and clear spatial choreography, but several patterns weaken momentum. Repetitive sentence stems appear in adjacent lines: "She had not dreamed... not since the last forest burned"; "Some days she'd glimpse... other times in the corner"; "The sound made her chest ache... The child looked up with eyes that contained." Template cadence runs of "She + [verb]" and "The + [noun] + [verb]" across multiple paragraphs create a drumbeat rhythm that flattens urgency. Stock metaphors ("eyes that contained too many reflections," "chest ache with something adjacent to memory") dilute specificity in key beats. Information density is strong in world-building passages (divergent archive, quantum containers, probability-paths) but scaffolding phrases like "She thought of all the versions" and exposition ("The archive existed occasionally everywhere, bleeding through wave functions") slow the closure approach.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences vary in rhythm and structure; the opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high—each paragraph advances setting, character, or theme. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is purposeful and mostly coherent. Minor issues: "the familiar ache of displacement" and "feeling the sound move through her sixth sense" edge toward vague abstraction; "serrated like ancient saws" is vivid but the simile doesn't add function. The tree-healing beat compresses complex action ("removed it carefully… inserted her talisman") without showing intermediate struggle, slightly reducing propulsion at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and features purposeful similes ("like a mother's hand on a fevered brow"), but several lines loop conceptually: "never done / never spoken / never walked" in paragraph two, and the ridgeway vignettes paraphrase the same regret-pattern without added pressure. Template cadence appears in "They walked... They saw... They crested" sequences. No major filter-verb stacks or clarity breaks, but information density is diluted by atmospheric description that stalls momentum. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the closure turn.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do double work. "Azure walls drinking in the endless white like a bruise that refused to heal" is vivid and specific. Minimal scaffolding. One minor loop: "Silent Choir" appears three times in quick succession in the third and fourth paragraphs without evolving meaning between mentions. The final image propels cleanly. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is high: most sentences advance character, world, or plot. Minor overwriting: "the breath between one celestial arrangement and the next" and "graceful collapse" recur without clear escalation. One paraphrase loop: "The library remembered everything" near the top echoes thematically later without new pressure. Figurative language ("shadow stretched...like a mourning veil," "bloomed like smoke") is coherent but dense in the opening third. No template cadence or major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or discovery). The opening simile ("creature that had forgotten how to swim") and closing image (torn edge as reminder) bracket purposefully. Minor deductions: "periodically eternal" appears three times with slight redundancy; "tapping a rhythm" recurs in similar constructions without always adding pressure; and "paths disappeared" is paraphrased across adjacent paragraphs in the middle section. No severe loops, but cumulative template cadence in the tapping-rhythm beats reduces propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and sentences open with variety. Information density is high in the opening and stone-circle beats. One paraphrase loop appears: "The lull in rebellion had transformed this place" closely echoes the prior description of the bay's transformation, though separated by sufficient beats. Figurative language is frequent ("silver rain," "monument to abandoned hope," "prehistoric heart transplanted") but mostly coherent; "thunderous serenity" is near-oxymoronic yet voice-motivated. No major template cadence or scaffold. Clarity is strong throughout. Minor deduction for figurative density approaching the high-band ceiling without full pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clear and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythm and strong sensory anchors ("steam rising," "heat embrace her arthritic bones," "volcanic glass vibrated"). Information density is high in the decoding and unsealing sequence. Two frictions: "The gift had arrived three years ago when the regime's chemical weapons scorched the valley, killing her son and poisoning the soil, but somehow awakening something dormant in her aging neural pathways" is a long summary sentence with "but somehow" hand-waving causality; the passive "had been placed" and "had spent months" lean on scaffold phrasing. The phrase "by decoding a cryptic script on the tail of an abandoned kite, Mira finally understood what she needed to do" repeats the prompt language almost verbatim, reading like a seam. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is mostly clean and propulsive with strong imagery ("salt-blasted soil," "pearl of stillness," "small vote for the future"). Information density is high; most lines do double duty. Two friction points: mild paraphrase loop in "The hawk was just a hawk. The sky held only weather" repeating the reassurance structure, and a cluster of filter verbs during the freeze beat ("She felt that warmth," "She placed," "She counted") that slightly dull immediacy. The line "everything she'd known had been reorganized into categories of before and after" is vivid but leans abstract. The final paragraph's rhythm effectively decelerates to match closure. No major loops or scaffold, but the figurative density in the opening third (rusted watering can as ghost trace, orchids as survivors) occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "books pressed spine-to-spine like passengers on a sinking vessel," "hinges corroded to green lace," "amber grief." Several metaphors in the climactic paragraph compete for attention without clear hierarchy. Paraphrase loops appear: "descended into necessary darkness" is stated twice with minimal variation; "fragmentation" recurs across adjacent beats without fresh angle. The rhetorical questions create template cadence in the opening third. Rhythm modulates well during the untangling sequence, but elevated register ("negotiation," "multiplicity") intrudes during peak realization.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences vary in structure and rhythm; paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high in the ink-stain beat, where multiple jobs (world-building, time distortion, Seren's curse) compress cleanly. However, minor scaffold appears: "She had been searching...hunting the mechanism of her curse" paraphrases the earlier hunt description without added pressure (−0.2). "Consciously wild" recurs three times as a label without fully dramatizing its cost in action. Figurative language ("frozen lightning," "cold honey") is purposeful and clear, but "serene and patient as a glacier" in a peak anger beat reads slightly overwrought. No template cadence or major loops; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high ("three thousand frozen consciousnesses," "bribes...dissidents...thawed and discarded"). No paraphrase loops. Minor issues: "dangerous liaison letter" repeated verbatim; "dizzying quiet that pressed against her eardrums" mixes metaphor slightly (quiet pressing is tactile, eardrums auditory). "The echoing library stretched around her" front-loads description mid-crisis where tighter syntax would propel. Clarity remains intact and no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop conceptually: "continuity through chaos" appears twice in near-identical form, and "patient as petals, steady as roots" at the close feels decorative rather than propulsive. Template cadence in backstory paragraphs ("He'd wanted... Instead, she'd inherited...") and minor filter-verb stacks ("seemed," "felt," "understanding that") in the soldier sequence dull immediacy. The final paragraph's stacked metaphors ("patient as petals, steady as roots, drinking deep from hidden wells") border on purple without adding causal weight. These artifacts don't obscure closure but prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, though some lines carry ornamental weight without advancing pressure: "tender and dangerous in equal measure" restates what "feral beauty" already conveyed. The phrase "something ancient turn its attention toward her" is abstract where specificity would sharpen the beat. A minor paraphrase loop appears in the rail spike description: "transliterates emotions" is explained twice in close proximity (market woman's line, then "translating her relief, her sorrow" later). The opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively, and the final image "She would fish for stars" recharges prior material. Figurative density in the goddess's appearance ("not quite human, not quite anything") and the fountain's "visible shape of sound" work under the Accumulative lens but cluster heavily in one passage.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence openings, purposeful rhythm, high information density. "Star charts covered the walls like wallpaper chosen by a madman" and "cities like circuits, roads like veins" are vivid without overwriting. One paraphrase loop: "What she wanted was understanding—specifically, understanding why" restates within two clauses. Minor filter-verb cluster in the opening third ("had inherited," "had been," "had dismissed") but not at peak beats. No major artifacts touch closure. Clarity and propulsion are solid throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm is controlled and sentences vary in structure, supporting the lyric accumulation. However, figurative density in high-pressure beats risks overwriting: "time curled back upon itself like smoke remembering flame" and "corrupted code in ancient machinery" appear within the opening setup, and "frequencies that spiraled backward through the fold" in the climax mixes metaphor vehicles (spiral motion, backward time, spatial fold) without coherent grounding. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "She had been searching… She had been drawn… She understood now why…" (three "She had/understood" stems in close succession). The final paragraph contains two near-paraphrase loops: "Some things… simply needed to be translated" and "some silences were not emptiness… but love waiting to find its proper frequency" restate the same insight. No major causality breaks, but these artifacts dull momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings avoid template runs. Figurative density is high ("breath held too long," "petrified snow," "gauze") but remains legible until the closure beat, where "spiral logic" and "lilac unease" verge on stock mystical phrasing without grounding. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; clarity holds. Filter-verb use is restrained. The mandala description ("spirals nesting within spirals, geometries that spoke") abstracts rather than concretizes the object's visual specifics, reducing information density at a key beat. Propulsion is steady but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high (each vision does multiple jobs: world-building, stakes, causality). Clear propulsion through "knelt," "gasped," "placed both metal hands," "began to carve." Minor loop: "warm coldness" appears twice with identical phrasing; "gentle radical" is repeated without reweighting. Template cadence in the fire-vision beat: "She watched... She felt... heard... witnessed" stacks filter verbs. No major artifacts touch the closure image ("letter by letter, she carved"), but the filter-verb stack in the middle third and the repeated "warm coldness" prevent higher bands. Grammar and tense are clean; no pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies effectively: short declaratives ("But tonight, something shifted") alternate with longer lyric cadences. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("shoulders curved inward like parentheses," "timeline spiraled like a tangle of silver threads"). However, scaffold and template patterns appear: "She had been... Now she was..." and "the moment before X" constructions recur. Paraphrase loop: "tragic could transform, that endings could become beginnings" and "crossroads, not endings" restate the same thematic point. The phrase "rising nostalgia" appears as a label rather than being fully dramatized through rhythm. These artifacts cluster in thematic beats and dull momentum slightly, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines doing double duty (e.g., "The sliver sat on her workbench now, catching the amber light from her wand, its layered mica sheets glittering like frozen thought" anchors object, light source, and metaphor in one move). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor tic: "the kind of woman who" construction and "correlation does not imply causation" reads slightly expository for peak interiority, though it establishes character voice. Figurative language (fractal spirals, willowglass) is consistent and purposeful. Opening and closing lines bracket the arc cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with strong sensory specificity ("pressed into shale like a letter never sent," "darkness that had existed unbroken since before her grandparents were born"). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or theme. However, paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 11–12 restate that the lights are communicating and that Vera understands their mapping attempt. Template cadence in paragraph 14 ("stayed...mapping," "giving voice") and the final paragraph's three parallel fragments ("Above her...Below her...And in her hands") read as patterned scaffold rather than urgent closure rhythm. No mixed metaphors or register drift, but density could tighten in the ending third.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high through the cataloging sequence. However, several paraphrase loops emerge: "scattered truths" appears three times in different forms, "quietly inspired" and "sat quietly inspired" echo within paragraphs, and the closing beats recycle "secrets" and "ready to become" constructions. The final third leans abstract ("possibility," "salvation," "tomorrow") without concrete imagery, flattening propulsion. Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally stacks ("canyon echo," "thread from a spool," "held breath") in close proximity. Minor template cadence in the opening beats ("she found," "she began," "she understood").

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; the opening's long, layered sentences give way to shorter beats in the sanatorium confrontation. Information density is high—scarred hands + pillbox + fire history compressed into the opening paragraph. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deductions: "Some broken things stayed broken and became beautiful in their fractures. Some needed mending. And some—the hardest category—needed to be forgiven" reads slightly scaffolded in the triadic structure, and "silver hush" appears three times, creating mild decorative echo. The final image "carrying the weight of old betrayals and new purposes, the earth tilting steadily toward spring" is strong but leans into abstract noun stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor template cadence in the opening ("He stood… He never did… He pulled") and a few stock metaphors ("fog thick as wool," "memory returning") slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure causality or closure. The final image is clean and propulsive. No paraphrase loops or significant scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies, information density is high, sentences advance. Opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor slip: "She had touched a bowl last month and felt three different versions of its making, all true, all contradicting" uses a scaffold summary where a concrete image would sharpen. The phrase "small and stubborn as a bee" in the final line risks cliché but earns it through prior bee motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (each line advances setting, memory, or gesture). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent: "hammered silver" harbor, "missing tooth" absence, "small green kingdom." One minor register drift: "instill something in that stranger" reads slightly elevated for Marina's established voice, though it anchors to the grandfather's phrase. Clarity and propulsion are strong; no scaffolding. Grammar and punctuation are clean; pronoun references unambiguous. The opening line anchors stakes and voice; the final line recharges motifs (containers, growth, endings) without overwriting. Stock phrase "protected, vulnerable" recurs three times across the piece, creating minor textural redundancy (−0.3 for pattern-artifact). High information density and zero loops otherwise; no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high—most lines advance character understanding or setting logic—though some phrases lean toward ornament ("manuscripts that arrived on mist currents and departed with the dawn"). Clarity holds throughout; spatial choreography (spiral stairs, central pool, stone circle, cloud floor) tracks cleanly. Minor figurative density in the opening paragraph ("tidal library," "ebbing and flowing," "isolation had calcified") does not obscure causality. No loops or scaffold detected. The final image ("bridge to something beautifully, impossibly alive") recharges the extinction motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and the opening/closing images bookend effectively. However, minor scaffold appears: "She understood suddenly" tells the epiphany rather than trusting the spheres to show it, and "somewhere along the path" is generic temporal vagueness. The phrase "the essential shape remained: an ascending helix, each fragment of twig supporting the next" demonstrates strong specificity, but "impossible, embarrassing, transformative loves" lists modifiers where one strong verb might suffice. No loops or filter-verb stacks harm clarity, and figurative language (spiral, vessel, thread) coheres without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, conflict, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence openings are diverse. The opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, two adjacent lines in the second paragraph ("They were tricksters, cosmic entities..." and "They were using the university's own transmitter...") repeat the structure "They were [noun phrase]" without added pressure, creating a minor paraphrase loop. The phrase "a sound that wasn't sound" borders on stock mysticism. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are strong, with strategic telling that compresses backstory efficiently. Zero major scaffold or loop artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and most sentences advance story or atmosphere. However, several passages loop or overwrite: "She was claustrophobic, yes. She was afraid of small spaces and tight corners and the feeling of walls closing in" recycles prior content without added pressure. "Spatial mutiny" appears twice as a label. The phrase "transfix the very dust motes suspended in the moonbeams" stacks modifiers where simpler prose would sharpen. Filter verbs ("felt the vibration," "thought of her grandmother") are present but voice-motivated. Clarity and propulsion hold overall, with minor density loss in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean and purposeful. Minor template cadence in the middle third ("She drew… She sketched… She understood…") and one paraphrase loop ("not closure, but witness" echoes "truth becomes a matter of architecture" without added pressure) reduce momentum slightly. The "lance-sharp" simile is vivid but isolated; no figurative muddle or heavy artifact debt touches the closure beat. Sentence variety and rhythm are competent.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the decoding beats. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The world had exiled its familiar weather, and that exile was about to end violently" echoes the earlier "reversible exile" concept without added pressure. "Nervously confident" is asserted twice (grant applications, organizing pages) without evolving. The final paragraph stacks abstract closure claims ("hope, perhaps. Or simply the satisfaction") that dull momentum rather than landing a concrete image. Minor template cadence in exposition ("three months after," "six years ago") and a thesaurus-itis slip ("spongey dread" recurs without justification) lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and image-rich, with strong metaphoric density ("pixelated amnesty," "time differently employed," "songs...faithful as the bridge"). However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence in the middle third without clear pattern-teaching, and several images mix registers ("scaffold wrap's secret semaphore," "instrument of pure air") in ways that feel decorative rather than propulsive. Minor template cadence in the final paragraphs ("This time, Margaret was the one...This time, she was the one...") and filter-verb stacks ("she knew," "she understood") dull immediacy slightly. Information density is high, but the overwriting in peak beats (the descent, the cabin reveal) blurs clarity under the −0.5 threshold for density without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening lines anchor voice and the circus train image. Information density is high in the caboose beats, efficient in the time-compressed summary. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled: "weeds consuming the tracks," "flying too close to profitable suns," "amber and shadow." Minor slips: "dissuading travelers from resistance with nothing but presence and implication" stacks abstract nouns without concrete image; "the strange arithmetic of return" in the final paragraph elevates diction beyond POV consistency. The Djibouti/franc exchange demonstrates strategic telling (compressed research into dialogue). Propulsion is strong in dramatized beats, softer in the startup summary.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high, with most sentences advancing situation or interiority. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and the opening/closing lines anchor and resolve effectively. However, several passages loop or paraphrase: "She had thought they were mere phantoms...Marcus had known otherwise" is stated then restated in the next paragraph; "the message was about shared burdens" is explained twice in successive sentences. The metaphor "scattered ink drops" contradicts the astronomical context. Minor filter-verb stacks ("began to write," "felt it now") dull immediacy in peak beats. The "gradual lightening at the horizon" passage is overwritten for the moment's needs, slowing propulsion just before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the vortex crossing and tree confrontation. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or causality. Minor loops: "The vortex screamed around her, wind tearing at her cloak" and later "the vortex began to slow" repeat the vortex anchor without new pressure; "she had fought worse storms within her own heart" is a stock metaphor. Figurative language is mostly grounded ("branches heavy with fruit that would never ripen," "spine unbend from its perpetual defensive curve"), but the opening's "apple trees spiral eternally through mist and dark water" borders purple without adding causal weight. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.3)
    Opening anchors voice and stakes effectively; final line closes with image. Sentence variety is present, though several paragraphs rely on similar expository stems ("She had spent," "She pressed," "She could see"). The phrase "purposefully curious" appears once as a label without further embodiment. Minor paraphrase loop: "The intersection emerged… Not a place, exactly, but a presence—the point where all their paths crossed" restates the same idea. Information density is solid, but the penultimate paragraph's exposition ("she finally understood why…") is scaffold that tells rather than shows. No major filter-verb stacks or template cadence; clarity and propulsion are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong with purposeful rhythm variation and high information density. Opening grounds voice and stakes cleanly. Minor issues: "fiercely gentle" appears twice in close proximity (describing voice, then describing hands/touch), creating slight echo. "Hole" recurs frequently (chest, soul, uncertainty's "own kind of hole") but serves thematic accumulation rather than pure loop. Figurative language is controlled and legible. No scaffold, template cadence, or paraphrase loopsDetected.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character and atmosphere simultaneously (e.g., "limestone quarry like a forgotten promise" economically establishes both setting and Marcus's emotional state). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through Val's entrance and breathing during Marcus's reflection. Two minor artifacts lower the score slightly: "confidently uncertain" feels like a prompt echo rather than earned paradox, and "the hollow place where stone was carved into absence" in paragraph three paraphrases the quarry imagery already established. The opening and closing lines are strong, with "morning light was just beginning to reach the quarry floor" charging the final image without over-explanation. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; clarity and propulsion remain high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong figurative density ("magnetic arbor floated above the clouds like a promise that had forgotten how to break") charges the opening but risks overwriting in a few beats. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. No loops or template cadence. Minor deduction: "kindly methodical" appears three times without functional variation, edging toward ornamental repetition. The final paragraph's syntax ("ancient as breath and new as her next heartbeat") tilts toward elevated diction but remains voice-motivated. Propulsion is steady; no scaffolding or paraphrase loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong momentum. Opening line ("The tidal atrium had no tomorrow anymore") anchors voice and stakes. Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or concept. Minor loop at closure: "The moon would shift. Her strength would change. The tides would rise and fall" repeats the cyclical pattern already established without adding pressure. Template cadence appears briefly in the penultimate paragraph ("Tomorrow might never come, but today held…" / "And that, she decided…") but does not obscure causality. Figurative language is generally coherent; "migrating identities… like watercolors left in the rain" is apt. No filter-verb stacks or major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentences carry multiple jobs (e.g., "The effect was beautiful and terrible—latent radiance trapped in stone, waiting for someone to notice" layers image, theme, and character perspective). However, several beats show template cadence and synonym drift: "She would write about them. She would crown these forgotten voices..." / "Some bunkers were meant to be unsealed. Some walls were meant to fall. / And some hopes..." stacks parallel constructions in the final third without added pressure, reading more like thematic underlining than propulsion. The paraphrase loop "abandoned hopes" / "forgotten voices" / "unspoken love" recycles the same concept. Apply −0.6 for template runs and −0.3 for loop, total −0.9 from a higher starting band.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic weight. Clarity is strong throughout. Minor issues: "She'd been so certain about the treatment center. Her chronicles had led her there..." is a paraphrase loop—both sentences restate her reliance on her method. "The medication had numbed the pain but also the possibility" borders on thesis statement. One template stem run: "She would follow... She would play... She would let..." in the penultimate paragraph, though the parallelism serves rhetorical buildup and reads intentional. No significant figurative muddle or scaffolding. The final line ("she was finally ready to let the current carry her") completes the arc with a clear image.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is often vivid—"gauze wrappings trailing behind her like captured fog," "books bound in what felt like frozen tears"—but suffers from template cadence in exposition: "She had waited... She had come... She'd noticed... Now she understood." Paraphrase loops appear ("the watch's hands moved cyclically reversed, counting backward" / "its backward cycling synchronizing"). Stock metaphors ("champagne bubbles held beneath a cork") and filter-verb stacks ("She could feel it," "seemed to brighten," "seemed to pulse") dull momentum in high-pressure beats. The cipher explanation mid-story reads as scaffolding that stalls discovery rhythm. Sentence openings repeat pronominal stems across paragraphs without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; imagery is vivid and dense ("dark liquid settle," "ice dust," "mulberry ache"). Minor scaffold appears: "They answered in the language of growth and patient seasons" is abstract where a concrete image would sharpen. "Propagate across distances that should have been impossible" tells mechanism rather than showing propagation's effects. Figurative language is heavy but mostly coherent; no major loops or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, elevated figurative language clusters in the middle section without clear payoff ("veins of living light," "gossamer boundary," "cosmic background"). Two adjacent sentences near the climax restate urgency without added pressure ("minutes before oblivion" / "diminishing… perhaps minutes"). Template cadence in the closing paragraph ("knowing that… reminded her… that her work") mildly flattens propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is generally high. However, several figurative constructions drift toward overwriting: "the vineyard hush of dusk," "cloudstuff," "the desperate movements of souls too wounded to stay." The phrase "kindly decisive" appears twice as a descriptor without dramatized tension between the two traits. A minor paraphrase loop occurs in the opening paragraph (moss-covered stones / ancient grove / gnarled trunks) that could tighten. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is mostly clean and rhythmically varied, with strong images (hollow mirror, wind chimes, spiral staircase). However, several decorative loops appear: "sincerely insincere in the way all professionals of moral commerce must be" is followed by a near-paraphrase two paragraphs later; "This was her method" and "This was her protected vulnerability" use template stems. Filter verbs ("recognized," "observed") stack in dialogue beats without voice motivation. The final third contains figurative density ("ribbons of cloud," "tide through sand") that does not obscure closure but slows momentum slightly. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, −0.3 for filter-verb stack.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clear, propulsive, and information-dense. Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are distinct. The pool demonstration sequence is concise and visually precise. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor deductions: "the strange grief of youth, emotions growing rawer" edges toward告 tell where embodied detail could sharpen, and "crossed the threshold—her pupils widened" uses a dash where stronger syntax could integrate the sign. Figurative language is controlled and coherent throughout. Overall strong line-level craft with no artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)
    Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, paraphrase loops appear: "layer upon patient layer" echoed by "patient accumulation"; "dust had become her second skin" restated as "centuries of layered dust" within the same sentence. Template cadence emerges in repeated "she had learned" constructions across paragraphs two and three. Figurative density is high ("monuments to great leviathans," "wind's memory, earth's dreaming, sky's intention") without clear pattern-teaching, approaching overwriting in the middle third. Information density is strong when grounded in action (the birds' formations spelling response) but thins during reflective exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high in the garden sequence. Figurative language is vivid and mostly coherent. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "light that persisted beyond its source, beauty that outlasted reason" restates the same idea across adjacent clauses; "accommodates impossibilities... accommodates dreamers" loops within a single beat. The final section stacks abstract declarations ("No trophy... no proof... But her fingertips glowed") in a way that dilutes propulsion. Template-cadence penalty (−0.4) for repetitive "She + past-tense verb" stems in the closing paragraphs: "She had found... She was still... She had climbed..."

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively; the opening's compressed syntax ("Tonight, the pier stood dark. Tonight, he had a different purpose.") contrasts with the longer, layered sentences in the library. Information density is high: most lines advance discovery, memory, or atmosphere without redundancy. The phrase "meteor hush" and "luminous vows" carry specificity without strain. However, a minor paraphrase loop appears in paragraph five: "She'd always done that" immediately follows the prior paragraph's revelation about hiding behind truth, restating rather than advancing. The scaffold phrase "he realized" recurs twice in close proximity. These issues are contained to the middle third and do not touch the closure beats, so penalties remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic resonance. Minor scaffold present: "The backwards prophecy had found her" and "The backwards prophecy promised this" function as near-synonym anchors; "cast lots decision maker" and "chance-divination" restate the same concept adjacently in paragraph three. Figurative language ("ambered," "cosmic inhalation," coins as "threads of collapsed possibility") is dense but coherent and serves the Accumulative design. No loops touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Sea monsters writhed in the illustrated depths" establishes both object and thematic link). Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer sentences during reflection and shorter beats during the crystallization turn. Two minor loops: "incomplete" and "unfinished" cycle through adjacent paragraphs in the middle third without added pressure; "echo" appears in title, character trait, and mid-story summary, creating slight redundancy. The closure image ("small glass menagerie of fears finally named") lands cleanly with no artifacts. Overall propulsion is strong, though the middle reflection on sacrifice could compress slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is largely clean with strong imagery ("frozen river of gemstone," "seventeen years of accumulated quiet, thick as honey"). Information density is high and momentum advances steadily through the ritual. Minor issues: "dripping rates" and "cosmic current" recur without much variation, creating slight conceptual redundancy. "The drip began. Silence leaked out; sound leaked in" reads template-like in cadence. The opening's figurative density ("frozen river," "blue fire," "shards") is heavy but coherent. No loops or major scaffold, though a few lines ("Everything in the cosmos leaked, flowed, transferred") edge toward summary. Overall propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong concrete images (copper tubes, cobblestone streets, sapphire-hued label). However, multiple figurative phrases cluster without pattern payoff: "bones from ancient earth," "violet grip," "mirrored hush" (used twice), "spin all these fragmented images into shared meaning." The phrase "precisely humane" recurs as a thematic flag rather than organic narration. Two adjacent paragraphs beginning "The" create minor template cadence. Stock metaphor "breath before the first word" in the penultimate paragraph dulls momentum. Overwriting in high-pressure beats (the revelation moment) applies −0.5; recurring elevated diction adds −0.3; total deduction ~−0.8 from a baseline ~7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory details are vivid (kaleidoscopic spray, chiming leaves, black ribbon of starlings). Information density is high in the opening and closing thirds. However, the middle section contains paraphrase loops: "She had spent her entire career trying to harmonize logic and intuition, to prove that the heart's knowing and the mind's calculating were not enemies but dance partners" restates the story's premise without new pressure, and the transformation paragraph stacks abstract constructions ("felt her analytical mind expanding," "felt the equations...interlace," "felt the touch of wonder move") in a template cadence that dulls immediacy. The peak beat relies on elevated metaphor where concrete embodiment would serve closure better. One clarity issue: "She cupped her hands around the crystal and began to flame it with her breath, not fire but something older" uses "flame" as a verb ambiguously.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and aural texture. Information density is high—most lines advance situation, character, or atmosphere. Two friction points: "After the radio static clears, she thought, I will know" reads as future-tense framing that the narrative then ignores, creating a small scaffold seam. The phrase "like a soundless echo, reverberating with implications she could feel but not hear" is figuratively strained (an echo is already sound; "soundless echo" contradicts itself and then the line repeats the concept with "could feel but not hear"). These don't obscure causality but introduce momentary opacity in high-pressure beats. No loops or template cadence; proofreading clean.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity is high; no loops or pronoun fog. Information density is uneven—opening paragraphs layer vivid images (floating dojo, churning void, brain jar) but midpoint beats paraphrase theme ("You are both trying to defeat emotional numbness" restates what prior dialogue dramatized). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She had survived that death, emerged from it like a snake shedding skin, and now she could slice through pretense with a single glance") without pattern-teaching. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, figurative language clusters densely without always earning its keep: "throat that had forgotten how to swallow," "stones," "wound," "calcified," "sleeping child" stack metaphors in service of similar emotional work. Paraphrase loop: "some things couldn't be written. They had to be unmade" restates the maceration premise already established. The opening "hourglass had finally emptied" recurs at closure, but the repetition reads mechanical rather than reweighted. Minor pronoun ambiguity: "something that had been clenched" lacks a clear antecedent. Line-level artifacts prevent entry to 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Opening and closing images are strong. Minor loop detected: "The garden had kept Maren suspended for seventeen years" near the end restates information already established, adding only the "preparing her for this moment" gloss. A few figurative constructions in the opening ("breathed mist like a sleeping beast," "water closing over a stone") approach density without quite tipping into muddle, but the accumulation slows the first-beat momentum slightly. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; clarity and propulsion remain solid overall.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (each line advances setting, process, or stakes). Clarity is strong throughout, with no orientation or sequencing errors. Minor artifacts: "the weight of seventeen failed transmutations in her hollowed chest" leans purple without full payoff; "sacred" appears five times across 800 words, creating slight lexical echo; "dying light," "freezing air," and "frozen bloom" form a cold/death motif cluster that borders on template patterning. The approximation scene avoids scaffold, moving cleanly from formula to metal response to adjustment. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks detected.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level craft is generally strong with varied syntax and high information density. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor scaffold issues: "She was a celestial signal interpreter by trade, one of the few who..." front-loads exposition without immediate pressure; "Her motivation was simple, though others called it paradoxical" tells rather than dramatizes. Paraphrase loop near climax: "what came through was not sound but texture" followed by "Within that silence, she heard everything" restates the paradox without adding pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in middle: "She removed... She reversed... She stripped..." runs three identical stems without taught pattern (−0.4). "Serenely electric" appears twice (platform, dark) without functional shift. No figurative muddle, grammar clean, momentum generally propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; lines do multiple jobs (the hourglass both seeds backstory and drives closure). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Minor artifacts: "somehow" appears twice as a causality hedge; "the moment when clocks run sideways and destinations become theoretical" leans slightly abstract for the established voice. The final paragraph's parallel structure ("other ferries, other grottoes, other souls") feels template-cadenced but serves closure. No loops or major scaffolding. Clarity remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. Minor loop: "realistically imaginary" appears identically in two contexts without reweighting between uses. Template cadence in the mirror-room paragraph: "They showed...had absorbed...had wandered...had left...had become" stacks past-perfect constructions. One metaphor strain: "erupt into multiplicity" uses explosive imagery for what's actually a static reveal in mirrors. Propulsion is generally strong, though the penultimate paragraph's three sequential "The" openers create brief monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    Syntax varies purposefully; the opening anchors voice and stakes. Information density is high—most lines do two jobs (e.g., "corroded and barnacle-scarred" conveys both age and Vara's old anchoring). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction: paragraph nine ("She thought of her students…") slightly over-explains what the prior image already conveys, and "All of it suddenly felt like teaching someone to paint by numbers" borders on cliché metaphor. Figurative language in high-pressure beats (edge geometry sequence) remains coherent and serves perception. Propulsion is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings avoid template runs. Information density is high in the setup (sanatorium history, Vera's method, Margaret's backstory compressed efficiently). Minor scaffold: "She was persistently curious by nature, which made her both effective and lonely" tells rather than shows the trait under pressure. The phrase "the thread between the sisters finally complete its circuit" mixes metaphors (thread/circuit). No loops or paraphrase cycles. Opening line anchors stakes and voice; final line recycles "listening" motif without fresh charge. Figurative language is controlled but occasionally stacks: "fog pooled like spilled milk," "edges had gone soft as cloth," "hush deepened, reeling into something sacred" within close proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (e.g., "The undersea cables had carried more than data; they'd carried voices, last words, pleas…"). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Two minor artifacts: "that particular silence that wasn't silence at all but the weight of an ocean holding its breath" stacks modifiers at a peak beat, and "proved that someone, finally, had returned" delivers the thematic thesis slightly on the nose. The codex description ("painstakingly applied, decorated the borders…like medieval monks") lingers without adding pressure. Propulsion is steady; the ascent paragraph compresses transit efficiently. Clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, the piece carries noticeable scaffold and paraphrase loops: "She needed those failures back" directly after explaining the digital ghost; "This was midnight solace" tells what the prior paragraph showed; "fetched what she came for" in the penultimate paragraph is repeated by "walked out...carrying her failures" two paragraphs later. Figurative language clusters densely in the ink-pattern sequence without always clarifying the mechanics. Stock phrase "carrying her failures like lanterns" in the final line dulls an otherwise strong ending. Deduction: −0.8 for loops and density lapses, plus −0.3 for template phrasing in closure vicinity.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence variety is strong, and imagery is vivid ("frozen screams," "dark vein spreading like roots through crystal"). Information density is high in the setup and climax. Two issues: mild paraphrase loop in the middle (birds as algorithms is stated, then restated as "patterns…shapes of forgotten phonemes"); and a subtle template cadence in the resolution paragraph ("The death of the language had taken three centuries. Its resurrection had taken one afternoon. But the true work lay ahead")—three parallel declarations that flatten momentum. No major clarity breaks, but these accumulate to −0.6 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot), and clarity remains strong throughout. However, a paraphrase loop appears in the opening: "The underground garden breathed" is effectively restated by "its luminescent herbs" and the seasonal defiance, creating mild redundancy. A second loop occurs late: "something was growing" followed immediately by "Hope...was a hardy plant" restates the metaphor. Stock metaphor ("turn it into a cosmic joke") and the somewhat mechanical final-paragraph articulation ("Hope, she decided...") slightly dull momentum at closure. No major scaffold or template cadence, but these minor artifacts prevent entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in action beats. However, the piece carries noticeable scaffold: "She had always known this moment would come" is a stock phrase; "The question was whether she would..." is an and-then connector. The cicada explanation ("The cicada had not fought its shell. It had simply become too vast to be contained. Mira understood now.") is a three-line paraphrase loop stating the same insight. Figurative language is dense ("resonantly soft," "tarnished wonder," "silence they had planted in your throat") but mostly coherent. The loop and stock phrasing cluster in the middle third, dulling momentum before the climax. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loop and template stems ("She had," "The statue").

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence-level craft is competent with varied syntax and clear causality. However, paraphrase loops appear: "disputed territory" is restated multiple times without added detail; "linking absences" recurs without evolving mechanics. Figurative density is high ("cathedral of forgotten games," "cosmic ledger," "stitched response") without pattern-teaching, creating mild register drift in peak beats. The closing paragraph stacks three metaphors (ghost/promises/healing) that blur rather than sharpen. Filter verbs ("watched," "listening") appear but don't stack disruptively. Information density is good; momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies effectively, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several phrases border on purple: "misting hush," "whispering gleam," "quietly persistent" recur without evolving, creating a lyric loop. "Sacred geometry of incomplete things" and "spaces where new songs waited to be born" veer into abstraction during peak beats. The final paragraph's anaphoric "He would… He would…" structure is purposeful but risks template cadence. Minor paraphrase loop: "silence transformed" is stated twice in близких forms within the closing beats. Information density is high overall, but figurative load occasionally dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally, sentences open diversely, and information density is high (wax cylinders spinning without phonographs, punch cards casting shadow-odes). However, a paraphrase loop appears: "certain hours held better light" / "some knowledge requires inconvenient timing" restates the same idea within the opening paragraph. The phrase "observed solitude" recurs three times without additional pressure or detail, risking synonym churn. "The place where stories live" is invoked four times across the piece, functional for motif but edging toward template. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors mar peak beats, and the final image (scarf wound tighter, notebook open) propels cleanly. Cumulative artifact penalty: −0.4 for paraphrase loop plus repetitive stems, keeping the score under 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is generally strong, but several lines loop conceptually: "remained distant, remained gone" and "almost, almost name" repeat structure for effect, which succeeds. Minor scaffold: "The dream kept running, and she kept losing pieces" and "earning strange refractions, beautiful but meaningless" use template stems. "Luminous" appears seven times, risking overuse but remaining coherent to the central metaphor. The fog-breakthrough paragraph delivers high density without clutter. Figurative language is controlled except "blade of gold cutting the mist," which verges on stock. Copy is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense: "time… dripping from the edges of starlight like honey from a broken comb," "symbols shifted and rearranged." Information density is high. However, overwriting clusters in the opening: "enigmatic in the way that water is enigmatic" is a paraphrase loop, and elevated register ("across the hush of cosmic possibility," "enveloped secrets of existence itself") risks ornament over propulsion. The final third accelerates cleanly. Template stems appear: "Mira had…" opens multiple sentences in the backstory block. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loop, register drift in peak lyric beats, and template cadence; no artifact touches closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively: short declaratives ("She unscrewed the lid") punctuate longer lyric accumulations. Information density is high—most lines advance both atmosphere and plot (e.g., "The shipwrecks surrounding this place had carried crews who navigated by those same stars" links setting to method). Minor template cadence in the opening paragraph ("the sound of her grandmother's voice disappeared, then the recipe...then the lullabies, then everything else") is purposeful list-making, not scaffold. No loops or mixed metaphors touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high, though some beats carry mild redundancy: "The afternoon shadow caught in glass seemed to pulse with judgment" is vivid but slightly over-written given the prior paperweight description. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph's triple "every day" construction, applying −0.3. The tea-leaf analysis paragraph integrates exposition cleanly without stalling momentum. A few stock phrases ("throat tighten," "years, nested like") and the phrase "armor" versus "comfort" border on abstraction but remain anchored in scene. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, mixing longer accumulative passages with short declarative beats ("He stayed." "Marek smiled."). Minimal loops: "wonder" recurs frequently but serves thematic purpose rather than synonym churn. One template pattern appears in the middle section: "He would [verb]" structures cluster without taught pattern, causing brief drag. Information density is high in the opening and closing thirds; the middle "gathering essence" sequence could compress slightly. The final paragraph propels cleanly without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: "gathering it like dust in the hollow spaces where her craft used to live" delivers specificity and metaphor in one move. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the sanctuary's geometry shifts are imagistically clear. Two deductions: "interlaced hush" and "lucid unrest" are repeated as near-synonyms without added pressure (paraphrase loop), and "Her edges grew softer, less defined by guilt, more defined by acceptance" is a tell-heavy summary of Callum's transformation rather than an embodied image. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but the middle third carries slight decorative density.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, evidence, or stake. Rhythm varies well, and sentence openings are diverse. Two paraphrase loops appear: "The painted saints watched" echoes earlier "saints... on the curved ceiling" without added pressure, and "seemed to" recurs three times in close proximity ("seemed to shift," "seemed to turn," "seemed... to reach") creating mild scaffold. The line "Unless they had. Unless decades of silence had changed them" delivers effective compression. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but the cumulative minor loops reduce propulsion slightly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer contemplative passages yielding to shorter beats during the discovery. Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Minor loop detected: "She thought of…" repeats four times in the penultimate section, creating a mild template cadence. The opening and closing lines anchor effectively. One instance of elevated diction ("the profound sadness of drowned words") that borders on purple but remains voice-motivated. No major clarity issues, but the metaphoric density in the reflection passages risks slight overwriting without full payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (ghost's origin, graffiti system, grandmother's craft). The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor scaffold appears: "The ghost had found her three months ago" transitions efficiently but "appearing first as static" then "whispered numbers" then "coordinates" reads slightly list-like. The phrase "driftingly alert awareness" repeats effectively. Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed vehicle: "tinkersong wonder—that quality of discovery mixed with careful crafting, like a clockmaker finding unexpected beauty in gears"—the clockmaker simile feels explanatory rather than integral. No loops or severe artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and most lines advance character, atmosphere, or discovery. Figurative language ("grief is merely joy wearing a heavier coat," light "scattered and reformed") is purposeful and thematically charged. However, several beats exhibit template cadence and paraphrase loops: "She had been a servant...but today marked her final ascent" recaps setup; "She understood now why she had spent seven years" summarizes rather than dramatizing the realization; "Now she recognized it as the same affectionate detachment her mother had written about" loops the prior paragraph's insight. The ending risks overwriting with "something luminous and alive" and "her mother's spirit smiled" softening the image's concreteness. Proofreading is clean; grammar and tense are consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, with short technical notations punctuating longer reflective passages. Information density is high—nearly every line advances understanding of Elena's state or method. The opening grounds immediately; the closing image charges prior material. Minor texture issues: "dusty starlight" appears three times, creating slight echo; "the string broke" as metaphor for tether feels compressed on first mention. No major loops or scaffold, though "empty spaces remember" recurs as both father's theory and final realization without quite enough transformation between instances.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and often propulsive; information density is high in the coin-decoding and manuscript-discovery beats. Figurative language ("fractally precise," "suspended breath between existence and absence," "limits were not prisons but doorways") suits the accumulative lens but clusters heavily in the final third, risking slight overwriting. Minimal loops; one paraphrase near the end ("the strange freedom of experiencing a world unmapped by others' expectations" echoes earlier interiority). Sentence openings vary, and the final image ("carrying its secrets in her hands, feeling the coin's ancient indentations press against her palm like a heartbeat, like a message, like a map") is rhythmically controlled. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic variation. Information density is high—most lines advance discovery, setting, or character. Figurative language (starlings "like ink dissolving in water," luminance "like breath from cold lips") is purposeful and spaced. Two minor issues: "The ship creaked and whispered, a constant companion" leans slightly generic; "charts that would change everything explorers thought they knew" tells future impact rather than showing present charge. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity and propulsion remain strong through the accumulative build. Grammar and punctuation are clean; no pronoun drift or tense inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery ("frozen library floated above the clouds like a memory refusing to dissolve"), but several passages loop conceptually: the mentor's lesson about repair appears three times with minor variations, and "driftwood nostalgia" recurs as a phrase without evolving function. Metaphor density is high throughout ("frost bloomed," "cold grew teeth," "dawn breaking over frozen mountains") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff—not all figurative language advances pressure. The phrase "hauntingly bright" appears twice in close proximity. Sentence openings vary well, and the read-aloud rhythm mostly propels, but the final paragraph's stacked abstractions ("not about restoration but transformation, not about return but continuation") become sermonic rather than trusting image.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong. Two pattern artifacts lower the score: (1) Synonym loops—"strangers who had become her family" (para 1) / "strangers had transformed into home" (final para); "peace, Elara had learned, required tending" / "his quiet work of tending"; (2) Template-cadence stems cluster in the middle: "He had seen...He had simply nodded...he had understood...his altruism was not...his distance not." Additionally, the phrase "nebula of respite, a pocket of peace carved from displacement" stacks near-synonyms without added pressure. These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats; apply −0.6 in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and figurative language ("sentinel watching over the hush," "pane of hush") mostly lands without muddle. Two issues lower the score: paraphrase loops ("she had spent decades adjusting" / "she had spent a lifetime calculating") and template stems in the reflective passages ("She wanted…" / "She understood…"). The phrase "beautifully flawed" recurs three times without evolving meaning, reading as prompt-echo rather than organic motif. Mechanical construction: "Before the first clock struck its warning. Before Mira learned…" uses parallel structure without pressure payoff. No filter-verb stacks or major line-level opacity, but cumulative scaffold prevents entry to high band.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: information density is high, no paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected, and figurative language (copper warnings, ghostly light, graceless beauty) serves pressure without overwriting. Sentence rhythm varies naturally and propels the rescue sequence. Minor deduction: "bitter and strange," "darkness, one glowing mark at a time," and "emptiness, bare trees and stone houses" edge toward paired modifier stacks that slightly slow momentum. The opening and closing images are vivid and resonant. Grammar, tense, and spatial choreography remain clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "Separation was not erasure. Connection persisted in ways that transcended physical proximity" restates the same insight without added pressure. The phrase "divergent path" appears three times with similar framing. Template cadence emerges in the final section: "She had created something… She understood now… She had finally learned…" The figurative language mostly lands cleanly, though "loosened grief" and "grief loosens its grip finger by finger" feel slightly labored. Applying −0.6 for loops and template stems, though they don't obscure the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in the opening third (parole bracelet, floating library, clean slate vendor establishing in ~150 words). Two minor loops: "mindfully scattered" appears twice in close proximity describing the moonlight's behavior; "the place where stories begin" recurs three times without functional variation. One scaffold phrase: "Everything here was glass—the trees, the walls, the tables" reads list-like when integrated description would maintain momentum. Figurative language is controlled and grounded (clouds "like slow thoughts," "cream dissolving in coffee") with no mixed metaphors. Propulsion remains steady through peak beats; the child's arrival and slate-touching advance pressure without stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance. "The desert fortress after rain became something almost alive, its stone walls weeping moisture that wouldn't last the afternoon" compresses setting and time pressure efficiently. Stock metaphor: "like ink into water" for emotional bleed is generic. Minor paraphrase loop: "the pavilion wanted to subsume her remorse, to absorb her mother's guilt" restates in adjacent clauses without new pressure. "At the close of an unspoken dream" is striking but the follow-up explanation ("that liminal hour when...") dilutes the image with scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is largely clean with varied syntax and purposeful sensory detail. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "bridges from silos… acoustic ones—pathways of sound that connected structures built for isolation" restates the same concept across adjacent clauses. Template cadence in the greeting sequence ("Dobry wieczor… Buenas noches… Guten Abend…") is intentional and voice-motivated, so no deduction. Stock metaphor "invisible threads" and the phrase "vigorous tender" (attribute forced into prose) slightly dull momentum. Apply −0.6 for loops and mixed register in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is technically clean with varied syntax and vivid imagery, but suffers from pervasive overwriting and figurative density that obscures momentum. Phrases like "canyon walls rose like calcified memories," "helix-minded engineer," "chaotically precise movements," and "quaking reverie" stack metaphorical language without breathing room or earned escalation. Paraphrase loops appear: "abandoned dreams" recurs seven times; "helix/helical" appears three times in early paragraphs. Several sentences restate content without added pressure—"She was not here to remember. She was here to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams" versus the prior paragraph's explanation. Template cadence in reflective passages ("She understood now why…"; "Perhaps that was…"; "Perhaps all dreams were…") creates rhythmic monotony. The final third's philosophical summary mode ("By dawn, Vera would emerge transformed…") deflates propulsion rather than charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and purposeful with strong information density: most sentences advance setting, character perception, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally and paragraph structure creates visual breathing room. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Two text-pattern issues lower the score: "clandestinely luminous" appears twice in identical phrasing (manuscript and final doodle), reading as a recurrence that constrains choice but also as mild synonym avoidance when "phosphorescence" was already introduced. The phrase "threshold effects" and "prism-minded" each appear multiple times, approaching template cadence without full pattern-teaching. No paraphrase loops or major scaffold, but the figurative density ("dreamlike," "petrified snakes," "luminescent milk") clusters heavily in the inversion beat withoutmuddling clarity. Slight passive construction in "had been gardeners of secrets" where active voice would tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere. Opening and closing images are strong. Minor issues: "The silence remained, intensely quiet, profound as prayer" stacks near-synonyms, and "refusing to let the music die completely" is a touch abstract for a high-pressure beat. "Sympathy bloomed inside her bones" should be "bloomed in her bones" for tighter idiom. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong images: "twilight painted the sky in bruised violets," "basalt absorbed the twilight rather than reflecting it." Information density is high in the opening third. However, paraphrase loops appear: "translating silence into understanding" / "translating silence into connection," and "thoughtfully precise" recurs as a label without fresh dramatization. Template cadence in the middle ("She began translating... She pulled out... She pressed her thumb...") and the phrase "Before the next phase... After the next phase" create mechanical symmetry. No filter-verb stacks or register drift, but the loops touch non-closure beats and lower momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and the opening line anchors voice well. Information density is generally high, though the final third loops thematic content: "silence was merely the space where understanding waited to be born" closely paraphrases earlier material about tuning and listening. Several lines exhibit register drift into abstract philosophizing ("quantum physics," "ultraviolet range of human feeling") that sits awkwardly with concrete workshop detail. Filter verbs ("seemed to warm," "felt remarkably like") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. The phrase "imagination... was simply reality wearing a different costume" is a strained metaphor that obscures more than it clarifies. Paraphrase loops in the final two paragraphs (empathy as practice, love as attention) trigger a −0.4 deduction for redundancy touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is controlled—"frozen dancers," "heavy as a promise"—without overwriting. Minor template cadence in the middle: "She recorded... She smelled... She sat..." clusters slightly but does not loop. The final paragraph modulates well. Proofreading is clean. One small hedge: "something darker—decay wrapped in sweetness" could be tighter. No major scaffold or paraphrase loops. Propulsion is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with varied syntax. "Whirling silence" recurs purposefully. Minor template cadence in the opening beats: "She was an intrepid orchard pilot… Her small vessel… For three years, Maren had searched…" uses similar declarative stems. The phrase "hope, and that hope had seeped into the soil, into the roots, into the very stones" shows slight paraphrase loop (hope → hope). Information density is high; no major loops touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, balancing longer analytical passages with terse observations. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor scaffold appears in "She thought of Vasquez... She thought of her father"—a template stem that could tighten. The metaphor "containers funneled and compressed the air like the chambers of a vast, metal heart" is vivid but borders on overwrought for the established register. Opening and closing lines anchor well. No loops or paraphrase cycles that dull momentum. Overall clarity and propulsion are strong with only hairline slips in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, several phrases lean toward overwriting: "synesthetically blessed, a condition that had made her childhood unbearable and her adulthood extraordinary" is expository scaffold; "oscillating repose" and "certify wonder as essential" read as imported abstractions rather than organic to the moment. Minor paraphrase loop: "silence could become stagnation. Wonder required awakening" restates the same idea. The closure beat—"Wonder, she knew now, had never needed certification"—doubles back on the motivation statement with near-identical phrasing. These slips dull momentum but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or causality. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor issues: "avalanchingly quiet" is a strained coinage that momentarily obscures sense, and the phrase "the beautiful discord that held worlds apart" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward elevated abstraction during a key moment. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly; the final image ("potential") recharges the earlier silence motif. Proofreading is clean, and spatial choreography tracks without error.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lyric and image-dense with strong figurative control ("sky hemorrhaging light," "stretched thin as hammered gold"). Minor overwriting cluster: "loss multiplied by memory, divided by time's cruel asymptote" followed by adjacent metaphorical constructions in the same beat slightly reduces propulsion. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph stacks metaphors ("intersection of loss and wonder," "transposed emotion") without pause, creating slight density drag. Information load is high but clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but leans into decorative phrasing: "spine of ancient stone," "rheumy eyes sharp with something," "fade from memory to myth." Some paraphrase loops appear—"not to deliver wonder, but to coax wonder from the routine, to transform the mundane passage" restates the same idea. Template cadence in paragraph nine: "What had been X was becoming Y" repeats twice in quick succession. Information density is uneven; the seven-monastery summary compresses efficiently, but the final two paragraphs stack abstract declarations ("not just duty anymore, but devotion. Not just transport, but transformation") without adding new causal detail. No severe artifacts touch closure, but cumulative decorative weight and parallel construction in peak moments apply −0.6 total.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is largely clean with vivid images: "crystalline skeleton," "frost-covered window," "accumulated love." Rhythm varies appropriately, and no major loops or scaffolding appear. Information density is high in the frost-reading beat. However, some lines trend purple: "silence relocated, as if sound had merely stepped into another room" is elegant but slows momentum. "Truthful lies that contained more honesty than any fact" borders on contradictory without grounding. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; no artifacts touch closure. Minor register drift in elevated passages.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentences range from short ("Now Mei would recommence the work") to long, accretive constructions. Information density is high in backstory passages but thins slightly during the ritual description. Minor loops: "something like letters, something like a map, something like a love note" is effective parallelism, but "stoically sparkling" appears twice with identical phrasing, the second instance feeling decorative. "The raveling silence reversed, began to knit itself back together" is vivid. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "threads of silence" and "unspooling meaning" work together. Some filter verbs ("could feel the orchard remembering") soften immediacy. Overall momentum is steady, though the final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, but several scaffold patterns weaken momentum. The opening uses effective concrete images ("gravity-defying stone arches," "iridescence that reminded him of the azure sky"), but mid-story exposition slips into summary loops: "For three days, Oren navigated by touch..." followed by similar constructions. The phrase "This quiet man who moved deliberately" in the penultimate paragraph echoes earlier "moved deliberately, each footstep considered" without added pressure—mild paraphrase loop. Filter verbs ("seemed to lean," "reminded him") appear but don't stack densely enough to trigger the stacking penalty. The thematic close ("resilience isn't found. / It's forged") reads as elevated summary rather than image, dulling the final beat's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense with strong opening and closing images. Sentence structure supports momentum and no loops or scaffold appear. Figurative language is controlled ("reality felt thin as membrane," "cathedral to obsolescence") and enhances rather than obscures. Minor texture note: "the weight of the withheld truth" recurs as a thematic phrase and borders on abstraction, but the surrounding concrete detail (shard pressed to heart, stepping into rift) keeps clarity high.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, and information density is high (each paragraph advances understanding or pressure). No loops or scaffold. Clarity is maintained through the cairn sequence and letter reading. Deductions: "luminescent weight," "warmly observant," "haunted lantern room" cluster stock adjective phrases; "the particular quality of silence that settles into abandoned places" is generic; "grew heavy in her pocket" is a bodily cliché. These slip into the 7.2–7.9 band but do not obscure closure, so no artifact cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and vivid ("Green light erupted through the lens, fragmenting into a thousand emerald arrows"). However, multiple lines loop conceptually: "otherworldly routine" appears three times, "ancient shadows" recurs without added pressure, and phrases like "as she always did" and "as they always did" stack template cadence across adjacent paragraphs. The prophetic declarations ("The eastern shores will need rain by Thursday...a child will be born...") feel ornamental, not propulsive. Figurative language is dense but controlled; no major clarity breaks. Information density is moderate; some beats (kneeling, positioning the wick) advance setup without complicating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but three issues accumulate. Template cadence: "She believed / She spent / She would / She pressed" runs across multiple beats without taught pattern. Stock phrasing: "ancient witnesses, patient and wondering" and "borrowed life" feel ornamental. Paraphrase loop: the dye master's explanation of Mei-Lin's gift ("She never raised her voice… But she would ask one small question") is immediately restated ("It was her gift and her burden") without added pressure. The confession beat's clarity and the final image's lyricism prevent deeper harm, but these artifacts blunt line-level propulsion in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the assembly sequence. Two minor loops: "The trees had taken it, held it, kept it safe" and "Not stolen. Witnessed." restate without added pressure, costing ~−0.2. One template run: "The cypress dreamed... The oak dreamed... The willow dreamed..." spans three beats but serves patterned catalog, so penalty is light. Figurative language ("starlight," "moonlight like water") supports tone without muddling. Sentence openings vary. No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean with strong propulsion and vivid images. Paraphrase loop in opening: "Her memories scattered like seeds in wind, fragments of faces and names drifting beyond her grasp" restates the same idea in adjacent clauses without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in middle section: "She saw figures… their hands… their voices…" runs a parallel structure without variation (−0.4). No figurative muddle or major artifacts at closure. Information density is high; momentum is sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "I thought I was hiding" / "Perhaps. Or perhaps you were learning a different kind of presence" restates without advancing; "She was still hiding. She was also finally found" loops conceptually. Template cadence in the opening ("After her daughter's death—a preventable accident, a moment of distraction, her distraction") and figurative density in reflective beats ("like stones surfacing in still water," "enlarged tranquility," "lanterns through darkness") slow momentum without clear pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density ("She noticed when the bakery on Chrysanthemum Street vanished overnight, though her neighbors insisted it had never existed"). Sentence openings vary, and rhythm modulates well from reflective opening to the kinetic final planting. Minor scaffold appears in "This was her method of uncloaking the disappeared: through guerrilla gardening," which tells rather than shows the method in action earlier. The phrase "heuristically gentle" recurs as a label without embodied demonstration of trial-and-error gentleness in a high-pressure beat. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language (spider's geometry, bread's ghost) is precise and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies appropriately; sentence openings shift; information density is high. However, figurative language clusters heavily in several beats without always advancing pressure: "luminous dust," "luminescent dust," "magnificent sunrise," "colors that had no names" stack metaphorical description in the dissolution sequence. "Gently meticulous" recurs as a phrase-loop across paragraphs. The quartz/crystal/frost imagery, while thematically coherent, borders on overwriting in the opening third. Clarity remains intact, but density occasionally substitutes for propulsion. Apply −0.6 for figurative density and phrase recycling touching multiple beats but not obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in action beats, though the opening paragraph stacks three metaphors in quick succession ("captured stars," "crescents in her skin," "sharks in these underground waters") without clear pattern-teaching. The watch fob anchors recur across beats but edge toward synonym churn—"lucky charm," "tiny anchor," "brass pieces," "prayer"—without each instance adding pressure. No loops or scaffold mar the closure beat, and grammar is clean. Propulsion is steady but the interception sequence compresses key action into summary ("she was already gone") where a micro-beat of evasion would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("doubt had dismantled a hundred false prophets," "chemical campaigns through root and soil," "sorrow so pure it made her eyes water"), but the metaphoric load appears in nearly every sentence, risking overwriting. Sentence openings vary, and information density is high. However, minor loops appear: "carrying" and "convergence" recur without reweighting, and phrases like "emergent compass," "terrestrially cosmic," and "futuristic nostalgia" are introduced, glossed, then reprised without deepening. The final paragraph stacks abstract images ("petrichor and possibility," "bright as copper, vast as the space between stars") that blur rather than sharpen the closure. No major scaffold or template cadence, but the cumulative figurative density in peak beats reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clean and propulsive. Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Minor artifacts: "charcoal-fingered hands trailing" and "charcoal still beneath her fingernails" repeat the charcoal cue without added pressure; "like a gallery, like a confession, like a promise" stacks three similes where one would suffice. "Uncorked creativity" is a minor stock metaphor. No paraphrase loops or severe scaffold, but figurative density in the final third slightly slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the setup (greenhouse domes, oasis drying, mother's letter, postal fragment). The metaphor "soap bubbles refusing to burst" and "a cathedral of magnetic tape" are vivid and coherent. However, scaffold phrases appear: "She turned back," "Now she sat surrounded," "The journey took six hours"—these are functional but template-like. The phrase "completed by the listening" in the final paragraph is elevated but borders on abstract philosophizing. No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks, and the closure image (gilding the Archive entrance) is concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clear and propulsive, with strong image-making ("cloud sea," "weeping slow tears of prehistoric water"). Several lines loop or paraphrase: "something in its bronze had shifted, some molecular arrangement" restates without adding pressure; "each peal felt like blasphemy, like promises broken before they could be made" doubles metaphor. Template cadence appears in the climax: "The monks emerged… drawn by… Maren watched… watched wonder bloom…" cycles "watched" within adjacent beats. Figurative language is dense in high-pressure moments ("symphony of truth," "language older than words") where concrete action would sharpen impact. Information density is high overall, but these artifacts dull the closure beat's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense. Sentence variety supports rhythm: short declaratives during the burn ("The box caught. Paper curled and blackened."), longer syntactic waves at closure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled and earns its place ("memory refusing to fade," "universe clearing its throat," "containing their chaos inside herself"). Minor deduction: "strangely organic" appears twice within short span (opening and final third), and "fragmented wholeness" in the penultimate paragraph risks overwriting at a peak beat. The closure image ("turned with them") is clean and propulsive. One scaffold phrase: "And VERA-7 began her morning rituals again" slightly flattens momentum before recovery. No other line-level artifacts touch pressure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean with strong rhythm control and sensory specificity ("morning dew on the iron benches," "her thumbnail finding a hidden catch"). Minor scaffold: "The courtyard held its breath" and "The courtyard exhaled" frame the piece symmetrically but risk cliché. The phrase "She leads her life far from here" and "leads their guilt like a dog on a leash" reuse the verb "lead" awkwardly within proximity. One paraphrase loop: "made pain speakable, shareable, lighter" followed immediately by "she had been drawn to this work, this place, this particular morning" stacks declarative rhythm without propulsion. No major line-level artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structures and vivid images ("breathed with the patience of forgotten things," "movements deliberate as a spider spinning its web"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor loop: "encrypted" and variations appear eight times, creating slight synonym churn around the core concept. The metaphor "each step a measured placement that disturbed neither the silence nor the sediment" is precise, but "like snow" on sediment is a small tonal mismatch (snow melts; sediment persists). No major line-level opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (each paragraph advances character, plot, or atmosphere). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language (silver fire, moon's edge smile, sea glass transparency) is vivid but deployed judiciously. Minor artifact: "fluctuated mysteriously" / "fluctuation" appears three times as a stock descriptor without fresh angle, and "silence gleamed" recurs twice in near-identical construction, creating minor template echo. The final line ("leaving the salt chamber's silence gleaming behind her") elegantly closes the image loop but relies on the repeated phrase. Propulsion is strong; no momentum drag. Overall craft is clean with hairline repetition in peak descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmically controlled, but several passages suffer from decorative density that slows momentum without adding causal pressure. "The sensation was terrestrially cosmic, grounding her in soil and stone even as it connected her to the vast machinery of celestial movement" stacks modifiers and abstract nouns where concrete action would sharpen the beat. Synonym loops appear: "hushed"/"hush"/"stillness"/"silence" cycle without functional variation, and scaffold phrases ("she knew," "she had discovered," "she needed") recur. The ritual sequence, which should anchor the climax, reads as extended summary rather than beat-by-beat propulsion, reducing information density and dimming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer contemplative sentences balanced by short declaratives ("The building hummed its goodbye"). Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the teaching relationship. Two minor artifacts: "She had been a tutor of dead languages in life, Sanskrit and Sumerian and tongues that had crumbled" reads slightly list-like, and "like heirlooms, like secrets, like the borrowed sweetness" triple-stacks similes at closure. Otherwise no loops or scaffolding; clarity and momentum remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. The night-long recitation beat ("She spoke through the night, through the slow rotation of constellations") builds momentum through repetition and accumulation. However, several template cadences appear: "She had been… she had discovered… she had learned" stacks across the opening third, and "the shell…" opens three consecutive sentences mid-story. The phrase "tragically radiant" recurs twice without evolving meaning. Stock constructions ("like water off stone," "like a bell") and elevated diction ("ghostly resolve," "borrowed starlight") cluster in peak beats, slightly obscuring concrete sensory grounding. No paraphrase loops or causality-breaking artifacts touch the closure, limiting the deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is largely clear and purposeful, with strong concrete nouns ("stalactites," "heritage rose thorn," "wax") and vivid images. However, several lines loop or restate without adding pressure: "The signature emerged perfect, indistinguishable from genuine, because in every way that mattered, it was genuine" is close to a paraphrase of the prior paragraph's claim that the act is "completion" not "deception." Template cadence appears in the final third: "The aurora dimmed... Veren extinguished... walked toward... leaving behind..." reads as a list rather than propulsion. Minor figurative density ("pearl twilight," "calcified," "chains of another kind") is consistent but borders on ornamental in non-peak beats. Apply −0.6 for the loop and template run, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance knowledge or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing lines frame the arc well. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "They were not blessed or cursed. They were being harvested" restates the seashell's revelation without adding pressure; "the webs of intrigue stretched back generations, a conspiracy of silence" recycles "webs of intrigue" from the second paragraph without new stakes. The phrase "something like hunger, something like loss" in the penultimate paragraph is a template-cadence construction. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence. No artifacts touch the closure beat itself, which remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and image-rich. Information density is high: most sentences advance setting, character knowledge, or thematic resonance. Minor scaffold appears: "someone who descended into sunken vessels not for gold but for voices" is functional exposition but slightly over-explanatory for the established tone. The phrase "weaves truth carefully, knowing that exposure demanded precision" reads as meta-commentary inserted mid-flow, creating a small momentum dip. No loops, synonym churn, or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled and consistent (ice/memory, light/borrowed, windows/connection) without mixed metaphors. One participial ambiguity: "their light borrowed starlight reflected through frozen depths" compresses syntax nearly to opacity, though context rescues meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences vary in rhythm and structure, information density is high (the whisk serves memory, measurement, and communion), and no paraphrase loops appear. The opening gargoyle image anchors voice immediately. However, "scintillatingly somber" and "infinitesimal lanterns" push toward purple territory without clear voice motivation, and the phrase "beauty that ached because it acknowledged how much of the world's grace went unwitnessed" edges into abstraction during a high-pressure beat. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly throughout the ascent, observation, and descent.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines advance discovery or atmosphere. Strong specific images: "a fracture ran through its center like a frozen lightning bolt, and within that fracture, something shimmered that wasn't quite light." Some minor scaffolding appears: "She was a conspiracy debunker by trade, or had been" followed immediately by restating her current identity, and "The comfortable lie here was obvious" then explains what should emerge from context. The final paragraph's "comfortable lie" / "excavate that truth" construction recycles the opening phrasing mechanically. No major loops or register breaks that obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is strong and most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language ("forgotten god's monocle," "woman made of weather and regret") sharpens without muddle. Clarity holds through complex shifts. Significant weakness: multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs flatten momentum. "Loneliness was a condition rather than a calling" / "loneliness had never been about the absence of others" restates across distant paragraphs. "The faithful were gathering…campfires visible…constellations of belief" / "watched the first campfires below begin to move" recycles imagery. Several filter-verb stacks ("had climbed," "had been," "had taught") dull immediacy in reflective passages. These artifacts don't touch closure but spread across the piece, triggering accumulated deduction and preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with strong opening and closing images. However, several beats carry decorative density without advancing pressure: "patient architecture of storms," "translate between generations," "stories that nothing could wash away." The maritime code revelation is recounted in summary rather than shown. Minor template cadence in the middle section ("He sat up...reached for...played the tune...wrote it all down"). Information density is uneven; the backstory block summarizes rather than compresses strategically.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The opening anchors voice and stakes effectively. Clarity issues: "fleshly ethereal" appears twice without clear integration into the action (Q3 credited its atmospheric use; here it reads as ornamental repetition). Minor paraphrase loop: "She had perhaps twenty minutes before full dark" is closely echoed by "The golden sunset was already fleeting, its warmth fading into violet." A few stock metaphors ("each heartbeat a drum," "ripples") and a template-cadence run in the middle section (three consecutive sentences beginning with "She" + verb). No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but cumulative minor slips prevent higher scoring. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high in the viaduct discovery and magnetic-storm mechanics. Minor overwriting appears: "softly purposeful" recurs three times, "patient revolution" five times, creating mild semantic churn. The phrase "restless patience" borders on oxymoron without clarifying the tension. No major loops or scaffold, but figurative language (leviathan ribs, pale fire, invisible work) clusters without always advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. The opening line anchors setting and stakes cleanly. However, several passages show decorative layering without pressure advancement: "watchfully calm precision," "fortified vulnerability she had cultivated," "that careful balance of openness and self-protection" recycle similar concepts. The phrase "entangled memories hit her like a flood" immediately undercut by clinical correction creates a paraphrase loop. Multiple abstract constructions ("the way history pressed," "millions of lives moving through tunnels") stack figurative language in non-peak beats, reducing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; strong verbs and concrete nouns dominate. "Vibrant hush" and "light...like paintings of mercy" risk purple but stay controlled. One paraphrase loop: "apology without action is just noise" / "turn it into something real" restates the same content adjacently (−0.2). "Aptly deliberate precision" in Ruth's introduction feels slightly forced as attribute integration. Information density is high; no major scaffolding. The storm-cloud sequence telegraphs symbolism but remains imagistic rather than expository.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high (workshop setting, kaleidoscope function, arrow-tip purpose) without bloat. Some decorative layering in early description ("drunk philosopher contemplating existence," "mathematical hunger embedded in...foundations") inflates texture without advancing pressure, though it establishes tone. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. "Throughout the evolution" recurs purposefully as a pattern-taught refrain. Figurative language is controlled and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm, and information density is high in the investigation sections. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "deleted files go" / "where deleted files never really went anywhere" and the extended explanation of shadow profiles and surveillance apparatus covers the same ground twice. Template cadence emerges in the final third with repeated "She found/She had/She would" stems across multiple paragraphs. The metaphor "stars...burning like distant servers" works, but "sensed absence that had defined her work here crystallized into certainty" adds abstraction where a concrete image would sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies (opening's long lyric line vs. terse dialogue). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("shadows... like chains," "compass pointing toward every act of mercy yet to come"). One mixed vehicle: "glimpses" as both visual memory and borrowed light threads blur the mechanics. Sentence stems vary; no paraphrase loops. The closing metaphor stack (shadows as hounds, crystal as compass, lighthouse beam sweeping) layers without contradiction but approaches overwriting in the final paragraph. Information density is high; momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and carries high information density in many lines. Figurative language is vivid ("cathedral of blue ice," "grief without being anchored to it"). However, template-cadence and paraphrase loops appear: "She had come here to end something. Instead, she had found herself suspended" echoes the opening frame without adding pressure. Several adjacent paragraphs restate Maren's loosened grip and the volunteers' patience in near-synonym fashion. The phrase "windborne solace" appears twice without evolving. Deduction: −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems touching the closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; opening lines establish atmosphere without stalling. Information density is high (fragment contains three syllables; Sofia's grandmother returned once). Two small loops: "destined mismatches" appears three times, becoming label-like; "amber" recurs seven times in 1,600 words, exceeding functional need. Figurative language is dense but controlled—"lantern holding its breath," "slow arithmetic of falling leaves"—though the vine-as-hands metaphor in paragraph two competes with later graft imagery. No grammatical errors; sentence structures vary. Minor scaffold in "that particular stillness of someone accustomed to listening" (generic descriptor).

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high—nearly every line advances character, world, or pressure. Clarity and concision are strong; no paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor elevations in diction ("kinetic parapet," "consecrate," "whisperfield calm") fit the established voice without jarring. One small simultaneity slip: "spoke the old words while the prophet's followers hesitated" compresses timeline slightly, but does not obscure causality. Zero pronoun ambiguity; spatial choreography tracks across all moves.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph structure supports turns. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "grief was a kind of cartography, a landscape people wandered" is restated conceptually in "the silence" paragraph; "vines climbed" recurs three times without functional variation (opening, mid-story, final). Template cadence in the visitor sequence ("Viktor… Old Mrs. Castellan…") reads slightly mechanical. No filter-verb stacks, no register drift, clarity is maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines doing double duty (e.g., the chandelier salvage both establishes the crystal and shows Elara's isolation). However, several template-cadence runs appear: "This was why she stayed. This was why she had refused evacuation..." and minor paraphrase loops like "The crystal did not simply reflect sound; it splintered language..." followed by near-restatement in the next paragraph. The phrase "weathered innocence that believed knowledge could solve anything" repeats with slight variation later ("That innocence had aged but never quite departed"), which reads as synonym churn. Figurative language (language grows like trees, crystal as testimony) is purposeful and coherent, but the density of abstract philosophical reflection in the middle third slows momentum slightly. No clarity-breaking artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines ("Each piece...creating a path" / "The method felt right") that restate without added pressure, triggering −0.2. Figurative language is purposeful (fog as living things, time as unwatched videotapes) without muddle. No loops or template cadence runs in peak beats. Propulsion is steady through the chalk-drawing sequence to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clear with strong concrete images (spinning clock hand, silver leaves, fractured shadows). However, several lines rely on template cadence ("It was," "She found," "She had") and near-paraphrase loops appear in the father's backstory exposition. The phrase "changelessly constant" recurs as descriptor without evolving function. Some figurative language verges on overwriting ("prayer frozen in stone," "galaxy of motion in miniature") without pattern-teaching. The closure beat is clean, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and syntax supports scene needs; the kintsugi sequence is tightly paced, and sensory detail (gold-tinted adhesive, light through cracks) is specific. However, several phrases lean into abstraction or near-cliché: "pulsing stillness" recurs without fresh embodiment, "the scent of hope" is asserted rather than shown, and "somehow transformed it into prayer" hedges with "somehow." Minor paraphrase loop: "I broke my father's record" / "You were angry" / "I was terrified" restates emotional state across three beats without added pressure. No major artifacts touch closure, but density could tighten in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening hook ("spoons had bent three days ago, curling in on themselves like dying leaves") is strong. Clarity is generally high, though "relearn" in "She had spent weeks learning to relearn" is awkward phrasing. Minor template cadence in the automaton sequence: "From the floor rose…Its eyes were dark glass…Something that remembered…" uses parallel inversion that reads slightly mechanical. No major loops or scaffold, but information density could be tighter—several beats (automaton unfolding, Mira's practice weeks) are told where dramatization would add pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, discovery, or thematic charge. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Sentence openings vary purposefully. Minor scaffold appears in "She thought of her mother... She thought of Charlotte... And she thought of herself" parallelism, though this reads as intentional tricolon rather than artifact. The figurative language ("cleft in certainty," "turn mistakes into constellations," "fortress against wonder") is dense but mostly coherent and tied to Eleanor's voice. One mixed metaphor: "turn sorrow into stars" follows "constellations of evidence" closely, risking vehicle confusion. Clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the polishing sequence. Information density is high: most lines advance memory, atmosphere, or the spiral's construction. Minor deductions: "reflectively vibrant" (para 4) is slightly strained; "zephyr bloom" metaphor feels ornamental rather than weight-bearing; the "pearl of stillness" phrase borders on purple without full embodiment. The closing mist image is precise and earns its resonance. No loops or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high (moss pattern explained via drip lines, pendant symbolism reweighted, setting interwoven with reflection). Sentence openings vary. Minor scaffold: "This was how she worked: quietly proactive" could be cut; "honeyed hush" recurs three times with slight redundancy. The phrase "protected vulnerability" in the final third feels slightly imposed rather than emergent. No loops or major artifacts touch closure, so non-closure cap applies (−0.4 for minor tell/redundancy).

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is lyric and controlled: "mist breathed through the feral nexus," "compressed whispers," "bioluminescent jellyfish." Rhythm modulates effectively between descriptive passages and confrontation beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Each abandoned when the characters began speaking truths she wasn't ready to write" is restated as "she'd abandoned each novel at the moment her characters began to hope" (−0.2). Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary, and the spiral motif is deployed with purpose rather than ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is strong; most lines advance situation or atmosphere. Minor scaffold: "The vines were dying" as a one-sentence paragraph feels like a structural signpost rather than organic perception, and "I know. I know what you need" is a paraphrase loop. "Ancient and renewed" in the final section is stock phrasing. The closure beat is clean with no artifacts touching it. Figurative language (harvest moon as "pale ghost," green spreading "like blood returning to cold limbs") is vivid and coherent with no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is vivid ("crater walls rose around her like cupped palms," "frost scattered from her lips like released spirits"). Information density is high; nearly every line advances ritual or setting. Two minor slips: "Her motivation had seemed mad when she'd first conceived it" is scaffolding that could be cut, and "deliberate patience of someone who had learned that rushing destroyed everything" paraphrases the opening demonstration. No loops touch closure; clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance world-logic, character motive, or thematic layering without padding. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declarative "The timer was essential" after longer accumulative sentences). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is selective and coherent: "season hung suspended," "voices emerged like bubbles rising through deep water," "stone womb." Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges motifs (marble, mechanism, memory). Minor deduction: "cellar of reason where one could store wonder" and "to capture mystery without killing it" repeat the same conceptual content across adjacent beats in paragraph three, a small loop that could tighten. Otherwise exemplary momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual breath. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, and the weaving process. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting: "boundary-lessly trapped within her gift" and "calcifying, yes, but not into paralysis. Into structure. Into edges" carry slight figurative density without muddle. "The earth remembered how to breathe" is a stock metaphor but doesn't recur. Clarity remains strong throughout; the weaving sequence and final exchange are propulsive and concrete. Zero scaffolding or synonym churn. Strong line-level control with one minor register lift at the opening that doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse; information density is high with most lines doing double duty (e.g., "the loft held that same hue—weathered brick walls, copper pipes greening with age" gives setting and tone). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. However, figurative language clusters in several high-pressure beats without full payoff: "time does not heal, it crystallizes" and "nothing truly disappears, it only changes form" are polished but edge toward overwriting in proximity. Stock metaphor "rust and amber" recurs without transformation. "Here and gone" functions as a refrain but its fourth appearance ("here and gone between one breath and the next") feels decorative rather than pressure-adding. Apply −0.5 for density of metaphor in reflective passages that slightly dulls momentum, preventing 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (camera wheel description does three jobs). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity is consistent. Slight overwriting in the ghost's first line: "eyes that still believed the carousel would spin forever" is elevated but stays voice-coherent. The "fractured stillness" phrase in paragraph ~10 reads slightly purple against surrounding pragmatic texture but doesn't obscure causality. Propulsion is strong through dialogue beats.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is high in technical passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "terminal's bones were sound" echoed by "basic architecture" and "existing infrastructure"; "maze of intentions" repeated conceptually across multiple paragraphs. The phrase "functionally creative" appears twice without clear evolution. Filter verbs ("could hear," "wanted to understand") stack in a few lines. These patterns don't obscure closure but dull propulsion in middle beats. Deduct −0.6 for loops and template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph structure serves emotional beats. Information density is high in the closure sequence. However, several template-cadence patterns appear: "She had come...She had been seventeen...She had abandoned...She had buried" stacks identical stems across four non-adjacent sentences, and "The forecourt whispered...The acoustics had been...The enchantment...The manuscript...The clock tower...The head astronomer...The forecourt whispered...The patterns...The notes...The crystal forecourt...The introverted clock scribe" opens thirteen sentences with "The [noun]," creating a drumbeat that flattens propulsion in the middle third. Minor paraphrase loop: "dreams do not die when we abandon them" in grandmother's dialogue is immediately followed by "she had abandoned it when the Silencing came...buried her composer's heart," restating abandonment without added pressure. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum. No figurative muddle in peak beats; metaphors (tears as rain, oil on water, glaciers) are coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Time reveals what intention conceals" primes both the sundial motif and thematic question). Clarity remains strong through the retrieval sequence. Two minor frictions: "serene upheaval" and "thoughtfully clear" appear as stock intensifiers in the final third without full dramatization, and the phrase "hindsight clarity was a cruel gift, but it was clarity nonetheless" loops conceptually. These artifacts approach but do not obscure the closure image. No Template-cadence or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance understanding or atmosphere. Rhythm modulates well between patient decoding and the standing-departure beat. Two line-level issues: paraphrase loop at "The secret weavers were not gone. They had simply hidden themselves" restates the same content without added pressure (−0.2). Template-cadence stems across four sequential paragraphs beginning "The [noun]" in the final third dull momentum slightly (−0.4). Figurative language ("philosophical arguments made tangible," "island of worn wood suspended in gray nothing") is controlled and voice-appropriate, avoiding overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is vivid and information-dense: "maple leaves the color of dried blood and persimmons left too long in the sun." Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language generally serves the moment. However, several lines approach overwriting: "lonesome splendor of autumn itself, beautiful and aching, the kind of glory that exists only in ending" stacks modifiers in a high-emotion beat. "Explained absences falling into the patient earth" in the final line risks symbolic convenience. Minor template cadence in the closing paragraphs: "Someone might find them. Someone might understand. // She kept the thread... // The garden held..." Each paragraph opens with a similar declarative stem. No severe loops, but density occasionally tips toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively: "Let them whisper. They did not understand" provides short, defiant beats against longer descriptive passages. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Minor template cadence in the middle ("The shell's crystalline structure, the faint warmth...the way it seemed") where three parallel observations stack without fresh syntax, but this does not touch closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. The opening ("hung like a frozen tear") and closing ("swayed like a living heart") bookend with purposeful images. One figurative muddle: "dying starlight" on an eggshell strains plausibility but remains poetic rather than obscuring.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is strong, with varied sentence lengths and vivid concrete detail (obsidian walls, red thread, melted glass). However, several lines loop thematically without advancing pressure: "Each piece had witnessed destruction. Each piece was learning a new song" is paraphrase churn (−0.2). "Gracefully alert" appears twice in close proximity as a label without differentiated action (−0.3). Template cadence in the therapy/sculpture paragraph ("She called it… Mara called it…") adds minor drag (−0.2). Information density is high elsewhere, but these artifacts cluster enough to prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally strong. However, several passages show template cadence and paraphrase loops: "The task required sidereal patience" is immediately followed by a restatement defining it; "She was realistically imaginative" is a label without dramatization; "dried fountain basins" and "crystallized recollections" repeat the same concept. The figurative language is mostly coherent but occasionally stacks ("silent sentinels," "brushstrokes frozen on gray canvas") without clear payoff. Propulsion is solid in the middle third but slackens slightly in the exposition-heavy opening and the tidy closing paragraph. No major artifacts obscure the closure, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or concept. However, runs of template cadence appear: "She understood...," "She began...," "She watched...," "She resumed..." across key beats, triggering the −0.4 stem-repetition penalty. One paraphrase loop: "The troubling serenity of the garden pressed against her thoughts" in paragraph three echoes "troubling serenity remained" near the end without added pressure. Figurative language is dense but controlled; one muddle: "streams of gentle radiance" after "dissolving" strains the vehicle. Clarity and propulsion remain strong overall, but artifacts at closure beats prevent entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong propulsion in opening (iron bones/glass tears/monarchs) and closure sketch. Information density is high—most lines advance understanding or atmosphere. Two minor loops: "Thomas Marsh had been dead for forty years" is restated as fact without adding pressure, and "shape of grief" recurs three times in similar phrasing. The "thundering calm" phrase (prompt element) lands once as forced elevation. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Rhythm modulates well under meditative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    Syntax varies cleanly; figurative language is dense but coherent (obsidian as blade, fog as breath, pendulum as indifferent judge). Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances ritual, guilt, or the inscriptions' discovery. Minor overwriting: "searing reverie" in the penultimate paragraph and "fractals of amber and blood" in the opener edge toward decorative in a high-band piece. No loops or scaffolding; momentum is strong. The carving beat is crisp and propulsive, anchoring the climax without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong concrete details (brass sovereign case, frayed threads, cobalt paint). However, multiple sentences begin with "The" or "Her grandmother," creating mild template cadence. "Velveteen gloom" and "uncharted echoes" appear multiple times without evolving meaning, trending toward motif repetition rather than charged recurrence. The phrase "tenderly organized" in the sovereign case description and "tenderly" in the opening feel like unintentional echo. No major loops or clarity breaks, but cumulative minor artifacts prevent higher entry.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high across most beats. The opening image—"obsidian spire rose from the frozen lake like a black tooth"—anchors voice and stakes effectively. Two patterns generate minor debt: (1) paragraph-opening stems recur ("She did not," "She would not," "She approached"), creating template cadence across the middle third; (2) several reflective blocks restate core concepts with slight variation ("ignorance cartographer," "admitting uncertainty," "honest way to work") without advancing pressure. The closure paragraph is clean and propulsive. No loops obscure causality or dull the final image, so deductions remain within-band. Clarity and concision are strong overall, with occasional scaffolding in the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the broadcast mechanics (dial adjustment, frequency sweep, three-note Beethoven signal). One loop appears: "dust was learning to speak again" in mid-story and "The dust had learned to speak" near the end paraphrase without added pressure. A second template-cadence run: "In the village... In the port town..." constructions mechanically cycle examples. "Story famine" and "Silence Decrees" are established early and reused efficiently. Clarity remains high throughout; no major figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively ("She mixed... She stepped... The mask grew warm") and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "partial flowers, half-formed birds" describes the mask while seeding the incompleteness motif). Minor loop: "her grandmother had taught her" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs. One register slip: "somber marvel" and "crystallize this fleeting emotion" edge slightly above Marina's otherwise grounded voice. No template cadence; figurative language (vanishing point pulsing "like a heartbeat remembered") remains coherent and spaced.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity is generally strong, and spatial choreography through the tunnels is coherent. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "competing narratives" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure; "agonize" and its synonyms recur; the final three paragraphs repeat the preservation-as-rebellion idea. Template cadence in places: "He [verb]" stems in the descent sequence. Figurative language is spare and functional, but information density dips in reflective passages that rehash prior points.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high ("a generation caught between, fluent in neither her grandmother's tongue nor her grandchildren's indifference"). Opening and closing lines anchor well. Minor loop: "stopped coming / stopped mattering" and "heritage, craft, the hours" structure repeats within the first third. One metaphor stretch: "silence that pressed against the library's oak shelves like accumulated grief" stacks two vehicles without full coherence. No scaffold or generation artifacts detectable.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative language is vivid and mostly coherent ("ribcage," "iron bones," "liquid knowledge"), though "bleeding orange" mixes metaphors (bones don't bleed rust). Information density is high in the opening and middle, but the climax sequence includes paraphrase loops: "The seed cracked open. What emerged was no ordinary seedling" restates rather than advances. Template cadence appears in "She would carry… She would create…" The final beat clarity is strong, and no major scaffold obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final image recharges the star-emergence motif. Information density is high in the descent sequence (phosphorescent moss, old terminals, mechanical bees synchronizing). Paraphrase risk: "She preserved wonder in routine, finding meaning in each tally mark" and later "preserving the wonder that lived in the space between storms" loop conceptually. Template-stem cluster in paragraph three: "She had," "She could," "She had been," "She had carried"—four filter-verb frames in close succession flatten immediacy. Stock metaphor: "truth demanded release," "honesty spilling from her like water through broken glass." Minor syntactic monotony in the middle third with repeated "The woman [verb]" / "Mira [verb]" beats. Proofreading clean; no grammar breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is vivid ("gap-toothed with foreclosures," "streetlight pooled like honey"). However, paraphrase loops appear: the paragraph beginning "This was why some houses died..." restates the prior realization without adding pressure. Template cadence: "She'd spent three months documenting... trying to understand..." and "She sat... She rose and walked... She carried..." create a scaffolded feel in key transitions. Closure image is clear but the reflection-heavy final third dulls propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is largely clean with strong imagery ("foxglove-stained glass," "collapsed archway," "tiny creatures had made homes in the statue's carved hair"). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during revelation beats and slowing for reflection. Two artifacts lower the score: the phrase "Such grief there" and "Such terrible certainty" uses identical stems in adjacent lines (−0.4), and "cascading revelations began then, each one building upon the last" is scaffolding that could be cut (−0.2). The final image is strong and propulsive. Information density is high throughout, and most sentences do multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Rhythm varies and accelerates during the crack discovery. However, several lines exhibit mild overwriting: "terrible, generous way" and "beautiful asymmetry" lean decorative, and "the texture she'd captured hummed in her equations, perpetual and painful and precious" stacks modifiers in the closure beat, slightly dulling immediacy. The phrase "balancedly daring" in paragraph five is awkward and reads as prompt-insertion. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs four and five both explain her project without adding pressure. No fatal artifacts, but figurative density in emotional beats (especially final third) accumulates to −0.6 range.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are distinct. Information density is high in the opening third. Two minor artifacts: "the way her grandmother had been, believing" is a filter stack, and "the familiar drift begin" + "daydreams came only under moonlight" paraphrase adjacent content. The closure paragraph ("Some languages are never truly lost") edges into theme summary but remains imagistic enough to avoid heavy penalty. No loops or scaffold elsewhere; figurative language is coherent and sparse in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies well; sentence openings avoid algorithmic patterns, and paragraph lengths create visual momentum. Information density is high: "the displaced persons of Valtora Grotto had learned to measure time by his absences" compresses backstory efficiently. Minor figurative overwriting appears: "dissolving into something they could no longer hold" and "rescuing dying arts from the throat of oblivion" are elevated but remain voice-coherent. One paraphrase loop: "the waterfall thundered its endless song" near the end echoes "the waterfall's roar had become a kind of silence" at the open without added pressure. Propulsion stays clean through the teaching sequence, though the final paragraph's clause-stacking ("historically oriented toward a past it refused to surrender and a future it stubbornly insisted on creating") slightly slows the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clean with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. The opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Minor loop: "backwards" and "counter-clockwise" recur frequently without escalating pressure. Stock metaphor: "tide pools holding the last breath of retreating water" and "vertebrae" for rocks are vivid but not fresh. The closure image ("pulled through a door") is functional but borders on abstract when a concrete sensory detail would sharpen the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is ambitious with strong figurative density ("fear so complete it had nested in her chest like a living thing," "voice threading through her ears like silk made of spider legs"). Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports beats. However, overwriting appears in multiple high-pressure lines: the advisor's teeth "seemed to exist in too many dimensions," his breath "carrying the scent of forgotten flowers rotting in cemetery soil"—vivid but occasionally prioritizing texture over momentum. Minor template cadence: "She should have been disgusted. She was disgusted. Yet she..." The final image is clean and propulsive. Information density is high, though some scaffold appears ("technically dead for seven minutes" supplies exactness that doesn't alter choice). No major loops, but figurative density in nearly every sentence of the confrontation beat trends decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with strong figurative language ("roots tangled into the salt-worn wood like desperate fingers"). However, density of metaphor in consecutive sentences (clouds as sermon, rough draft, fractal signatures) creates slight muddle in the opening third. Minor paraphrase loop: "dubbing them into her floating instrument, turning grief into resonance" repeats the transformation idea without added pressure. Sentence openings vary well; clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean and propulsive with strong information density: most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short urgency at the climb, longer reflection earlier). Minor loop: "dread" appears in three separate contexts (beneath warmth, as tone descriptor, in final paragraph) without functional variation—risks synonym churn. The figurative language ("sun pressed down like a weight," "water runs upward") is mostly clear, though "crack in the world" is abstracter than surrounding detail. No grammatical errors or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean and purposeful with strong rhythm and varied syntax. The opening line anchors stakes effectively; the final snow image resonates. Minor scaffold detected: "She had waited six months" / "watching the bush through cracked windows" / "convinced that only after its last bloom surrendered" cycles through restatement without added pressure. The phrase "noble lie" recurs five times across the piece, useful thematically but approaching formula. Information density is high; no major loops or filter-verb stacks. Line-level clarity is strong; the piece reads aloud well.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("bones of something magnificent and dead," "drowning crown"). Some mild overwriting: "stoically sensitive to every ripple that marked absence" stacks modifiers; "hushed blaze that burned quietly but never extinguished" contains a near-redundancy (hushed/quietly). Template cadence appears in the closure: "For now, it was enough to wrest them... to trace the patterns... and to believe..." (parallel infinitive stems). Minor scaffold: "She understood that she would never know" followed by "That was the nature of her chosen work" paraphrases the same idea. No loops touch the closure image directly.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high in the ledger discovery beat. However, template cadence appears in the final third: "She returned to her desk, readjusted her lamp, and began the patient work…" echoes earlier "readjust" beats without adding pressure. Minor filter-verb stacking ("feeling the grooves," "understanding now") in reflective passages slightly dulls immediacy. No paraphrase loops; clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The piece avoids major loops, though "the shadow" and "the lantern" recur as subjects across many consecutive sentences in the climax without varying structure. Minor template cadence in the ending: "Grief had become light, loss had become presence, and a crafty lantern maker had built..." stacks parallel constructions that feel mechanical. One paraphrase loop: "transform unbearable weight" / "transformation was complete" restates theme without adding pressure. No clarity-obscuring artifacts at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high—most sentences advance character, setting, or theme simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully: short declarative "Breakers cooled. Systems online" accelerates the tempo, while longer sentences ("Now she sought another awakening, one she could control") breathe with Yara's reflection. No loops or scaffold. Minor density issue: "She would continue the hunt tomorrow, and the day after, for as long as the station remained aloft" is a future-tense summary that slightly deflates the charged present of the closure moment, and "Not for vengeance, not for closure" uses negation where positive assertion would be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and mechanism beats. The phrase "perpetually surprised expression she now wore whenever she looked at the sky" recurs almost verbatim later ("her voice perpetually surprised even now"), a paraphrase loop that adds no new pressure. Minor filter-verb reliance ("seemed carved," "had been waiting") is voice-consistent and does not dull immediacy. The final paragraph compresses forward momentum into a summary cadence, telescoping the walk to the next observatory without scene grounding. No major scaffold or register drift, but the closure beat loses propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with good sensory specificity ("sieved hush," "driftwood accumulated in silver piles"). However, several loops and near-paraprase clusters: "weight of unspoken words" → "withheld truth" → "swallowed her confession like a stone" recycle the same concept across three paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence in the backstory block ("She had believed... She had never told... She had not asked") creates rhythmic monotony. The carved hand description is vivid and propulsive, and the final paragraph avoids overwriting, but mid-story scaffold weakens momentum. Deduct −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template stems that don't touch closure but accumulate through the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths shift with pressure. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Spatial choreography (fifteen paces, opposite stairwells, crossing prisoners) is clean. Minor texture note: "furrowed hush" mixes registers slightly (furrowed is visual/tactile, hush aural) but the oddity is brief and does not obscure the beat. The final image ("Until we did") recharges prior material without scaffold or overwriting. Zero line-level artifacts in the closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do double duty. Rhythm varies naturally—short sentences at peak beats ("Today, she was here."), longer accumulative ones during reflection. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges "carried" from earlier beats. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated: fog as "old grief finding its way home," faith as "candle in wind." Minor scaffold: "She had thought carrying it was punishment. Now she wondered if it was simply memory" restates without added pressure; "The gap between those two" could name "heart and action" for tighter reference. No loops or template cadence. Pronoun references remain clear throughout. One metaphor ("knot she hadn't known she'd been holding") is stock but brief and doesn't obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean and propulsive with strong images: "cold blue light," "stitches under his fingers," "terrible numbness." Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Deductions: paraphrase loop in paragraph 3 ("The procedure had been meant to give him a clean slate, but the slate kept showing through" followed immediately by "faint marks of the man who had done terrible things") re-states without added pressure (−0.2). Filter-verb reliance in several beats ("felt the phantom weight," "looked at the baseball") dulls immediacy (−0.3). One metaphor wobbles: "delicately robust in their survival" applies a character attribute to algae in a way that reads slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and opening/closing images anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in world-building passages (phoenix-ash soil, eclipse-saffron). However, template cadence appears in the transformation beat: "She had refused this bargain… had raged against it, had sought every alternative path" cycles synonyms without advancing pressure. The phrase "What fire separates, smoke reunites" is repeated verbatim twice, the second time tagged as "the universe's oldest promise," which reads as explanatory scaffolding. Figurative density is uneven: "stars burn cold from a distance but could consume worlds up close" is fresh, but "the membrane between worlds" and "the cosmos rarely offered" are stock abstractions. The final paragraph over-explains ("a second chance to hold what death had tried to steal") where the image of wings and laughter would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and image density is high ("jasmine and ozone and something older, something like grief preserved in amber"). However, the piece carries noticeable scaffold: paraphrase loops ("reached for the cards," "withdrew the cracked saucer," "placed the saucer"), metaphor stacking in descriptive passages, and template cadence ("There was... There was... There were") in the moment-recovery sequence. The cracked-porcelain/fault-line pairing is vivid but borders on over-figuration. Propulsion is solid through the ritual beats, yet the final paragraph's summary ("three years of love restored") tells rather than showing the recovery's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (most lines do multiple jobs). Minor loop detected: "made peace with endings" / "make peace with beginnings" is a purposeful chiastic return, but "the darkness" / "integrated shadows" / "shadow work" recurs frequently enough to approach synonym churn in the middle third. Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed vehicle ("cathedral of salvaged memories" / "bruise in space"—architectural vs. bodily). The final paragraph stacks declarative resolution slightly ("Her work was done. The shadows had been met, forgiven, and released. Now only light remained"), reducing propulsion at closure. No major opacity; clarity and concision are strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is controlled, though some phrases verge on overwrought ("the world split open like fruit," "mountains performing...slow dance"). A few scaffold moments appear: "She had intended...But a young woman had stopped her" reads as convenient summary rather than dramatized friction. The final paragraph's metaphoric density ("tides, like philanthropists, give everything away") risks forced symmetry. Information density is generally high, but the middle section loops slightly on the theme of release without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies well and information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or stakes. The opening and closing images bookend effectively. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "vigilance was not merely her duty—it was the rhythm of her heartbeat, the lens through which she saw the world" restates the same idea across two clauses; "intrigue could move freely, slipping through doors" also loops the concept. The metaphor density is high but controlled. Template cadence appears in the recruitment summary: "A cook who remembered... A stable hand whose... A scribe who..." which flattens momentum in a key explanatory beat. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase and template artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Ships no longer sailed—they slid endlessly..." anchors the friction loss and its consequence in one beat). Figurative language is controlled: "aurora rippled...like silk torn from dying stars" is vivid without muddle, and "eels glided...like thoughts through a dreaming mind" supports the mystical tone. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Grammar and tense are clean. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line ("somewhere in the depths, the eels began to dance") recharges the eel motif with purpose. Minor: "the universe would whisper its secrets" and "the aurora sang" lean slightly toward stock lyricism, though context supports them. No artifact penalties warranted.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well, and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without always adding clarity: "shadow alphabets," "electric wonder," "ghost accepting form," "storm-kissed wonder." Mixed metaphors in "furiously tranquil waves" (oxymoron acknowledged but still risks incoherence). Paraphrase loop near midpoint: "the way rage could settle… how her censored poems still burned" restates the same emotional state. Template cadence in exposition: "She had not spoken… not since the tribunal…" Apply −0.6 for density + coherence issues in peak beats, touching but not obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence rhythm and no major grammar errors. However, several lines loop conceptually: "waiting was never passive" is immediately demonstrated, and "elegant, violent disagreements" at the end paraphrases the prior sentence. The climax summary ("When it ended") is a major scaffold artifact that obscures the peak beat's causality. Figurative language ("velvet courtesy that concealed iron") occasionally stacks without adding information. Copy is consistent; no pronoun drift or typos noted.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is controlled and rhythmically varied with strong imagery ("stars poured through the gaps like witnesses"). However, scaffold and near-loops appear: "fractured light through broken glass" in one paragraph, "in fractures" and "broken ceilings and broken people" two paragraphs later; "all of them love Ezra. All of them remember the books" is a paraphrase loop. Template cadence in the final section: "In broken ceilings... in rusted metal... in the luminous space" stacks parallel constructions without added pressure. These artifacts are concentrated in the final third but do not obscure the closure image. Information density is high in the prison flashback but thins in the present-moment sorting beats.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high: "The broken anniversary clock beside her bench had stopped at 4:47, the exact moment her husband's airship had vanished into a storm three years ago" packs backstory, object, and motive into one economical line. Figurative language is purposeful ("dissolving into the mist," "horizon invited night") without overwriting. Propulsion is strong; every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Zero scaffolding or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied syntax and high information density. Figurative language ("doubt glowed within her like phosphorescence") is purposeful and grounded. Minor deductions: "empirically whimsical" recurs three times, bordering on motif overuse without full pattern payoff; "luminous doubt, that particular brightness" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward synonym churn. The phrase "gloriously uncertain, remembering everything in its own patient language" stacks modifiers without sharp propulsion. No major loops or scaffold, but these small artifacts prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("wet rocks," "cerulean light," "rhythmically placid whisper"). However, figurative density clusters in high-pressure beats: "drowning in everything unsaid," "tides of remembrance," "cerulean regret," "severed by the stroke" without clear pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loop: "The doctors called it aphasia. Mei called it drowning in everything unsaid" restates the same content without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "Mei knelt... spreading... pointed... moved..." runs a sequence of similar subject-verb structures. These artifacts dull momentum slightly but do not obscure causality.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with high information density: many sentences do double duty for scene, character, and theme. Figurative language (dust motes, sediment, “quiet flood of dementia”) is vivid yet controlled, and repetition of key terms like “dust,” “decay,” and “gradual change” reads as deliberate motif rather than looped scaffolding. There are no noticeable syntactic templates or clumsy metaphors, and line-level clarity remains strong through the ending. A few lines could be trimmed for maximum tautness, but there is no real artifact debt.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences generally carry multiple functions (scene, interiority, theme) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors around light, glass, frost, and code are coherent and motif-driven rather than randomly ornamental. There’s minor risk of over-richness in repeated pairings like “scorched testament” and “luminous,” but they stay legible and don’t blur meaning or momentum. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to maintain flow and clarity through a largely reflective piece.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level writing is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Metaphors (held-breath winter, silence living naturally, music in colors) are coherent and well controlled, with little redundancy or scaffolding. There is a mild tendency toward lushness and repetition around key nouns (“silence,” “frozen”), but it stops short of purple prose and remains clear. No major loops, clumsy constructions, or grammatical issues impede momentum or obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density—most sentences carry both image and emotional charge, as in “geometry bent like grief.” Figurative language is frequent but purposeful, largely avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. There are no evident loops, scaffolding, or syntactic tics that drag momentum. A few thematic lines come close to aphorism, but they’re supported by sufficient scene work to avoid feeling like cheap summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with images like “hunger shared created bonds that lectures could not” doing double thematic and atmospheric work. There’s minimal redundancy and no noticeable syntactic or figurative muddle; the rhythm reads smoothly aloud. A few phrases verge on familiar or expository (“product of a childhood spent learning that governments lied”), but they don’t significantly drag momentum. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready with room for slight sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally elegant and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty (setting plus theme, image plus emotion) and very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is rich but mostly coherent and purposeful, especially around inversion and fog; “watercolor ambiguity” and “foggy lucidity” are strong if borderline lush. Rhythm varies well, and key images at the end land clearly. At the most demanding level, a few phrasing choices lean toward purple or explanatory, which fractionally dulls the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm and often carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are mostly coherent and on-theme (fabric, weave, grain of time), and the prose sustains a high-density lyric mode with good clarity. There is a mild tendency toward lushness—occasional stacked modifiers and conceptual phrases—that risks purple if pushed further, but here it rarely obscures sense or momentum. No major loops, syntax glitches, or figurative muddles appear, especially around the closure beat, keeping the ending sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is clean, with good rhythm, clear syntax, and high information density—the story does not meander or repeat. Figurative language is generally apt and controlled, though a few constructions (“staggering grace she didn’t feel,” “religion” of seeds) are familiar enough to feel less sharp. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding remnants, or muddled metaphors, and the closing paragraph moves efficiently to its charged image. Overall, the prose is publishable-quality but lacks the unmistakable snap or compression that would push it into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept, with few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Imagery (“sonic fossils,” “frequency of absence,” “cathedral of moss and fractured glass”) is fresh and coherent, rarely tipping into purple for its own sake. Rhythm modulates well between long, lush descriptive lines and tighter emotional beats (the imprint and breakdown), maintaining momentum in a reflective piece. Minor density in figurative language doesn’t obscure clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: syntax is clear, there are no grammatical issues, and most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without padding. Recurrent motifs of light, emerald tile, and flowers are handled with control, though occasional phrases (“illuminated moments,” “luminous disbelief,” “destiny’s door”) verge on the generic or sentimental. The prose rarely loops or restates itself, maintaining good momentum for a largely descriptive piece. Some metaphors feel a bit safe rather than sharply original, but they do not obscure meaning or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures and strong, concrete verbs; most lines do double duty for mood and character. Figurative language centers on a coherent cold/thaw/warmth motif without becoming purple or tangled. There’s little scaffolding or repetition; exposition is efficient and tied to action (e.g., the manual and bookmark reveal world and grief simultaneously). A few thematic statements are a hair explicit, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is tight and purposeful, with strong verbs and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and most images cohere logically with the scene’s emotional and physical reality. Information density is high: backstory, motive, and present action are interlaced without obvious repetition or bloated exposition. There are a few slightly abstract formulations, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically controlled, and densely informative, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. Figurative language is generally precise and thematically coherent (tide, stone, light, silence), with minimal purple excess and no mixed-metaphor muddle that harms clarity. There are a few near-repetitions of concepts (silence, darkness, hush) but they function as intentional motif rather than scaffolding loops. The final lines land cleanly and musically without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, emotion, concept) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythmic variation suits the meditative mode. Imagery is often striking (“each flake another thought the robot janitor could not quite trace to its origin”), and the line-level clarity remains high. There are a few near-stock “poetic” moves (“geometries that should not have existed,” “transparent as memory”) and a mild density of abstractions near the end that risk feeling slightly over-explained rather than distilled. Trimming a couple of explanatory clauses would tighten momentum and sharpen the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and imagery that usually does more than one job at once. The prose leans lyrical but stops short of purple; metaphors (e.g., mistrust “calcified around him like ice”) are clear and thematically apt. There are a few slightly on-the-nose turns (“freed by honesty that needed no words”) and mild redundancy around the lens’s ambiguity, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or blur meaning. The closing image is clean and well-framed.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, often doing double duty for scene-setting and theme (“hands transform from smooth instruments of growth into gnarled roots themselves”). Figurative language is vivid but not piled-on, and there are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or cadence artifacts. The prose carries momentum even through reflective passages, and the final sentences land with a clear, charged image rather than abstraction. At a very demanding tier, one could ask for an occasional sharper, surprising turn of phrase, but nothing on the page dulls clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Metaphors like “legs of a sleeping spider,” “icy warmth,” and “sideways rivers” are controlled and thematically consistent rather than piled on indiscriminately. Expository content is efficiently woven into action and image, so the prose rarely stalls. There’s mild repetition of certain constructions and motifs, but it reads as intentional patterning rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely economical, with many sentences doing double-duty for atmosphere and character (“existing in the in between spaces where music was born but never seen”). Figurative language is mostly precise and thematically aligned (water as revealer, chords as silence/history), avoiding the muddle of mixed metaphors. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; line-level momentum carries the reader through exposition-heavy passages without drag. A small number of on-the-nose formulations and repeated constructions (“always, always”; a few summary statements) keep this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most images do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion or theme) without padding. Figurative language clusters around a coherent palette (weather, margins, weight), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess despite the density. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every sentence either advances the moral dilemma or deepens atmosphere. Minor risk of over-lyricism is kept in check by concrete anchors like instruments, tea, and the smudged illustration, so clarity and momentum hold through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, with most doing multiple jobs (advancing plot, conveying mood, and character simultaneously). Figurative language is generally apt and controlled, especially in the opening and around the tunnel/valve imagery. There are a few moments that edge toward purple or explanatory (“understanding settling into his bones with terrible weight,” “the truth he’d swallowed… was finally dissolving”), but they don’t obscure clarity or drag momentum. No noticeable scaffolding or repetition artifacts appear, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is polished: rich yet controlled metaphor, minimal redundancy, and high information density per sentence. Recurring images (silt, roots, crumbling shelves, water, folds) are patterned rather than repetitious, and the prose generally avoids mixed metaphors or clotted phrasing. A few lines border on over-articulation of ideas already implicit in the imagery, but not enough to meaningfully drag momentum. Overall, the piece reads as publication-ready at the sentence level for a lyric venue.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is fluent, rhythmically varied, and image-rich; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Motifs like roots, light/dark, and music are woven without obvious scaffolding, and transitions between description and action are smooth. At times the language leans toward sentimentality and repetition of key phrases (“ordinary magic,” “dreaming roots”), especially near the ending, which slightly blunts sharpness. Still, there are no serious loops or figurative muddles, and momentum holds across the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished, lean for its lyricism, and largely free of scaffolding or repetition; images like “the world exhaled its final imagining” and “bronze quiet” are strong and not overused. Sentences vary in length and structure, maintaining momentum despite the reflective mode. Figurative language is present but not piled to the point of purple; it generally clarifies rather than obscures. I see no major loops, mixed metaphors, or syntactic artifacts that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and efficient, with strong information density—sentences often do double duty as characterization and theme, and there’s very little scaffolding or slack. Rhythm varies well, from longer reflective sentences to shorter, pointed fortunes that punctuate the piece. Some phrases and concepts recur in near-identical form (“orchestrate meaning,” “open secrets,” “accidentally prophetic”), edging toward mild redundancy and didacticism. Overall, though, clarity and momentum are preserved, and the final lines land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, diction precise, and images like “ash gray, the hue of unraveled stillness” and “tears streaming… shadows dissolved like morning mist” are evocative without becoming opaque. Most lines do more than one job, advancing plot, mood, and theme together. There is some mild repetition and occasional purple tilt (“decorated the silence,” “cathedral of logic”), but it doesn’t seriously drag momentum or blur meaning. The final paragraph verges on over-explanation, yet the closing image of the humming anchor and breathing truth still lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, theme) without obvious padding, and the piece reads smoothly aloud. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful (e.g., dawn spilling “like honey,” the spire that “hummed with accumulated silence”), with few if any mixed metaphors. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum for this quiet mode is well maintained. A slight tendency toward lushness in clustered imagery keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and idea; there are few, if any, true scaffolding lines. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, and recurring paradoxes feel like deliberate motifs rather than muddled metaphors. A few phrases (“darkening brightness,” “periodically eternal”) walk the edge of abstraction, but they’re grounded by concrete images like rain, stone, and algae. Momentum holds well for a lyric piece; it doesn’t bog down in repetition or explanatory loops.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, with varied sentence structures and a good balance of image, action, and interiority. Figurative language is mostly apt and controlled—“the cavern exhaled its own kind of silence,” the needle retaining “memory” of songs—though a few phrases (“painful and glorious,” “like blood to numbed fingers”) are more familiar. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences do multiple jobs. The rhythm supports momentum through the ritual without bogging down in ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally elegant, with high information density and minimal redundancy; images like the message “curled tight as a sleeping moth” and storms “gathering quietly before they broke the silence open” are vivid and apt. Syntax and paragraphing create a smooth cadence that supports the contemplative tension without bogging down. There is a mild tendency toward thematic restatement (“She was dangerous not because…”) and abstraction in a few lines, but it doesn’t materially drag momentum or obscure clarity. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to feel purple, and the final sentences are clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density—most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character or theme. Imagery is consistently strong yet controlled; motifs like light, crystal, and extinction recur with clear purpose rather than ornamental repetition. There are no notable loops or scaffolding sentences, and syntax remains clear even when sentences lengthen. A few thematic statements verge on the abstract, but they don’t materially dull the closure image or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, with strong verbs, concrete images, and minimal scaffolding or redundancy; phrases like “rivers of abandonment” and “auroras with intention” feel precise rather than purple. Sentences do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, character—and the rhythm breathes well, especially around shifts between tactile detail and reflection. There are a couple of moments of near-restatement or mild abstraction, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure sense. Overall craft is comfortably at a publishable level for a serious venue.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, evocative, and information-dense, and imagery (smoke filling “hollows of abandoned ships,” bowl glowing “like an ember”) is precise without becoming purple. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles, and the rhythm breathes appropriately with the contemplative stakes. A few abstractions (“chronic hush,” “emptiness”) recur, but they’re anchored in concrete detail and pattern rather than redundant exposition. Overall, the prose would need only minimal editorial touch at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong images that usually do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character filter all at once). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent; “honey holds time” and “electrical sensitivity” mapping the grotto’s emotional residue are particularly effective. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and sentences tend to be information-dense without bogging momentum. A few phrases approach explicit abstraction (“professionally thorough,” “her professional distance hemorrhaging”) but they don’t materially cloud the closure or pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is clean, with varied sentence rhythms and generally efficient exposition; there are few, if any, genuine artifacts or loops. Some metaphors and abstractions (“cycles of compassion,” “inherited obligation,” “harbor symphony”) are repeated in slightly different phrasings, but they mostly feel intentional rather than redundant. The middle section compresses time via summary smoothly without bogging down momentum. Occasional sentimentality and thematic reiteration keep it from the highest band, but clarity and control remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is strong: images are mostly fresh, sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, character), and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. Phrases like “black as grief, bright as hope” and “figures of connection, of reaching, of almost-touching-finally-touching” are striking without sinking into incoherence. There is a consistent density of figurative language that flirts with purple but remains legible and purposeful, aided by good syntactic variety. A tighter rein on abstraction in the closing thematic statements would further sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense without real redundancy. Figurative language (e.g., canals like silver threads, time sculpted like clay, cage of crystallized sound) is vivid and coherent rather than overwrought. There are no evident scaffold lines, syntactic glitches, or mixed metaphors that blunt the climax or closure. The prose flirts with high-density lyricism but keeps clarity and momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, character, and theme; lines like “She traced them with her fingertips, reading damage like language” are dense without being opaque. Figurative language is frequent but mostly purposeful and coherent, and the story avoids obvious paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. A few abstractions (“Ambiguous loss carved stranger wounds than clean grief ever could”) edge toward thematic statement, but they are grounded enough not to stall momentum. Overall, the line-level craft supports clarity and emotional effect rather than calling attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is polished: images are vivid, sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, interiority, theme) without bloating, and there’s very little slack or repetition. Figurative language (shadows like spilled ink, the library breathing) is coherent and tonally unified, avoiding mixed metaphors. A few phrases edge toward the purple or redundant (“kindly and methodical” recurs; some abstractions in the final paragraph restate prior implications), but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur clarity. Overall rhythm and concision are strong enough for high-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and pull multiple duties (atmosphere, character, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Imagery is coherent and well-curated—moss, roots, veins, milkweed-silk hair—forming a tight metaphorical network. There is some repetition of abstract terms like “change,” “growth,” “transformation,” and explicit aphoristic lines that slightly flatten the otherwise vivid texture. Still, momentum and clarity remain intact through the ending, and no major artifacts blunt the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, and images like the causeway as “a spine emerging from grey flesh” are striking without becoming overwrought. Most figurative language is coherent and tied to the water/ruin palette; there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. A few abstracted phrases and near-repetitions around “threshing meaning” slightly dilute impact but don’t materially harm momentum or clarity. The final image is crisp and charged, with no figurative muddle at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is strong line by line: images are vivid, sentences varied, and most carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once). Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or real purple excess. There’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition, and transitions are smooth. A handful of lines edge toward abstraction (“powers older than her visions”) but not enough to drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and a high information density; most lines do at least two jobs (world-building, characterization, and theme). Metaphors and images (“patient as salt,” “accumulated absences”) are apt and coherent, with minimal redundancy or scaffolding. A few phrases border on conceptual repetition, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and minimal scaffolding or repetition; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). Figurative language is generally fresh (“fortress of unspoken truths,” “landscape of secrets”) and controlled, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. Rhythm varies effectively, and the opening and closing lines are particularly strong. A few abstractions in the final paragraph compress complex emotion into concept (“geography of a family broken by silence”) but do not significantly blunt clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length, carry multiple functions (image, emotion, world), and generally avoid redundancy. Figurative language around whale song, starlight, and threads of consciousness is cohesive rather than muddled, and there are no significant syntactic or grammatical slips. A few phrases verge on purple or explanatory (“courageously kind,” “architecture of shared thought”), and some emotional beats are told rather than fully embodied, slightly blunting momentum. Overall, though, the prose has good propulsion and clarity without obvious scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, economical for its lyric mode, and often carries multiple functions per sentence (world-building, mood, and character all at once). Figurative language is generally fresh and coherent (“dimensions folded like origami,” “hushed thunder”) without slipping into purple excess or mixed metaphors. There are a few abstract or slightly slogan-like lines that could be sharpened into more concrete image, but repetition and scaffolding are minimal and momentum is maintained through to closure. Rhythm varies well enough to pass the read-aloud test and frames both action and reflection cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, economical, and mostly free of scaffolding or loops; many sentences carry multiple jobs (character, theme, and setting at once). Images like “death dressed in chemical perfume” and the ink pot “weighted with all the years” are vivid without tipping into purple. There is some repetition of concepts (“mathematics,” “fair trade,” “liquefy rigid thinking”) that feels intentional but verges on over-explication rather than pure image. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to sustain momentum, with no significant line-level artifacts dulling the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, imagery is vivid yet generally precise (“air smelled of cedar and patience”; “tastes of ash and wedding cake”), and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined, serving character and theme instead of piling up into confusion. The prose moves with steady momentum for a contemplative piece, and the final sentences land cleanly without purple excess. Minor density in modifiers keeps it just shy of the very top range, but it’s comfortably publishable at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and generally efficient sentences that carry atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously (“bureaucratic acid” is a compact, effective example). Rhythm varies and paragraphs are well-shaped; there’s little in the way of scaffolding or paraphrase loops. A few phrases verge on purple or repeat conceptual ground (“evidence of an erased history that belonged to no one and everyone”), but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur sense. Figurative language is mostly coherent and consonant with the setting, allowing the closure image to land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, image-rich, and generally do double duty for mood and character, with very little scaffolding or redundancy. A few lines flirt with stacked abstraction (“the timeframe of revelation is strange—it exists inside the whisper of closing pages”) but remain legible and thematically relevant rather than purely ornamental. Momentum is maintained throughout; description rarely stalls the scene. Slight trimming of the densest metaphoric phrases and one or two near-redundant thematic reiterations could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, well-structured, and often do double duty with setting, emotion, and theme. There’s minimal redundancy, and most paragraphs earn their space, maintaining momentum despite some necessary exposition. A few lines lean toward generalized abstraction (“world that increasingly viewed communities like theirs as curiosities”) rather than fresh image, and the “they might lose everything” paragraph tells what the surrounding imagery already implies, creating minor scaffolding. Overall, though, rhythm, clarity, and density are above-average and do not impede closure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, precise, and usually do double duty for atmosphere and character, with only minimal redundancy (“the dawning hush” is perhaps one beat over-used). Figurative language (“crater lake…like a held breath,” “stars began their daily drowning”) is mostly fresh and sensibly grounded in the scene’s physics and mood. The prose maintains momentum despite reflective density, largely avoiding scaffolding, synonym churn, or mixed metaphors. A few near-platitudinous formulations are saved by their anchoring in concrete images, keeping the piece in the high band but short of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level writing is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and generally efficient, concrete detail. Figurative language (e.g., the mist as “breath from an ancient god”) tends toward the lush but stays coherent and legible. There is some redundancy around thematic phrases (“broken things,” “messages”) and a mild purple tint in places, but it doesn’t seriously stall momentum. Information density and clarity remain high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences are tight, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“Rivers don't begin where you want them to”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, with metaphors (scars, vocabulary of ice, languages as maps) chosen to reinforce theme and setting rather than decorate. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line advances either tone, character, or stakes. The only mild limitation is that the overall density borders on lush for a quiet scene, which might risk heaviness in a longer piece but works here.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with work (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once), and almost entirely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is controlled and coherent—“fall like a seed falls” is both clear and thematically precise—and avoids mixed metaphors. The prose maintains momentum despite a reflective, ritual-driven plot, in part by anchoring abstractions in concrete actions like walking, tuning, and folding buildings. I see no significant artifacts, loops, or clarity failures that would need line edits before publication.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong verbs, precise nouns, and metaphors that are both sensical and thematically aligned (e.g., particles as “frozen starlight,” time pooling around the vial). Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and paragraphs each add new pressure or texture rather than looping. Figurative density is high but not cluttered; images are carefully chosen and rarely redundant, and there are no mixed metaphors that muddle meaning. One could trim a phrase or two of abstraction without harm, but there are no significant artifacts or scaffolding that sap momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, description does multiple jobs (world-building, theme, mood), and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with few if any mixed metaphors or purple flourishes that impede clarity. Pacing remains taut; exposition is compressed efficiently, and the climax is rendered in-scene rather than summarized. A couple of near-platitudinous lines are the main minor drag on an otherwise high-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: imagery is rich yet mostly precise, with few redundancies and strong multi-function sentences that advance setting, emotion, and theme at once. The metaphoric palette (glass cathedral, quicksilver streams, veil, winter) remains coherent and controlled, avoiding significant mixed or clashing imagery. There is some density of figurative language, but it supports mood instead of suffocating action, and the prose maintains momentum into and through the climax. No notable loops or scaffolding impair the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and structure, carry multiple functions (world, mood, theme), and generally avoid scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (e.g., “orchid solace,” “their salt-crusted basins holding only dust and the memory of water”) is strong and mostly precise, without mixed metaphors. The density of imagery is high but controlled enough that momentum never stalls, and grammar and clarity are clean. A few abstractions (“monument to cruelty,” “reverence of a different kind”) slightly thin the texture compared to the best image-driven lines, keeping this just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is tight: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually do more than one job (advancing scene and theme simultaneously). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with no major paraphrase loops or purple excess; the orchard and sundial images are especially clean. Momentum is well maintained despite reflection, and syntax remains clear. A few thematic sentences could be trimmed or made more concrete to avoid slight explanatory redundancy near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is tight, rhythmically varied, and image-rich without tipping into purple; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, theme) efficiently. Metaphors are controlled and consistent with the piece’s concerns (velocity, bodies, veins, cathedrals of light). There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the copy is clean. A few abstractions near the end (“slow and deliberate magic of connection”) are slightly general, but they don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, imagistic, and information-dense, with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors (“syllables she collected like scattered pearls,” “leaves spiraled past…like copper coins thrown to fate”) are largely fresh and coherent with the story’s aesthetic. The lushness approaches the edge of over-decoration in places but does not obscure clarity or momentum, and the closing cadence is well-judged. Grammar and sequencing are clean, making the piece feel ready for publication with minimal copy-editing.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and musical: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most lines carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, and theme together). Figurative language (“voices threading through the twisted branches like silver through dark water,” “space where her apology hung unspoken”) is generally precise and coherent, rarely tipping into purple. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic templates that slow momentum. A very few metaphors (“unsent letters in your blood”) lean toward the ornamental but do not materially harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong, with vivid metaphors (“anesthetic spread…like warm honey,” “languages tanched together like fishing nets”) that feel fresh and apt. Sentences generally do double duty—advancing scene and deepening theme—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The prose leans lush, but figurative density rarely tips into purple or confusion, and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. The closing image with “lotus-hearted ache” is slightly ornate yet still coherent with the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory images (“pigments had faded to whispers,” “light flowed from her instrument like exposed film”) and generally high information density; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character). Rhythm varies well, and there are few if any true loops or scaffolding phrases. A slight tendency toward the poetic in every line skirts purple but doesn’t tip into muddle, and clarity remains intact throughout, including at the ending. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor tightening possible in a few abstract phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, concise, and often do double duty (worldbuilding plus theme, or action plus interiority). Figurative language (“garden bloomed in frequencies rather than petals”) is fresh and coherent, with no noticeable mixed metaphors or redundancy loops. Information density is high without feeling cramped. A couple of spots lean into mild repetition of idea (certainty vs curiosity) rather than new image, which trims the top end of the range.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with vivid yet controlled imagery (“mandibles clicking…like a chorus of tiny conspirators,” “patterns…like a virus of hope”). Sentences generally do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, tone, and character in one stroke—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. A few metaphors stack, but they stay coherent and don’t blur sense or momentum. Line-level craft comfortably meets elite-market expectations for clarity and density at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense with meaning yet generally clear, and most carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and patterned rather than haphazard; images like “photosynthesize that darkness” and “calcium prayers” feel both apt and memorable. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or mixed metaphors that blunt the closure, though the density occasionally risks ornamentation in calmer beats. Overall, the prose comfortably meets elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense with information and image, and most do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without feeling redundant. The metaphoric language is frequent but coherent and thematically keyed (crystal, opal, extinction, museums), avoiding major mixed-metaphor muddle. There’s minimal scaffold or paraphrase looping, and rhythm modulates well between sweeping description and more focused ritual action. A slight tendency toward lushness in nearly every line keeps it from feeling maximally sharp for a top-market piece.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and efficient, often doing multiple jobs (world, mood, and character). Metaphors like “cathedral of silence” and “symphony of truth” are coherent with the premise and not over-stacked. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the closing image of the empty ink well “full of possibility” is earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with images like “the building breathed” and “sleeping giants” doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. There’s minimal redundancy, no evident synonym loops, and figurative language is selective enough not to slide into purple. Technical details (surveying chain as cipher, adhesive analysis) are crisp and efficiently conveyed. A few abstract phrases (“dappled resolve,” “encrypted compassion”) flirt with over-neatness, but they’re grounded enough in concrete context to avoid feeling like scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, with high information density and minimal redundancy; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Metaphors (“dark as dried blood,” “withering…new growth emerged from the dead matter of secrecy”) are vivid and coherent, supporting the decay/renewal motif without sliding into mixed or overblown imagery. Rhythm and paragraphing are well-judged, allowing reflection without bogging momentum. A few sentences border on aphoristic, but they don’t significantly blunt the closure image or create notable scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, with high information density and purposeful imagery that rarely feels redundant or purple. Metaphors (“fractured hush,” “light lied constantly”) are distinctive but coherent, and they maintain a consistent conceptual field of reflection, perception, and misdirection. There’s minimal scaffold or paraphrase-loop; nearly every line carries character, setting, and/or theme simultaneously. A few moments edge close to abstraction or thematic telling, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is polished, with varied syntax, high information density, and metaphors that are mostly precise and consonant with the world. Phrases like “where the continental shelf dropped away like a sigh” and “breathing recycled air like a creature in hibernation” feel apt rather than overwrought. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or cadence artifacts, and the prose carries momentum despite its lyricism. A few abstractions near the end (“the rhythm of belonging,” “strange, quiet certainty”) are slightly less vivid than the earlier images but don’t significantly dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length, images are mostly clean, and there’s high information density with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language (“prismatic ghosts,” “cheerful gloom,” “carrying…like a lantern”) is vivid and largely unmuddled, though a few explanations of theme could be trimmed for even greater tautness. There are no obvious loops, template cadences, or grammatical slips undermining momentum or closure. The final paragraphs in particular balance image and abstraction effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and high information density—most sentences carry both image and idea without padding. Metaphors (chessboard stars, tides as rhythm) are apt and consistent rather than mixed, and there’s little to no scaffolding or repetition. A few lines flirt with lushness but stop short of purple, and momentum remains intact throughout. Line-level craft is fully professional and supports the story’s ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: rhythms vary, imagery is generally precise, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character). A few metaphors flirt with purple (“cosmic verses,” “captured cosmos”) but stay internally consistent and do not obscure meaning. There’s minor repetition in constructions like “She remembered…” and some stacked descriptors, yet momentum holds and crucial beats are dramatized, not summarized. Trimming one or two decorative adjectives and allowing a plainer line in the climactic inscription could increase punch.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with several striking images (“ribbons of color that painted the fog,” “noctilucent reckonings”) and generally high information density. At times, the language edges toward aphoristic (“A pebble became philosophy when observed with intention”) and repeats concepts already implied by imagery, softening momentum. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and controlled; it does not devolve into muddle. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the final sentences land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and efficient: images like “rivers of melted wax” and the “centuries-slow waltz” of the planets are vivid without clutter, and most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing motion, character, and theme). Line-level rhythm is varied, and there are few, if any, genuine scaffolding or paraphrase loops. A handful of abstract, aphoristic sentences (“That was the curse of survival,” “Pain wasn’t a language…”) momentarily thin the textural specificity but do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. Overall, density and clarity would be competitive in a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty in image and character. Metaphors (trial balloons, pages of light, limestone veins) are coherent and not over-stacked for this mode. There are a few slightly redundant or abstract lines and one or two platitude-adjacent formulations, but no significant loops or muddled figures that blunt the ending. Overall, line-level craft supports momentum and atmosphere without drawing attention to seams.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; many sentences do double duty for setting, character, and theme. Image systems (ivy, stone, echoes, filaments) are coherent and not overextended, and there’s little in the way of redundant scaffolding or obvious loops. The main weakness is occasional abstraction and repetition around “legacy,” “purpose,” and “consciousness” that slightly dulls the sharpness of otherwise concrete imagery. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive venues, though tightening that conceptual repetition would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied syntax, strong verb choices, and dense but generally purposeful imagery (“clouds the color of dusky harmony,” “fragments of possibility”). The prose occasionally skirts purple and risks repetition around mirrors, light, and possibility, but it mostly avoids true muddle or redundancy. Nearly every line does at least two jobs—worldbuilding plus theme, or atmosphere plus character. Rhythm supports the quiet, reverent tone without dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are generally clear, varied, and information-dense; many lines do double duty by advancing scene and theme simultaneously (“Wildflowers now grew between the bones”). Figurative language is controlled and coherent, with recurring images (clipboard, moons, valley) used purposefully rather than as ornament. There are a few abstract or near-platitudinous formulations that could be sharpened, but they don’t significantly stall momentum or blur sense. No evident loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony mar the closure beat, and grammar and mechanics are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory images and generally efficient sentences that each add atmosphere, character, or thematic weight. Metaphors are vivid and mostly controlled; while there’s a fair density of figurative language, it feels patterned and deliberate rather than purple for its own sake. Rhythm varies well between long, coiled sentences and sharper beats at key moments (“She placed the dodo egg beside the speaker…”). There’s little to no scaffolding or repetition that drags momentum, and the final lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally elegant and economical, with vivid images that often do double duty for mood and theme. There is some stacking of abstractions and metaphors (“impossible geometry,” “harvest of echoes,” “anthem of sovereign choice”) that risks slight purple prose, but clarity is preserved. Sentences vary nicely in length and structure, maintaining momentum despite reflective content. I see minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and precise, with high information density—most sentences do multiple jobs in character, atmosphere, and theme. Metaphors are apt and controlled, avoiding purple excess while still offering memorable images (“campfire story stick,” “like a fallen moon,” “meteor hush”). There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or muddled comparisons, and syntax varies enough to keep the ear engaged. A few thematic formulations edge toward essayistic, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are fresh (“truth wore strange clothes,” “living river of fire,” “transiently rooted”), and most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and emotion at once) without padding. The prose avoids major artifacts—no noticeable loops, clotted metaphors, or register slips—and momentum is preserved even in reflective passages. There is a high density of figurative language, but it remains coherent and pattern-consistent, supporting the atmosphere rather than obscuring it. A stricter, slightly more varied rhythm at the emotional peak could sharpen impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and highly controlled: imagery (“aurora rippled… like a memory refusing to settle,” “technically gentle art of remembrance”) is precise and rarely redundant. Sentences carry multiple functions—worldbuilding, emotion, and theme—without padding, and paragraphing supports momentum. Figurative density is high but coherent; metaphors stay within the established lexicon of ice, craft, and music. There are no notable loops, scaffolding, or clarity slips, though the richness of language occasionally approaches, but does not cross into, purple territory.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is polished and efficient: most sentences do two jobs at once—advancing worldbuilding and character or theme—with little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically aligned, so the lyricism feels purposeful rather than purple. Rhythm varies well, with longer syntactic curls for conceptual passages and tighter beats around key actions like breaking the seal and emerging from the bunker. A few abstractions (“weapons of causality,” “engineer fate itself”) skirt the edge of density but do not obscure sense or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“bridge built from numbers and devotion,” “dusky harmony of twilight”) is generally fresh and controlled, not stacked to the point of opacity. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to maintain momentum, and crucial beats—like the primes emerging, or the 17-year orbital horizon—are rendered with clarity. Any mild tendency toward abstraction in reflective passages doesn’t significantly blunt the closure image or causal reading.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, mostly lean, and often do double duty with image and concept. Metaphors are purposeful and coherent, not stacked to the point of muddling sense, and there are few if any obvious scaffold or synonym loops. Expository lines (“Cellular memory was her method…”) are efficient rather than flabby, though they slightly flatten momentum. Overall propulsion and clarity remain high, supporting the closure image cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm and length, and nearly every line carries both image and conceptual work. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with very few strained or mixed metaphors; “the breath of boundaries dissolving” and frost “almost resembling writing” are especially effective. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; exposition is folded smoothly into sensory description. The density of imagery flirts with overwriting in places but maintains clarity and forward motion, particularly through the build-up to her using the reconstructed sextant.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, imagery is vivid but not overwrought, and almost every line does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, theme). There is little to no paraphrase looping or scaffolding; exposition is efficient and embedded in present action. Figurative language is fresh (“leaves drifting down like green snow,” “journal bound in leather so soft it felt like skin”) and remains coherent. The prose supports momentum and emotional texture with minimal artifact, fully meeting elite-market expectations for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally tight, vivid, and purposeful; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without padding. Syntax varies, and figurative language (“a smile from someone who knew too much about your future,” “a shell waiting sixty years for the creature complex enough to call it home”) is mostly fresh and coherent. There is minor conceptual redundancy around bewilderment and explanation of the rules, and one or two sentences verge on abstraction, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur closure. Line-level control is strong, if not dazzlingly risky.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and vivid, with many lines doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“language that had died before it was ever spoken,” “smelling of ozone and regret”). Figurative language is frequent but usually apt and not so dense as to clog momentum. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffold; sentences progress the scene rather than circling it. A few metaphors (“unheard symphonies,” “impossible flowers”) recur at the edge of lushness but they remain coherent motifs rather than purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images are often striking (“eyes watching her with blissfully aberrant joy, as if decay had freed them from the burden of motion”), and most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuild + theme, or mood + character). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, with only occasional near-purple moments that don’t significantly cloud clarity. There are no major loops, scaffolding sentences, or mechanical artifacts, and the final images land cleanly. Slight pruning of abstract phrasing could sharpen the already-effective prose.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty for setting, character, and theme without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language (e.g., the rope as “frozen waterfall”) is apt and not overstacked, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or clunky transitions. A modest amount of abstract thematic stating in the latter half slightly blunts momentum and sharpness but does not obscure clarity or closure. Line-level craft is publication-ready with minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, concrete, and efficient, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and interiority. Figurative language (e.g., “pregnant with the absence of noise,” “hammered repose”) is vivid and generally coherent, with minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Momentum is well maintained despite the quiet, reflective mode; each paragraph adds new pressure or texture. Occasional phrases flirt with purple, but they don’t obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and economical: most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or image plus theme), and there is little redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is mostly fresh and sensorially coherent, with glass, light, and sound forming a tight motif. There are occasional high-register metaphors and personifications that flirt with purple but stay on the right side of clarity and momentum. No significant loops or structural artifacts drag the final third, so the closure image lands crisply.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and often striking—images like “fog…solidified into something resembling pale marble” and pages of birds’ feathers that “naturally record…sounds and emotions” are vivid and efficient. Figurative language is frequent but mostly clean and coherent, and sentences generally do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without obvious padding. There is some conceptual repetition around memory/identity and a few lines that tell theme overtly, but they do not significantly drag momentum or clarity. Rhythm and paragraphing support the contemplative pressure arc and land the closing image with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, sensory detail is dense but generally purposeful, and there’s good information compression (e.g., the knot’s history in a compact paragraph). Some metaphors lean lush (“dusk bled the sky into bruised purples”) but stay coherent and tonally appropriate, without stacking to the point of muddle. There’s little scaffolding or repetition; most lines do at least two jobs (atmosphere plus character or theme). A slightly high density of figurative language in the opening could be trimmed for maximum elite-market tautness, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically pleasing, with strong information density: most sentences carry character, setting, and theme simultaneously. Metaphors (tides, cicadas, textures of time) are consistent and largely unmuddled, and there is minimal scaffolding or repetition that feels like filler. At times, the language edges toward the ornate, with several abstract noun phrases in close proximity (“texture of it,” “spaces between things,” “tangential approach toward grace”), but it never drifts into true purple confusion. Overall, line-level craft would be competitive in many top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, mostly unburdened by scaffolding, and images (“gardens that grew sideways,” “shelters woven from solidified mist”) are striking without becoming incoherent. Information density is high for this length, with minimal redundancy or filler. A few moments verge on explanatory or repetitive in concept, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur the closure image. Overall, the prose shows strong control and readability suitable for a competitive venue.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most images carry multiple loads (world-building, emotion, and theme at once). Metaphors around light and sound (“dust made of light,” “carrying its new quiet like a gift”) are apt and not overstacked to the point of purple prose. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; exposition is condensed and purposeful. A few phrases recur (“fluidly logical”) but as deliberate motif rather than artifact, and they do not blunt the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most carry multiple functions (worldbuilding plus theme, or image plus plot progression). Figurative language is rich but not so dense as to become purple or confusing, and there are few to no paraphrase loops or filler sentences. Syntax remains clear, with actions presented in an intelligible order and almost no scaffolding phrases that could be cut without loss. A touch more restraint in consecutive metaphorical flourishes would sharpen impact further, but nothing meaningfully obscures sense or dulls closure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, concrete images (“charcoal dust,” “burns traced constellations”) carry multiple jobs, and there’s little to no padding or scaffolding. Figurative language is generally coherent and thematically aligned, with only mild repetition (“loaded emptiness,” bridges/thresholds) that doesn’t significantly dull impact. Momentum holds across the scene; exposition about shadow keeper arts and scars is concise and anchored in present action. It falls short of the very top band mainly because some closing thematic lines state what the imagery already implies.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, theme) with little redundancy, and metaphors like “a doorway made of probability” or “grief made gorgeous” feel both fresh and legible. Rhythm varies well, and there’s minimal scaffold or paraphrase looping; almost every line advances atmosphere or character. Occasionally the prose stacks abstractions (“concepts became physical”) without immediate sensory anchor, but these moments are brief and usually followed by concrete images.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures and a strong ear for rhythm; most lines are doing double duty in atmosphere and characterization. Figurative language (e.g., “amber light pooled like honey,” “truth accumulated like sediment”) is vivid and coherent with the story’s conceptual frame. While the style is lush, it largely avoids purple excess, repetition, or metaphorical muddle, and there is no noticeable scaffolding or synonym churn. A touch more restraint in a few descriptive clusters could sharpen momentum, but the line-level craft is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, interiority), and largely avoid redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is vivid yet mostly clear—“like a sleeper turning beneath heavy blankets” is concrete and apt—and there are few, if any, mixed metaphors. Some formulations (“factually mystical,” repeated “shivering bliss”) slightly strain tone or risk over-lushness, but they don’t obscure causality or the closure image. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready, if not yet at the rare, formally dazzling level.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, image-rich, and efficient; most sentences carry multiple weights (character, theme, and setting) without bloat. Metaphors like reading dust “like scripture” are vivid and coherent with no mixed imagery or purple excess. There is minimal redundancy and no visible scaffold or cadence artifact, and the final lines land with clear, unfussy impact.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and largely economical, with most sentences doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding and character, or theme and motion). There’s minimal redundancy or scaffold, and the rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. Some phrases lean on abstraction or familiar formulations (“tyranny of indifference,” “palatable fictions,” “the only fight worth fighting”), which slightly dulls the line-level freshness. The high-pressure beats are sometimes compressed into summary rather than sharpened through image, preventing the language from fully elevating the climactic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and generally purposeful figurative language; lines often do double duty for setting, emotion, and theme. Images like “moisture still clung to everything like whispered secrets” and “fragments of memory” are strong and coherent with the core metaphor set. There is some repetition in mist/light/prism imagery and occasional near-purple density, but it rarely stalls momentum or obscures sense. Tightening a few redundant modifiers and metaphors would elevate this into an even cleaner lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, with high information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, reinforcing motifs of constellations, mapping, and growth without devolving into mixed metaphors. Momentum is maintained despite a reflective mode, and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or filler scaffolds. Occasional slightly generic abstractions (“something vast and incomprehensible,” “transformed always”) keep it just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level writing is polished: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (“every clock she'd repaired had simply learned to lie more convincingly about certainty”). Figurative language is generally apt and not over-stacked, and there are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or muddled metaphors dulling the closure image; the final waterfall line lands cleanly. A few abstractions and explicit thematic statements slightly reduce the tautness of the prose in the last third, but they don’t significantly harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with meaning; most sentences carry multiple functions (scene, character, and theme) without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is generally clean and apt, with recurring motifs (gold seams, weight of names, rain) reinforcing the central idea. A few abstractions (“most profound transformations,” “balanced alchemy”) verge on essay-like explanation, but they do not seriously drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and efficient: sentences typically carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without feeling overstuffed, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Imagery like “notes bent reality itself” and laughter as “medicine that made grief survivable” is clear, apt, and not over-mixed. Line-level rhythm supports momentum from descent through revelation to ascent, with no obvious loops, filter-verb stacks, or purple-prose density that bogs the climax. Minor moments of thematic statement are the main softness, but they don’t obscure sense or cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally dense with information, doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion, and the imagery around light, numbers, and pain is coherent rather than mixed. There is some repetition of similar constructions and abstractions (“mathematical truth in her bones,” “seismograph of suffering”) that brushes against purple, but it rarely obscures sense or momentum. The piece avoids scaffold phrases and summary loops, and transitions between physical sensation and reflection are clean. With a slight tightening of a few near-redundant metaphors, this would be top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are vivid without becoming muddled, and there’s little to no scaffold or synonym-churn. Figurative language (worlds as translucent pages, light that remembers) is mostly fresh and purposeful, supporting theme and atmosphere. A few abstract phrases (“strange country of becoming”) push toward the lyrical, but they remain legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is clean and efficient, with good sentence variety and no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle. Many sentences do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and character (“The way particles settled told stories if you knew how to read them.”). The “weight/weightless burden” motif is repeated but feels intentional rather than redundant, culminating in the final paragraph. A bit more rhythmic daring or compression at peak emotional beats could further elevate the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character at once) without collapsing into purple or muddled metaphor. Cadence varies, key moments are cleanly rendered (“The library shuddered, then laughed”), and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundant phrasing. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern-consistent, and the closure image reads crisply. A touch more syntactic spareness around the climax could heighten impact, but line-level craft is already high.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is tight: most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotional shading, and forward motion), and the metaphors (“time flow…in ribbons of amber and violet,” “heart that spoke in verse”) are coherent and controlled. There’s little redundant scaffolding, and the prose sustains momentum despite its density. A few formulations (“peeled back reality’s skin,” “captured lightning”) are familiar, but they’re balanced by fresher images like architecture as temporal sails and storms “singing” against spires. Overall, line-level execution is polished enough for competitive literary SF, with only minor room to pare a cliché or two.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, free of loops or scaffolding, and do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) efficiently. Metaphoric language (“covenant of rust,” “reclaimed dawn”) is generally coherent and on-theme, without piling so densely as to blur sense. A few formulations flirt with sentimentality or abstraction but do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. Overall rhythm supports the ritual’s rising intensity and the quiet resolution at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn, and the rhythm fits the meditative descent. Figurative language (“cathedral columns,” “impossible lace,” “captured sky”) is frequent but controlled, with few if any mixed or confusing metaphors. There is minor risk of purple density, particularly around the lagoon description, yet it doesn’t obscure causality or dull the closure image. Overall momentum holds well for a contemplative piece, though a touch more syntactic sparseness near the climax might heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and good information density; most sentences are doing multiple jobs (setting, character, theme) without obvious scaffolding. Metaphors are mostly coherent and apt, and the rhythm supports the accumulating, reverie-like structure. There are a few moments of abstraction and near-repetition (“to scaffold complexity with simplicity” rephrased, thematic triads at the end) that read a touch like crafted slogans rather than lived thought, slightly dulling peak impact. Overall, though, line-level craft is clearly above average and rarely obscures sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is highly polished: sentences carry multiple functions (image, interiority, theme) with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, lush lines and shorter, declarative ones, and figurative language is generally precise and non-muddled. There is some density of metaphor, but it feels controlled and patterned rather than purple or confusing. I see no significant loops or artifacts that sap momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight and evocative, with strong image selection and minimal redundancy; many sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Figurative language is rich but mostly disciplined, and there are few if any mixed metaphors or padded loops. Rhythm varies well across exposition, vision, and present action, keeping momentum despite summary sections. A slight tendency toward high-density lyricism in explanatory passages keeps this just below the very top band but never muddies clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences are clear, rhythmic, and generally efficient; most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or theme plus character). Imagery is coherent and mostly well-judged, with the lantern motif especially effective and the final paragraph landing cleanly. There are a few familiar turns of phrase and near-platitudes that slightly dull the sharpness (“hollow promises,” “convenient crutch of magic,” explicit thematic inversions). Still, there’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and momentum never noticeably sags.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong image-making (“sky the color of bruised plums,” “velvet disquiet”) and generally high information density—most sentences are doing double duty for world, mood, and character. Line-level rhythm is varied, and there are few if any outright redundancies or syntactic artifacts; the text reads smoothly aloud. At times the imagery edges toward lushness, and the density of figurative phrases risks becoming uniform, but it doesn’t seriously obscure sense or clog momentum in this contemplative mode. A bit more strategic contrast—plain, cutting lines at key realizations—would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, key images do double duty for atmosphere and theme, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors (constellations of breath, cathedral of ice) are coherent and thematically pointed rather than mixed. Information density is high without sacrificing clarity, and syntax generally propels rather than stalls. It leans lush, but not to the point of obscuring cause/effect or dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, dense, and purposeful, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and character (“where storms came to die, anchored to nothing but faith and the weight of accumulated silence”). Figuration is mostly clean, with recurring images (silence, rope, equilibrium) rather than scattershot metaphors, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. The overall register hovers near the high-lyric edge, which may feel a touch uniform in calmness across beats, but it doesn’t impede clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm and paragraphing are strong, with clear, uncluttered syntax and few redundancies; most lines pull double duty for mood and character. Some figurative phrasing edges toward purple or repetitive (e.g., multiple assertions about smallness, stillness, and meaning) but does not obscure sense or closure. The final image of the yellow glass as “a small captured sun” is vivid and well-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character/world-building. Imagery is rich (“cracked earth bleeding heat into the copper sky”) yet generally controlled; metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned with bees, glass, heat, and silence rather than scattered for effect. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and the final paragraph lands cleanly with a strong visual cadence. The only limitation is a consistent lushness that slightly flattens dynamic contrast, but it does not impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density; most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and emotional shading. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and coherent, and there are no major loops or explanatory scaffolds that stall momentum. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to sustain a smooth reading rhythm, and the final paragraph lands cleanly. The piece edges toward lushness in places but stays on the right side of clarity, with no figurative muddle touching the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory specificity (“cobalt lagoon,” “burnished hush,” “ink bleeding slightly”) and minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Sentences often do double duty, advancing both mood and character, and the rhythm supports the quiet, accumulative design. There are a few potentially purple phrases (“by harmonizing discord,” “warmly attentive to its imperfections”) that feel a touch ornamental, but they don’t obscure meaning or momentum. Line-level craft is strong, if slightly mannered at times, and easily at or above many publishable pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: syntax is clean, there are few if any redundancies, and many sentences do double duty advancing both worldbuilding and theme. Figurative language (“heartbeats,” “conversation,” “threads of connection”) is coherent and patterned rather than piled on. A couple of generalized statements about “humans, in their desperate rush toward death” and “interspecies respect” lean toward abstraction but don’t significantly stall momentum. The final paragraph lands with a clear, charged image and no muddling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, with images (rainwashed tower, bronze quiet, amber of time) doing thematic and atmospheric work. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and transitions between present action and reflection are smooth. Figurative language is generally well-chosen and not overstacked; the few conceptual phrases (“molecular bond that held consciousness together across the void”) stay legible and on-theme. The prose could push risk slightly further in rhythm or compression, but it is already comfortably at publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, well-paced, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Figurative language (e.g., “sound like stones grinding underwater,” “narrow vastness”) is precise and restrained enough not to drift into purple. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and rhythm on a read-aloud level feels varied and intentional. I see no significant artifacts or muddled metaphors that would impede clarity or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, with most doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and key images (the waxed leaf, rust bleeding into clay) are sharp and coherent. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and action sequencing (e.g., the run to the pit and digging) remains clear. A few phrases verge on familiar (“breath caught,” “last of her courage”), slightly softening the otherwise distinctive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with generally strong sentence economy and purposeful imagery; lines often do double duty for mood and worldbuilding. A few metaphors and abstractions (“temporally stretched like taffy,” “true north of her own strange and blessed existence”) approach purple or restate what’s already clear, but they don’t significantly impede momentum or clarity. There is minimal scaffolding or synonym looping, and action ordering is easy to follow. The final paragraphs land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is controlled and clear, with strong opening and closing images and mostly efficient sentences that carry multiple functions (world, mood, character) at once. Figurative language (“sky the color of bruised plums,” “doors dissolved like morning frost”) is vivid but not overstacked, and there is little paraphrase looping. A few lines drift toward explicit abstraction and thematic telling, particularly near the end, which slightly dulls the climax’s subtlety. Overall, though, rhythm and syntax support momentum and emotional charge without visible artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (character, theme, and image) with little redundancy, and rhythm varies well. Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined and consistent, and the prose remains clear despite its lyric density. Minor moments verge on telling or thematic declaration, yet there are no real loops, clunky metaphors, or syntactic artifacts that blunt the closure image. The final paragraphs in particular are tight and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is tight, image-rich, and does multiple jobs per sentence—worldbuilding, emotion, and theme are often carried together. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent; metaphors (mercury mind, language as terrain) feel integrated rather than ornamental. There is little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic monotony, and reading rhythm holds up across the piece. Line-level craft clearly supports the closure image without blurring sense.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lean but lyrical, with high information density: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Rhythm varies well, and images are generally clean and unmuddled; metaphors (labyrinth, threads, thunder) are coherent and recurring rather than piled indiscriminately. Redundancies are minimal, and action order is always clear. The main limiter is a faint tendency toward explicit thematic phrasing at the climax, not genuine line-level clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world, theme, emotion) with little padding, and metaphors are controlled and on-theme. There’s some repetition of key phrases (“price of forgiveness,” “flattening of a soul”) but it reads more like deliberate motif than scaffolding, and does not stall momentum. The prose nearly reaches a top-tier polish; a touch more variation in figurative texture and an occasional cut of overtly explanatory lines would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: vivid metaphors, varied syntax, and generally high information density with little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent with the story’s motif system (acid, dissolution, gold, quilting, kintsugi). A few phrases flirt with overtness or abstraction (“conjuring meaning from the edge of oblivion,” some thesis-like sentences near the end), but they do not obscure causality or dull the climactic image. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum from opening hiss to final drift.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple layers of work (setting, mood, and character) without padding, and the prose reads clean and deliberate. Figurative language is generally apt and not over-stacked; phrases like “cathedral built by water and time” and “living punctuation” are fresh and controlled. There are a few moments of slight redundancy or thematic restatement (e.g., explaining the quay’s meaning right after we’ve already inferred it) that could be tightened for even greater density. Overall momentum is smooth, with no obvious scaffolding or mechanical loops.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and metaphors that are generally coherent and purposeful. Images like “paint the exact color of exhaustion” and “fingers like dried flowers” do double duty for atmosphere and character. There is a slight tendency to stack figurative language in some paragraphs, which risks purple if pushed any further, but it doesn’t yet bog momentum or clarity. I see no meaningful scaffolding or synonym loops, and the final sentence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“mechanical joints groaning like something wounded,” “starlight fracturing into a thousand directed beams”) and high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Rhythm varies well between exposition, reflection, and action beats, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to become purple, and it largely maintains internal coherence. Minor abstraction spikes in the thematic sentences are the only noticeable drag on line-level sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied in structure, and carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without bloat. Figurative language (“steel lines that sang in the wind like broken instruments”) is vivid but not overstacked, and metaphors stay coherent. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each paragraph advances situation or tension. A few abstract nouns (e.g., “grace,” “psychological safety”) appear, but they’re grounded enough in concrete context not to feel like prose drift.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is polished: images are precise (“bruised light of nautical twilight,” “pages filled with handwriting that was not his own yet felt achingly familiar”) and usually carry multiple functions (mood, character, theme). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and controlled, staying within a nautical/liminal register. There are no noticeable loops, filler, or syntactic artifacts, and momentum holds despite the reflective mode. The only minor drawback is a slight risk of lushness in places, though it never muddies clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences are generally clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there’s little in the way of scaffolding or synonym loops; the piece moves with good momentum from beat to beat. A handful of images or formulations feel somewhat conventional for literary fantasy (“glimmer like captured starlight,” “the cavern bloomed”), which slightly lowers distinctiveness but not clarity. Grammar, sequencing, and pronoun references are solid, and the final paragraphs land with a crisp, legible image.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are concrete, and most metaphors are internally consistent and purposeful. Prose density is high but generally does double duty, advancing both atmosphere and character interiority without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Phrases like “duties festered like untended wounds” risk slight cliché but are offset by more original constructions such as “earthbound stars defying their nature.” The language remains clear at the climax, with the memory-return beat and closing triptych of dawn/noon/evening landing cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, often doing double duty for image and emotion, and the metaphors (pocket-sun, frozen time shell, magma chorus) largely cohere. Figurative density is high but controlled; it rarely muddies sense or stalls momentum. There are minimal scaffolding phrases or paraphrase loops, and key beats (the flare of the pocket-sun, the taking and giving of the shell) are shown concretely rather than summarized. The main limiter is occasional near-ornate phrasing that edges toward purple, though it doesn’t seriously harm clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, with images doing multiple jobs (e.g., “catch water in a net” encapsulates her doomed methodology). Figurative language is mostly sharp and coherent, with few if any mixed metaphors or redundancies. Momentum holds despite a reflective mode because each paragraph advances either her emotional state or the temporal premise. There is minimal scaffold or repetition, though a couple of abstractions could be trimmed or grounded more directly in image.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong sentence-level rhythm and multi-function lines that often carry setting, character, and theme at once. Images like “the fog…like the city’s slow tears” and “generational misunderstandings fossilized in corrosion” are striking without becoming incoherent. Occasional phrases drift toward the poetic-generic or expository (e.g., “ordinary miracles,” “the real healing had never been in the oils but in the witnessing”), slightly softening impact. Overall, momentum and clarity are excellent with minimal redundancy or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and densely meaningful, with few if any redundant scaffolds or paraphrase loops. Metaphors (robes as spilled ink, frost like startled birds) are apt and not over-stacked in ways that blur sense. Pacing is well handled for a lyric piece; description advances emotional and narrative stakes rather than pausing them. The only small limitation is that the consistently elevated figurative texture slightly flattens modulation in a couple of beats where a sharper, plainer line might have heightened contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“her voice like wind through hollow reeds”; sheet music fluttering under the currents). Information is well-weighted; there’s little scaffolding or explanatory redundancy, and action remains clear. A few stock or slightly purple turns (“world held its breath,” “doomed orchard”) and repeated explicit thematic phrases introduce a mild sense of overstatement. Line-level craft is strong and publishable but not quite at the razor-honed, surprise-every-line level of top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, with metaphors that are generally coherent and apt. A few images verge on purple or feel like variations on the same register (“amber light that had no source,” “pause between universal breaths”), but they don’t materially obscure sense or momentum. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; most sentences earn their place by advancing image, concept, or both. Rhythm supports the meditative tone, though a sharper shift in cadence around the climax could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, polished, and atmospheric, with strong images like “the fjord lay still as black glass” and the clocks’ “quiet song of drips and gurgles.” Sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without redundant scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there are no significant clarity lapses. The rhythm of shorter declaratives during the countdown effectively quickens the pace without feeling gimmicky.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, and most metaphors (“quiet wildfire of luminescence,” “mushrooms moved through their substrate—slowly, then all at once”) are vivid and coherent. There is some repetition of imagery and phrasing (e.g., “quiet wildfire” recurs; permeability is explained multiple times), and a couple of lines slide toward thematic exposition rather than image. These are minor enough not to damage the closure but do slightly dull the edge for a top-tier literary market. Tightening those redundancies would lift the piece further.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level writing is strong: images like the “submarine” light and clover-scented air are precise and pull multiple duties (atmosphere, emotion, theme). Sentences are mostly lean, with good information density and minimal redundancy; reflection compresses efficiently rather than looping. There is some abstract phrasing and a touch of purple in the thematic summations, but not enough to obscure clarity or burden momentum. The opening and closing images are well-crafted and echo each other without mechanical repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythm, high information density, and images that generally do at least two jobs (atmosphere plus theme, or setting plus character). There is some mild repetition of thematic phrasing (“teach endings how to begin,” “transform repetition into renewal”) that reads more like emphasis than looped scaffolding. Figurative language is consistent and mostly apt (grief as circular, the city’s “electrical pulse”), without mixed metaphors or purple excess. Prose flows smoothly and supports momentum despite being reflective.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied syntax, clean mechanics, and a good balance of scene and compressed summary. Metaphors are mostly coherent and thematically aligned (ink, pages, steeping, blooming), with only minor flirtation with the familiar or ornate. Information density is high—nearly every line advances character, world, or motif—without significant redundancy. The prose is polished enough for a competitive venue, though a ruthless trim of a few abstract statements could further sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level writing is polished, with varied syntax, clean mechanics, and high information density—few sentences feel like scaffolding. Images are fresh yet controlled ("living shrouds," "desperately jocular," "as though the old station remembered what it was for") without slipping into purple prose. Momentum is maintained even through explanatory passages because they’re compressed and voice-colored. I see no significant repetition loops or metaphor muddle, and the final paragraph lands with clarity and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense but largely efficient: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and action) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is mostly apt and thematically unified around sound, mapping, and emotional topography, with little clutter. Rhythm is varied enough to sustain momentum, and the final images tie back to earlier motifs. A few lines verge on explanatory or summative rather than image-driven, slightly dulling the edge of the otherwise strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally tight, varied in rhythm, and information-dense: most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and character. Figurative language is selective and mostly fresh, and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts that drag momentum. Occasional repeated phrasing (“strange comfort,” “thresh meaning”) reads as motif rather than churn, though some thematic sentences could be sharpened or compressed. Line-level craft is solidly publishable, if not yet dazzling at every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, clean, and purposeful, with several striking images (“morning fog—present everywhere, touching everything, yet somehow intangible”) that do multiple jobs. Exposition is compact, and there’s little in the way of loops or scaffolding; nearly every sentence carries either emotional, thematic, or atmospheric weight. Some abstractions (“joyful sorrow of possibility bloomed,” “vocabulary of absence”) edge toward familiar lyrical shorthand but don’t derail clarity or momentum. Overall, the prose reads ready for publication with only light tightening possible around a few generalized emotional phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax and strong information density; nearly every sentence advances character, world, or theme. Metaphors and images are mostly apt and coherent, and repetition (fires, volcanic imagery, being “rescued”) feels patterned rather than accidental. There are occasional near-purple lines (“grief so tender it could have melted stone”) and slightly ornate formulations that could be pared back for maximum impact. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained throughout, and there are no obvious scaffolds or loops dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, purposeful, and often do double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion), with relatively little redundancy. Figurative language is mostly apt and not overstacked, and paragraphing gives the piece a breathable, accumulative rhythm matching its contemplative drive. A few phrases (“auroral sorrow,” “grief made luminous”) sit close to the edge of purple but are thematically on point and don’t blur sense. Tightening a handful of abstract formulations or near-repetitions would sharpen momentum even more.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is tight: sentences are clear, well-paced, and usually doing multiple jobs (world-building, character, and tone) without bloat. Images like “whispers traveled farther than shouts in the container maze” are precise and thematically charged without sliding into purple prose. There are no noticeable loops, mixed metaphors, or cluttered constructions, and rhythm modulates effectively between description and movement. The prose is strong and polished, if more quietly excellent than formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density—most lines do multiple jobs in tone, character, and world. Imagery is generally precise and apt, and repetition (rain, water, light) feels patterned rather than accidental. There are a few moments of near-overtness or slightly purple phrasing, but they do not materially obscure sense or dull the ending. Momentum holds throughout; there is little scaffolding or looped paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with vivid metaphors that mostly land cleanly and no significant scaffold or synonym loops. Sentences tend to carry multiple jobs—setting, mood, and character interiority—without padding. Figurative density is high but not so stacked as to blur sense, and key images (mist, magnets, queens) are clear at closure. Line-level craft easily meets elite-market standards, even if it doesn’t quite reach the rarefied, riskier extremes of 9+ work.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, imagery is precise (“twilight zone where sunlight still reached the sandy bottom”), and most lines do double duty for mood and information. Figurative language is used judiciously and coherently; it rarely tips into purple or mixed metaphors. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and transitions between exposition and present action are smooth. The final sentences efficiently crystallize theme and image without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are generally clean and concrete, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without padding. Metaphors like “shadows sweeping…like the hands of a broken clock” and “curls of wood falling like the tears she couldn't shed” are apt and not over-stacked. There are a few slightly on-the-nose or abstract lines (“anchors to darkness,” “the quiet persistence of continuing”) that skim close to essayistic, but they don’t obscure meaning or undercut the closing image. No major loops, scaffolds, or technical slips drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are musical without losing clarity, and many images do double duty for atmosphere and theme (“a sound like thought itself, like the moment before understanding arrives”). Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled; metaphors (cloud-shadow, lantern-moth hush, ice as memory) are consistent rather than mixed. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and paragraphing supports a smooth, accumulating momentum. It is lush enough that a stricter venue might ask for a few trims, but it never seriously obscures sense or dulls the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense; most lines accomplish multiple tasks (world, mood, character) without padding. Figurative language is vivid but not overstuffed, and there are no detectable paraphrase loops or template cadences dulling momentum. The final paragraphs risk a hint of sentimentality but avoid purple-prose excess or metaphor muddle. Line-level craft is strong enough for a top-tier market with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, and most do multiple jobs (advancing image, theme, and character simultaneously). Figurative language is generally precise and grounded (“the bell's voice shattered into prismatic harmonics”) rather than purple or muddled. A few abstractions and near-platitudinous formulations around connection slightly blunt the density and freshness of the prose, but they don’t obscure meaning or momentum. There’s little to no obvious scaffolding or repetition; the piece reads cleanly and fluently.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with high information density: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously (“as if a machine had learned to grieve and then to hope” is a strong example). Figurative language is generally clean and purposeful, and there is little in the way of scaffolding, loops, or clotted modifiers. A few phrases and motifs (“withering becoming bloom,” “curtains of intention”) recur near the edge of redundancy and occasionally read more like conceptual labels than lived perceptions. Still, clarity and momentum are well maintained, and the final paragraphs land with a controlled, resonant cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory images (“black as wet stone,” “cards whispering like secrets”) and efficient sentences that typically do more than one job. Rhythm varies well and there are few, if any, scaffolding or paraphrase loops; line-level control feels deliberate. A touch of conceptual repetition around her “project” and its aims keeps this from being absolutely razor-edged, but it never seriously drags momentum or muddies the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, and there’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic templating. A few phrases verge on purple (“colors that no longer existed in the modern world,” “like a lover’s confession”), which slightly risks over-saturation but doesn’t impede clarity or closure. Overall line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor tightening possible for taste.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density; most lines do double duty in worldbuilding and emotional shading. Images are generally precise and coherent (“shadows…curling around the hope-lattices like hungry vines,” “bloomed above the clouds like a garden of glass and light”). While the language is lush, it rarely tips into muddle or redundancy, and momentum is maintained despite a reflective mode. A few abstractions (“luminous regret”) and explicit summative lines slightly dilute the otherwise excellent line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with images doing multiple jobs (tail as biology, memory, and thesis). Figurative language is controlled and coherent; the mist and starlight motifs are repeated with purpose rather than drift into purple. There is some conceptual redundancy around the lesson of compassion and deception, but not enough to seriously drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in structure and length, with few if any redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Figurative language (e.g., “dawn bled,” “meteor-strike silence”) largely enriches rather than obscures, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism. Information density is high—objects, backstory, and theme are often handled in single, efficient images. There are no noticeable syntax errors, clunky repetitions, or clarity-breaking metaphors to drag momentum or muddle the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, character, theme) without fat. Metaphors are frequent but controlled and largely coherent, and there’s no obvious synonym-churn or structural scaffolding. Rhythm and sentence length vary in a way that supports the quiet, accumulative pressure. A few lines verge on lushness, but they do not obscure clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and efficient: most sentences do double duty in building atmosphere and advancing idea or action. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; the recurring stardust imagery and “unspoken words” motif are consistent and legible, and there are few if any true mixed metaphors. A couple of lines flirt with purple (“wrapped in the shadowed rapture of the aurora’s embrace”), but they don’t stall momentum or blur sense, and there is little in the way of scaffolding or redundant paraphrase. Line-level craft is clearly professional, though a touch of tightening could sharpen a few high-ornament beats.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a high density of lines doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language—“fractured lullaby,” “sky that remembered stars,” “occasionally everywhere”—is coherent and thematically aligned rather than decorative. Exposition is compact and mostly well-placed, and grammar and sequencing are clean. A few abstract noun clusters (“vast network of probability-paths,” “quantum containers”) slightly thin immediacy, but they don’t materially drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with rich but controlled imagery (“clockwork jaguar prowled on velvet pistons”) and good sentence-level variety. Most lines do double duty—worldbuilding and characterization or theme and atmosphere—without padding or synonym loops. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to become purple or confusing, and grammar and sequencing are clean. Minor repetitions of idea (“wild frontier of her mind,” “probable miracles”) feel intentional rather than scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and minimal redundancy; most sentences do double work in building world and emotion. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and thematically aligned with water, shore, light, and twilight, avoiding mixed or confusing metaphors. Momentum holds well for a reflective piece, with paragraphing and cadence supporting the gradual revelation and final turn at the shore of light. There are a few near-platitudinous statements, but they don’t materially dull the closing image or obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: metaphors like the fortress “drinking in the endless white like a bruise” and frost as “veins of silver” are vivid yet coherent, and most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, mood, character). The rhythm varies well across description and interior thought, keeping momentum through a mostly static physical scene. There are a few borderline-purple moments and repeated abstract formulations around “cost” and “hope,” but they do not materially blur clarity or dull the close. Overall density and propulsion are high, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, metaphor is generally apt, and information density is high without scaffolding or obvious loops. The prose sustains a lyrical register with good control—images like the rune sinking “through the parchment, through the shelf, through the stone floor itself” are both clear and evocative. A few stacked metaphors (“mourning veil,” “breath between one celestial arrangement and the next”) flirt with lushness, but they don’t obscure sense or momentum. Overall the writing is clean, musical, and efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and images that generally do multiple jobs at once (emotional, thematic, and worldbuilding). Metaphors are controlled and coherent, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; sentences flow with good rhythmic variation. A few phrases flirt with overt lyricism but remain tethered to character and scene, so momentum is never meaningfully compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, well-paced, and often do double-duty in imagery and emotional shading. Figurative language is mostly controlled and coherent, with recurring motifs (hum, mess, breath, stars) reinforcing one another rather than cluttering. There is mild repetition of certain abstractions (“mess,” “meaning,” “rebellion”) and a few phrases that feel like thesis statements, but they don’t significantly bog momentum. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready with only minor tightening needed to pare back explicit statements.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clear, economical, and often graceful, with several strong images (“steam…carried whispers,” “ferns…told her stories of heat and patience”) and minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, maintaining momentum without purple excess, and information density is high: backstory carries emotional and worldbuilding weight. There are no major artifacts, mixed metaphors, or syntactic confusions, and the final paragraph delivers a clean, charged cadence. The language could afford one or two sharper, surprising turns of phrase in the climax to rise to elite-literary distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is excellent: sentences carry multiple jobs (character, mood, theme) with minimal redundancy, and the imagery (“categories of before and after,” “small vote for the future”) is fresh and coherent. Rhythm modulates well between long, reflective lines and tighter, bodily detail during the panic beat. There’s little to no scaffold or synonym churn, and figurative language is sparing enough not to cloy. A couple of abstractions (“what purpose meant when the world kept turning regardless of human presence”) lean slightly essayistic, which keeps this just under top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is generally high, with vivid metaphors, strong verbs, and efficient paragraphs that maintain momentum despite the reflective mode. Most sentences do double duty—advancing both atmosphere and character—e.g., the tarot box “glow from within its own memory of fire” and the red thread as “a nervous system.” There is some flirtation with purple prose and conceptual repetition in the middle (“fragmentation,” “multiplicity,” “reality” statements), but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or dull the ending. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and the final image closes on a clean, charged cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, with strong verbs and concrete images—ink as “tendrils…like frozen lightning,” time as “honey-thick seconds.” Sentences vary in length and rhythm, maintaining momentum while supporting a contemplative tone. While figurative language is fairly frequent, it mostly clarifies rather than clutters; there are no major metaphor tangles or repetitive scaffolds. Minor density in the explanatory paragraph about the ink’s properties could be pared, but it doesn’t significantly drag the line-level energy.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences are clear, varied, and purposeful, with strong information density and minimal scaffolding; the piece reads smoothly and carries momentum. Image systems—cold, silence, humming machinery—are coherent and not overextended, with only a few familiar turns of phrase (“burned in her mind,” “world worth remembering”). There are no significant loops or purple-prose tangles, but the diction sometimes drifts into the generic when a more original line could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences mostly carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding, and imagery (“tranquil blaze,” “weight could be released”) is strong and coherent. There is some tendency toward reiterated structures and explicit explication in the later paragraphs, which slightly blunts momentum and mystery. Figurative language remains controlled—no mixed metaphors or density spikes that cloud sense. Overall, the prose is publication-ready with only minor tightening advisable.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with metaphors that are original yet legible (“feral beauty of a lullaby sung through clenched teeth” exemplifies the line-level ambition). Sentences generally do more than one job—moving action, illuminating character, and building atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to become purple or muddled, and I see no paraphrase loops or scaffolding. A few high-flown phrases flirt with over-embellishment but do not obscure sense or dull the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences are clean, well-paced, and largely free of scaffolding or paraphrase loops; each line either advances action, character, or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful, with the orbit/guilt and ink/correction imagery carrying thematic weight without overgrowth. Rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and there are no clarity-harming artifacts or syntax errors. A few formulations push toward the ornate, but they stay controlled and don’t blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and metaphors that mostly pull double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Phrases like “a place where time curled back upon itself like smoke remembering flame” are striking yet clear, and the prose rarely lingers on redundant scaffolding. There is some tendency toward conceptual stacking (“dissonance…like corrupted code in ancient machinery,” “haunted firmware”) that risks feeling slightly over-designed, but it remains legible and largely in service of the story’s logic. The ending could be marginally tighter by trimming one or two abstract generalizations without losing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images are often striking (“colors that no longer existed in the world above”), and most lines do multiple jobs at once. The mandala and tile motifs are threaded without redundancy, and there’s little scaffolding or synonym churn. Some of the later abstract formulations (“meaning was the mess itself”) flatten the earlier, more embodied strangeness and feel more told than shown. Overall, the prose is polished and publishable, with only minor drift toward overt statement.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, largely free of redundancy, and dense with meaningful information. The figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and thematically aligned (fire, stone, shattering, warmth vs cold), and the prose rarely feels overwrought despite its lyricism. There are a few stacked abstractions (“act of aberrant mercy,” “capacity for tenderness”) and a minor tendency toward repeated conceptual phrasing, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closing image. Overall momentum is well sustained for a reflective piece, with little obvious scaffold or paraphrase looping.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding, tone, and character all at once). Metaphoric language is frequent but usually coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding muddle or redundancy; images of sound-as-color and time-as-threads recur purposefully rather than decoratively. There are very few scaffolding or paraphrase loops; momentum holds through the reflective passages. A couple of phrases flirt with purple or slightly abstract summary (“rising nostalgia flooded the orchard”), but they don’t significantly obscure or blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and minimal redundancies; most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and momentum at once). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and well-aimed, supporting both atmosphere and theme without devolving into purple excess. Rhythm and paragraphing create a pleasing alternation between short, emphatic lines and more sinuous description, sustaining forward movement. I see no significant scaffold or template cadences that dull the closure image; the final paragraph in particular lands cleanly and musically.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and a high ratio of meaningful images to words; lines often do double duty for worldbuilding and theme (e.g., “silence had finally settled over the world like sediment”). There is some repetition of conceptual language (“transitional objects,” “bridge between epochs”) and a mild tendency toward abstraction in later paragraphs, but it rarely stalls momentum. Figurative language usually aligns cleanly with the physical situation and emotional tone. No major scaffolding, synonym loops, or mixed metaphors interfere with clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and efficient: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and meaning, and the rhythm varies nicely. Figurative language is frequent but usually well-chosen and thematically coherent (“stalactites of crystallized resin…like frozen tears,” “patient as honey”). There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or line-level confusions; information flows cleanly. At times the density of metaphor edges toward lush, but it never quite muddies sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished: sentences are varied in length and structure, with strong verbs and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Imagery is mostly precise and disciplined, enriching mood and theme without tipping into purple; the “silver tide / silver hush” motif threads cleanly. Exposition is efficiently folded into action and interiority, and the journey is compressed without feeling skimmed. A few lines lean toward slogan-like wisdom, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory specificity and multi-tasking sentences that build world, mood, and character simultaneously (“The water was still high, still hungry.”). Figurative language is generally precise and not overstacked, and there are no notable loops or scaffolding phrases. The rhythm supports the slow, careful crossing without becoming sluggish. A few high-register coinages (“spindrift serenity”) are borderline ornamental but do not impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, with high information density and images that do more than one job (e.g., smoke as both weather and temporal marker; “memory preserved in amber” tying atmosphere to theme). Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to feel purple, and metaphors don’t conflict; they tend to reinforce bees, light, and ceramics. There are no evident loops, scaffolding phrases, or mechanical cadences, and the final paragraph threads motifs together cleanly. A touch more variation in sentence structure around key realizations could sharpen impact, but overall craft is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied in length, and often do double duty with image and emotion. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and metaphors generally cohere with the harbor/garden lexicon. There is minor conceptual repetition (e.g., reiterating the "light into dark corners" idea explicitly) but not enough to materially drag momentum. The prose carries a smooth read-aloud cadence and lands the closure image cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, dense but mostly purposeful imagery, and a good ratio of scene to summary for this scope. Metaphors are consistent and sensorially legible (tides, stone, clouds, shadow, song), and there’s little scaffold or repetition. A few lines verge on purple or aphoristic, but they don’t obscure action or closure. Overall, the prose carries momentum and atmosphere with minimal waste.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense without being overwrought, and most carry multiple jobs (setting, emotion, and theme at once). Figurative language (“a prayer made stone,” “prismatic quiet”) is vivid and consistent with the established metaphor field of water, light, and spirals; it rarely feels mixed or ornamental. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or clotted metaphor stacks that stall momentum. The closing lines in particular have clear, clean cadence that recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, vivid, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; sensory and conceptual work often share a sentence without clutter. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, atmospheric lines and shorter, punchier ones as the climax nears. Metaphors are mostly clean and apt (“tomb for WXHU’s broadcast equipment,” “farmers… cultivating human discord”), with no noticeable loops or purple excess. While a few formulations feel slightly familiar for SF (entities “vast and ancient”), they don’t materially dull momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally lean, clear, and rhythmic, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (setting, emotion, and motion at once). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and the imagery is coherent with the tone. A few phrases lean on familiar shorthand (“racing heart,” “trembling hands”), but they’re not pervasive enough to drag momentum or originality down. There are no notable loops, scaffolding, or grammatical issues that interfere with propulsion or the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is concise, rhythmic, and image-rich without tipping into purple; lines regularly do double duty advancing setting, character, and theme (“granite walls rising like tombstones,” “truth becomes a matter of architecture”). There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and sentence variety keeps momentum smooth. Figurative language is coherent and patterned—architecture, visibility, mist/silence—rather than scattered or mixed. A few abstract thematic statements could be compressed or more concretely grounded, but line-level craft is strong enough for high-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally lean, varied in rhythm, and pull double duty on atmosphere and information. Metaphors (“settle like sediment,” “the world had exiled its familiar weather”) are apt and not overstacked. There’s minimal redundancy and no major scaffolding or template cadences, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. A few familiar phrases (“best hope,” “weight of understanding”) keep it just shy of elite distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors of light, photography, and bridges are generally controlled and coherent. There is some tilt toward abstraction/purple (“architecture of her life,” “instrument of pure air,” “pixelated grace”), but it rarely obscures sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; there’s very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is controlled and apt (“gallery of possible escapes,” “death rattles” of the company) without drifting into purple. Syntax and paragraphing support momentum across time jumps and land key images crisply at the end. Minor abstractions don’t blur meaning, and nothing significant at the line level undercuts closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level prose is clean, with few redundancies and a good balance between sensory detail and abstraction; images like “letters forming from scattered ink drops” and “nascent light” are effective without becoming purple. Sentences typically do more than one job—advancing plot, mood, and character—and there are no obvious scaffolding loops or template cadences. The main weakness is occasional thematic exposition that could be compressed or embodied instead of explained, slightly flattening momentum in the latter half. Overall, though, rhythm and clarity are strong enough for near-publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and minimal scaffold; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus character). Figurative language is vivid but not overstacked, and there are no noticeable loops or synonym churn. Line rhythm supports momentum, tightening around key beats like the seed’s casting and the confession’s completion. A few phrases are slightly familiar in concept (“storms within her own heart”), but these are rare and don’t significantly dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with strong, specific diction and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, enhancing mood rather than obscuring sense. Information density is high—worldbuilding, character, and theme are efficiently carried in single images or sentences. A couple of slightly abstract phrases (“fragments of possibility,” “collective meaning crystallized”) edge toward vagueness, but they don’t materially blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is tightly crafted with high information density; images like “drinking deep from the calcified remains of ten thousand forgotten dead” do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, theme). Figurative language is rich but controlled, avoiding mixed metaphors and obvious padding. Sentence rhythms vary and carry momentum cleanly into and out of the climax. One could argue for very slight lushness in places, but it does not impede clarity or pace.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally do more than one job (advancing scene, character, and theme at once). Metaphors like “shadows pooled like old regrets” and “stages carved backward into the earth” are apt and coherent, not merely ornamental. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; exposition is tight and purposeful. A faint tendency toward lyrical stacking in a few lines is noticeable but does not impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense without becoming opaque; most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, character, and theme) efficiently. Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (charge, polarity, translation, growth) without stacking into purple muddle. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and action beats are sequenced clearly. One could trim a line or two of explanatory abstraction for even greater sharpness, but line-level craft is already at a strong, near-publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is clean, well-paced, and information-dense: most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously. Figurative language is generally apt and not over-stacked, and there are few if any genuine scaffolding or synonym loops. A couple of abstractions ("the temporal collapse had done this") lean into telling rather than dramatizing, and some closing sentences explain a touch more than necessary. Overall line-by-line craft is strong and publishable, though not yet razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences carry both image and emotional movement. Key metaphors (crystals scattering light, shells as spiral chambers of confession) are coherent and sustained rather than mixed. There is slight redundancy in end-paragraph summations that restate theme, and a few turns edge toward the familiar, but they don’t materially blunt closure. No significant scaffolding, filter stacks, or line-level artifacts impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, information density is high, and there is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is cohesive around rivers, maps, and overgrowth, and does not lapse into mixed metaphors or confusion. A few phrases edge toward the generic (“weight of that failure,” “tentative hope”), and the closing paragraph carries a bit more abstraction than ideal, but clarity and momentum remain intact. With slightly more linguistic surprise and a touch less explicitness in the final lines, this would be elite.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length, many do double duty (worldbuilding + emotion), and there’s very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly well-judged and thematically aligned (time, cycles, breath, light), and it doesn’t obscure basic sense or causality. The closure image (watch ticking forward, gauze lifted, words spoken, path revealed) is clean and well-staged. At times the metaphor density comes close to purple, which gently softens momentum, but it doesn’t materially harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions at once (world-building, emotion, theme), and the rhythm shifts appropriately between contemplative and climactic moments. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and non-redundant—“bruise-colored” velvet, “mulberry ache,” “perforated destiny” all land cleanly without mixed metaphors. There are no meaningful scaffolding loops or template cadences, and copy-level clarity is high. A few images flirt with purple excess, but they don’t blur action or closure, so they’re a minor aesthetic rather than structural issue.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level writing is polished: imagery is largely precise, metaphors are controlled, and most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious padding. There are very few paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. A handful of lines verge on the ornate (“gossamer boundary,” “spark rescued from the edge of forgetting”), but they remain intelligible and on-tone rather than purple or muddled. The final image of the emerald pulsing against her heart is clear, memorable, and free of artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished, with strong imagery, generally tight sentences, and minimal redundancy; most lines do at least two jobs (world, mood, character). The metaphoric density is high but mostly coherent, with very few mixed or strained images. There are a couple of near-ornamental phrases and a mild tendency toward “pretty” in moments that might benefit from sharper, plainer diction to preserve momentum. Overall readability and cadence remain strong, but the prose risks slight over-lushness in a few spots.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is generally lean, musical, and purposeful; most sentences do more than one job, advancing both atmosphere and interior stakes. Figurative language (e.g., “voice thin as sea glass,” “wearing other people's doubts like borrowed coats”) is apt and not overstacked, avoiding purple excess. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase-looping; rhythm varies well between long, lyrical lines and short, declarative ones at hinge moments. No line-level artifacts or muddled metaphors interfere with clarity, especially at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length, images are mostly precise, and information density is high without feeling overstuffed. Figurative language is frequent but purposeful and coherent, with the wave-collision metaphor doing real conceptual work instead of ornament. There’s minimal redundancy, and exposition about the grotto and de-aging is compact. A few phrases lean abstract (“grammar of appearing and disappearing”) but they remain clear in context and don’t impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, information-dense, and generally free of scaffolding or paraphrase loops, with metaphor deployed thoughtfully (“through centuries of layered dust that marked the passage of ages”). The prose balances lyric description with forward motion; even reflective lines tend to reweight the current moment rather than stall it. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; it stays within the established acoustic/bone/dust lexicon, so the metaphoric field feels unified rather than mixed. Minor potential excesses of lushness are more a matter of taste than technical flaw and do not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythm is controlled, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding + mood + character). Figurative language is generally apt and not overstacked, and there are few, if any, true scaffold or paraphrase loops. The imagery of light, mist, and geometry remains coherent across the piece, supporting clarity rather than obscuring it. A few abstractions (“meaning found in the unremarkable”) are slightly expository, but they do not materially slow momentum or muddy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and precise, with images like “meteor hush” and “luminous vows” doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and there’s little to no scaffolding or repetition. Sentences vary in length and structure, and figurative language is rich but rarely overstacked to the point of muddle. Action and reflection balance well for this lyric mode, maintaining momentum through clear causal beats. A few lines approach the border of purple or aphoristic (“Some discoveries signify too much”), but they do not materially obscure closure or sense.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences are generally dense and efficient, often doing double duty for setting, theme, and character, with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is mostly tight and coherent (e.g., light from dying stars “held prisoner”), and the cadence builds smoothly toward the final clear tone and glowing amber. Occasional abstraction (“distill meaning from static,” “contracting memory of spacetime”) is well-motivated by voice, though trimming one or two conceptual phrases could sharpen momentum slightly. There are no noticeable loops, mixed metaphors, or mechanical artifacts to drag the line-level craft down.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length, generally tight, and multi-functional, often carrying setting, emotion, and theme at once. Figurative language (“a reaper drowning in the residue of human regret,” “glass menagerie of fears”) is vivid and mostly precise, with little redundancy or scaffolding. A few phrases tread close to abstraction or repetition of already-implied ideas, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur images. Overall, rhythm and clarity hold up, including at the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images are vivid and coherent, and metaphors around flow/drip/silence are tightly patterned rather than indiscriminately stacked. Information density is high—most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus character or theme) without feeling bloated. Repetition of the dripping motif feels deliberate and structural, not like a loop artifact. I see no significant scaffolding, redundancy, or figurative muddle that would dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and efficient: sentences carry multiple layers (physical setting, emotion, and theme) without feeling bloated, and there are no clarity issues or mixed metaphors. Motifs (water, silence, emergence/submersion) are handled with restraint, and repetition (“precisely humane,” “mirrored hush”) reads intentional rather than accidental. There is very minor abstraction in key insights, but it doesn’t significantly blunt momentum or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, varied sentence structure, and high information density; details often accomplish worldbuilding, character, and theme simultaneously (e.g., the unmelted grave-dew as both scientific oddity and grief talisman). Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and legible, avoiding mixed metaphors or obscuring meaning. There is little to no scaffolding or repetition; paragraphs all shift or deepen something material. At moments the lushness edges close to purple, but it remains under control and aligned with the story’s lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences are generally clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy; the piece reads smoothly aloud. Metaphors are mostly apt (“static faded like breath leaving a body,” “hung in the air like a soundless echo”) and not overstacked. There is some conceptual repetition around “burden,” “patterns,” and “trust” that could be compressed, and a few abstractions at the end feel essayistic. Still, there are no major loops or artifacts, and the final image is clean and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level prose is polished: clear syntax, varied rhythm, and mostly efficient sentences that often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding plus theme plus mood). Images like “civilizations flickering like candlelight” are strong without tipping into purple, and there’s little evidence of scaffolding or redundancy. Some lines drift toward abstraction or overt statement of theme, slightly blunting intensity at peak moments. Overall, the craft is solidly professional, just shy of the striking density and compression that characterize the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, generally concise, and pull multiple weights (setting, character, theme) without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. Metaphors (brook flow, corpse flower’s bloom cycle) are coherent and sustained rather than scattershot, and there are few if any clunky constructions or clarity issues. The main weakness is a mild tendency toward abstraction and thesis-stating in the back third, where some lines tell what images have already implied, slightly blunting momentum. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready with only light tightening needed for maximum tautness.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually multitask (advancing atmosphere, character, and theme together). Figurative language is frequent but mostly clean and purposeful; only a couple of images (“tears adding salt to the sound,” “laughter's possibility pressed against his chest”) edge toward the sentimental. There are no evident loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. The final paragraphs land with a clear, charged image rather than abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are generally clean, and most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme). There is some metaphor density (“interiorizing exteriors,” “like water closing over a stone,” “mist like a sleeping beast”) but the vehicles cohere tonally and do not muddle sense. Minor redundancy in articulating the thematic frame around home and uncertainty slightly blunts momentum near the end. Overall, the prose is polished and publishable with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but generally efficient, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and emotion in one stroke). Figurative language is frequent yet controlled; images are coherent and rarely feel mixed or gratuitous, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There are a few abstract phrases (“adjusting each syllable based on how the metal responded”) that lean explanatory rather than sensorial, but they don’t stall momentum. Overall, line-level craft is solidly publishable and enhances rather than obscures the scene’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and generally do more than one job (worldbuilding, interiority, and theme in the same line). Figurative language is mostly fresh and legible, with only occasional flirtations with purple (“broadcasting on channels the universe was still learning to tune”) that don’t materially harm clarity or momentum. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and the rhythm carries smoothly through the scene to a satisfying cadence. It’s polished and nearly publication-ready on the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences are well-shaped, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and plot without feeling purple. Figurative language is generally fresh and coherent, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. The pacing through the middle—especially the grotto description and the time-split realization—maintains momentum while deepening the conceit. Very slight over-clarifying phrases (“Now she understood it was waiting”) are the only notable places where the line-level could be tightened further.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density—most sentences do double duty in advancing concept and image—and a good rhythmic mix of longer, meditative lines and shorter emphatic ones. Metaphors around weaving, fever, and architecture are coherent and sustained rather than piled on haphazardly. There are mild tendencies toward abstraction and repeated formulations (e.g., variations on “realistically imaginary,” “rational enchantment”) but they function more as motif than as scaffold. I see no major loops, clutter, or figurative muddle that harms momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with images like “teaching someone to paint by numbers when they could have been seeing in color” doing efficient double duty. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances setting, character, or theme. A few phrases lean abstract (“oceans of understanding,” “somber gift of first contact”), but they don’t significantly blunt momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are vivid but not overwrought, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is generally apt and controlled, with a few standout images (“fog pooled like spilled milk,” “edges had gone soft as cloth”) and no mixed metaphors or purple excess. Expository moments about Vera’s method are concise and integrated into the flow without stalling momentum. The prose is excellent but not so formally daring or compressed as to merit the very top scores.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is generally precise and apt, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. A few phrasings (“gift and her curse”) lean on familiar idioms, but they don’t materially dull the closure or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty in advancing mood and theme (“wisdom lived in the wreckage, in the pieces we cannot bring ourselves to throw away”). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and most images are coherent and anchored in the concrete setting. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the closing cadence is especially well-judged. A few lines tilt toward essayistic explanation, but they don’t materially drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense yet clear, images are mostly fresh and coherent, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but not so overstacked as to become purple or obscure causality. The final paragraphs in particular (“The death of the language…,” the walk toward the oldest towers) land with rhythmic and imagistic control, charging prior motifs without over-explaining them.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: vivid but not overstuffed description, purposeful metaphors (stones floating, water spiraling, hope as a hardy plant), and clean syntax. Most sentences do multiple jobs—advancing action, revealing character, and maintaining atmosphere—without obvious scaffolding or loops. There is a mild tendency toward explicit thematic restatement in the final third, but it does not significantly blunt the closing image. No major artifacts, cadence templates, or figurative muddles impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, mostly tight sentences doing double duty for mood and information, and vivid, coherent metaphors (the locust shell, Calcification, apple blossoms falling upward). There’s minimal redundancy; reflection is well-curated and doesn’t stall momentum. The main drag is occasional abstract or summarizing lines that sound like thesis statements more than lived perception, slightly dulling the immediacy in the final third. Still, there are no major artifacts, loops, or figurative muddles, and the closing image lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and carry atmosphere, character, and world-building simultaneously. Figurative language is mostly controlled and purposeful; motifs (storms, absences, stitches) recur in ways that deepen rather than dilute. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or filler sentences; the prose moves cleanly toward the meeting and its aftermath. Occasionally diction edges toward the slightly ornate, but it does not blur sense or slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that often do more than one job (e.g., dust “like incense,” the halo as fragmentary divinity and geometry). Line-level repetition is minimal and most sentences advance character, setting, or tension simultaneously. There are a few moments of near-purple abstraction or minor redundancy, especially around “possibility” and “sanctuary,” but they don’t seriously impede momentum or clarity. Overall, it reads as high-quality, nearly publication-ready line work.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without bloating, and rhythm varies nicely. Figurative language (“triangles with angles summing to more than one hundred eighty degrees,” “wrapped in their observed solitudes like cocoons”) is vivid and generally precise rather than purple. There is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the prose maintains clarity even during surreal turns. A touch of abstraction in the closing paragraph is the only small drag on maximum sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences are clean, well-paced, and information-dense, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every line advances character, concept, or atmosphere. Figurative language is largely apt (“blade of gold,” “luminous absence”) and not over-stacked, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. A few thematic lines veer toward abstraction, but they don’t obscure sense or dull the closure image. Overall, the prose is polished to a near-publishable level with no significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.7)
    The line-level work is generally strong, with vivid metaphors (“time… dripping from the edges of starlight like honey from a broken comb”) and good information density. There is some stacking of figurative language and abstraction that edges toward purple but rarely tips into confusion. Sentences mostly do double duty—advancing story and mood—without obvious scaffolding or loops. Slight tightening of a few high-level formulations would sharpen momentum and prevent occasional thematic redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lean yet rich, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once) and very little scaffolding or repetition. Rhythm modulates well—longer, descriptive lines during approach and shorter, more focused ones as she discovers and opens the jar—without any noticeable template cadence. Figurative language is controlled, coherent, and thematically apt; no mixed metaphors or purple clusters dull the climax. It’s not quite jaw-dropping at every line, but the line-level craft is clearly at or near publishable quality for a top venue.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is polished: images are vivid yet disciplined, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors like the shadow in glass and “measured not in days but in silences” are fresh and coherent, without stacking to purple excess. There’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or clumsy syntax; rhythm reads smoothly aloud. A handful of lines border on aphoristic, but they remain grounded enough in the scene to avoid feeling like ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, efficient imagery, and a good ratio of telling to showing for this mythic mode. Recurrent terms (“wonder,” “essence,” “threshold”) build a deliberate lexicon rather than feeling like synonym churn, and there are no significant clarity lapses. At times, the language drifts close to the purple—particularly in stacked abstractions about beauty and dreaming—but it generally stops short of muddling sense. Line-level craft is clearly publication-ready, even if not formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and information-dense; nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and tonally apt, with minimal overwriting or mixed metaphors. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or clunky transitions, and the final paragraphs in particular land with clarity and impact. A few metaphors (“a thousand quiet wounds”) border on lush, but they do not obscure sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and evocative metaphors that mostly land cleanly (“evidence of a crime committed by time itself,” “forgotten intentions”). Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and descriptive passages usually advance atmosphere and theme rather than stalling momentum. There is a mild tendency toward lushness and the occasional near-redundant echo, but it doesn’t cross into muddled or overwrought. The closing lines are clear and concentrated, successfully recharging prior images (rain, silence, maps, stones) without figurative confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally precise, image-rich, and purposeful, with minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors (“books had become coral,” “grief was not a anchor but a current”) are vivid and mostly coherent, though a few verge on polished aphorism. Prose density is high but not so lush as to blur clarity or momentum. Minor abstraction creep in the final third keeps this from the very highest band but does not materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, and character) without obvious redundancy or scaffold, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent with the story’s aesthetic; metaphors of encoding, petals, and light remain internally consistent. There are no noticeable loops, syntactic templates, or register jolts, and the cadence varies appropriately between atmospheric description and climactic singing. Density stays high without becoming opaque, particularly in the closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is polished, with varied syntax, clean mechanics, and imagery that is generally precise and evocative (“pale blue nothing,” ice walls as prisms, crystalline jars of golden light). Most sentences do more than one job—advancing setting, emotion, and theme together—which keeps momentum strong despite a reflective mode. There are mild tendencies toward the decorative or abstract in a few spots, but not enough to obscure clarity or dull the closing image. No significant loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors disrupt the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and images that generally pull double duty for mood and theme. Figurative language (e.g., “clouds gather like old griefs,” “dusty starlight filtering through atmospheric haze”) is fresh and consistent with the piece’s register. Redundancies are minimal, and exposition is compressed rather than flabby. The main limitation is that a couple of thematic statements verge on abstraction, softening the impact of otherwise excellent imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is generally elegant: high information density, purposeful imagery (fractals, rings, constellations), and clean grammar and sequencing. The prose sustains a lyrical register without collapsing into confusion, and most metaphors are coherent and thematically relevant. There is mild risk of over-decoration—several sentences stack abstraction and philosophy such that momentum dips—but it doesn’t seriously obscure causality or the closure image. Trimming a handful of explanatory lines would likely sharpen the already strong cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is generally elegant and controlled, with strong verbs, concrete images, and minimal scaffolding; paragraphs almost always add new information or deepen tone. Metaphors (“like ink dissolving in water,” “breath from cold lips”) are vivid yet not overstacked, and there are few if any paraphrase loops. The prose does tend mildly toward a consistent lush register that risks feeling uniformly pretty, which slightly dulls momentum in what could be sharper pressure beats. Nonetheless, clarity is excellent and the final image lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with few redundancies and a good mix of sentence lengths that support momentum in a quiet, lyric way. Metaphors are generally coherent and thematically linked to time, cold, and memory; they rarely feel mixed or gratuitous. There is some density of figurative language and repeated syntactic patterns (“like X”) that flirt with purple, but they don’t significantly obscure sense or dull the closure beat. Overall, information density, rhythm, and clarity are strong enough to be near-publishable with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are clear, and most lines carry more than one function (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus character). Figurative language like “nebula of respite,” “living stardust,” and “brambled hope” is evocative without becoming overgrown, and the rhythm of paragraphs gives the piece a measured cadence. A few phrases edge toward abstraction or mild repetition (“peace, Elara had learned, required tending”; explicit definition of hope), which introduces a touch of didacticism. Overall, momentum and clarity are well maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, most do more than one job, and there is very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and coherent, rarely slipping into mixed metaphors or obscuring sense. Phrases like “painting the glass in shades of amber and bruise” and “a pane of hush—a window into silence so profound it held echoes of every sound ever made” exemplify high-density but clear prose. The main risk is a mild drift toward purple in places, though it does not materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is clean, economical, and often elegant (“offhandedly exact precision,” “their copper warnings,” “graceless beauty”). Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and almost all carry more than one job (world, mood, or character) without padding. There’s no obvious looping, scaffolding, or metaphor muddle, and the prose stays clear under pressure. It’s very solid and publication-ready, though not quite at the level of stylistic audacity or compression that would push into the 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, and the recurring imagery feels patterned rather than repetitive. Figurative language (braiding, foam, translation) is coherent and thematically integrated, without lapsing into purple or muddle. Some abstractions (“the divergent path she had walked,” “translating separation into connection”) edge toward summary, but they don’t significantly dull momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and mostly do double-duty (worldbuilding plus character or theme), with few if any redundancies. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent (“clouds swirl like cream dissolving in coffee,” “each incision was a question mark”), avoiding mixed metaphors. There is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. One could argue for a touch of conceptual abstraction in places, but it does not significantly slow momentum or obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images like “metallic tang of her mother’s final regret” and “stone walls weeping moisture” are vivid and multi-functional. The prose balances lyricism with clarity; most sentences do double duty for character and atmosphere without looping or redundancy. Rhythm varies well across paragraphs, and there are no major metaphor clashes or syntactic artifacts that impede momentum. A slight density of figurative language in places keeps it just short of exemplary minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs (world, character, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent (e.g., “borrowed starlight,” “bridges from silos”) and rarely feels mixed or purple. There’s mild explanatory redundancy around her motivation and the town’s divisions, but it doesn’t significantly slow momentum or muddy the closing image. Line-level craft is clearly publishable in a competitive venue.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and generally economical; most sentences carry two or more jobs (world-building plus emotional or thematic charge). Metaphoric language (“calcified memories,” “earth’s forgotten autobiography”) is coherent and controlled rather than cluttered. There is minor repetition of key phrases and a mild lushness that verges on purple but doesn’t obscure sense or momentum. The line-level craft is strong but lacks the razor-edged compression and risk of the very best literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is largely clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Imagery such as “the mist pooled like luminescent milk” and “paths of luminescence tracing connections between carved symbols” is vivid without tipping into muddle. There is some mild conceptual repetition around her “prism-minded” nature and the guardianship insight, but it doesn’t significantly stall momentum. Line-level craft is strong and nearly publication-ready, though a light pass for tightening a few explanatory sentences could further sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and dense with information, often doing double duty (worldbuilding plus theme, or image plus character). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent (“invisible tide,” “music bloomed inside her bones”), and it doesn’t significantly blur sense or momentum. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase-looping; each paragraph advances situation, understanding, or atmosphere. A few abstractions (“empathy in motion,” “sympathy in the wood”) flirt with discursiveness, but they don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, clean syntax, and high information density; images like “bruised violets and fading gold” or the basalt absorbing twilight feel precise and apt. Line-level repetition of certain phrases (“thoughtfully precise,” “translating silence,” “correlating”) occasionally brushes against redundancy but mostly reads as deliberate motif rather than scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent yet generally coherent and not so dense as to blur sense or momentum. Overall it’s solidly literary, with only minor risks of over-articulation in thematic sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: varied rhythms, multi-tasking sentences, and vivid metaphors that usually clarify rather than blur. The prose sustains atmosphere and momentum without obvious scaffolding or repetition loops. That said, figurative density is high, and some abstractions (“path to empathy,” “space where understanding waited to be born”) stack toward purple, especially near the end. A touch more restraint and concrete embodiment in the closing reflections would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and economical for this length, with many sentences doing double duty (world, character, theme) and few obvious scaffolding lines. Sensory images (“wildflower hush,” “decay wrapped in sweetness”) are concrete and mostly well-chosen, with only occasional mild purple notes. There’s no evident synonym-churn, structural looping, or figurative muddle that obscures sense, and grammar/punctuation are clean. A slight tendency toward stacked abstractions in thematic sentences is the main limiter.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is clean and efficient: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, motion) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Rhythm varies smoothly between longer, descriptive lines and shorter, pressure-bearing ones (e.g., the countdown beats). Figurative language is controlled and coherent; there are no mixed metaphors or purple stretches that obscure sense, and closure imagery remains crisp. A few abstractions (“source of resilience,” “collective longing”) could be grounded a shade more in concrete experience, but they don’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors (heart, respiratory system, language of accidents) are consistent with the story’s conceptual frame and don’t conflict or over-accumulate. A few phrases verge on reiteration of the same idea (“the wind speaks first” and its paraphrases), but they mostly read as purposeful motif rather than loop. The prose flows smoothly enough for immediate publication, though a ruthless line edit could trim a handful of slightly expository sentences about management’s attitude or her methodology.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt (“her breath crystallizing into brief diamonds,” “frozen congregants,” “sculpted hush”), and it rarely feels redundant or muddled. There is minimal scaffold or paraphrase looping, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. At the very highest bar, some abstractions (“certified wonder,” “conceptual hush from which all meaningful sound emerged”) could be sharpened into more concrete, scene-tied language.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; most lines do at least double duty for mood and plot. Images like “avalanchingly quiet” and “spaces between worlds, the thin places where reality grew permeable” feel fresh without straining. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there are no noticeable paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences that could be cut without loss. The final cadence is crisp and charged, bringing back key motifs without sounding mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “sky hemorrhaging light” and “loss multiplied by memory, divided by time’s cruel asymptote” are vivid and thematically on-point. Most sentences do multiple jobs at once (world-building, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The density of figurative language is high but largely controlled; only a few moments drift toward conceptual summary rather than image, and there are no mixed metaphors that break the spell. Rhythm and clarity hold through the ending, keeping momentum despite the reflective, lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, mostly concise, and information-dense, with sensory and conceptual content often doing double duty. Figurative language (“spine of ancient stone,” “song in silence”) is generally apt and not overstacked to the point of muddle. There’s minor conceptual repetition around “wonder,” “sacred,” and the job redefinition, and a few lines border on thematic paraphrase, but they don’t significantly drag momentum. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and there are no distracting technical errors.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that usually do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Metaphors like “silence relocated” and “emotional archaeology of ordinary things” are striking yet coherent with the story’s conceptual frame. There is some stylistic lushness that borders on purple, but it doesn’t tangle clarity or stall momentum, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. The final paragraphs land on concrete sensory shifts (melting frost, cool prism, parting mist) that give the abstraction a grounded cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, metaphor chains are mostly coherent, and almost every line does double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Phrases like “raveling silence” and “thin enough to slip between the weave of reality” are striking without collapsing into muddle. There is a mild tendency toward density (“stoically sparkling” appears twice and edges toward self-consciousness), but it doesn’t obscure action or stakes. Momentum remains steady despite the lyrical mode, with no notable redundancy or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: strong verbs, varied syntax, and high information density with minimal redundancy, and the prose largely avoids clunky scaffolding or obvious loops. Figurative language (“poured knowledge into him like molten metal into a mold,” “cathedral of petrified wood”) is apt and grounded in the story’s material vocabulary. The only notable weakness is a mild tilt toward didactic abstraction in the final moralizing lines, where the prose drifts from image into essay. Overall it’s publishable-quality line work with a small thematic-prose misstep at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally concise, with good sentence-level rhythm and a decent blend of image and information. Most lines do at least two jobs (world-building plus emotional or conceptual charge), and momentum is maintained without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. A few phrases lean generic or explanatory (“the truth she sought had weight,” “finally understanding the price of the gift”), dulling the sharpness of otherwise strong images. No serious figurative muddle or structural artifacts impede clarity, but there’s room to trim minor abstraction and let concrete images carry more of the load.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is tight: sentences are varied, crisp, and information-dense, with little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is selective and generally clear, enriching mood rather than obscuring sense. There are occasional slightly familiar constructions (“the ache of carrying light you cannot keep”), but they’re outweighed by sharper, original turns. Rhythm supports the piece’s accumulating pressure, slowing for reflection and tightening at key choices without bogging down.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, imagery is vivid, and most lines do double-duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. Metaphors (“stars pressed close… like curious children,” “her voice a symphony of thunder and joy”) are apt and not over-mixed. There is some repetition of concepts (old ways/compact/humanity forgot) but not enough to drag momentum. Overall, the prose is polished to near-publishable quality in an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and largely free of redundancy, with most images earning their place. Metaphors like “quietly explosive” and “cracked people open gently, like seeds” are vivid and apt without stacking into purple prose. A couple of phrases are a touch declarative or familiar (“second chance,” “borrowed life”), but they don’t significantly dull momentum or clarity. Overall, the prose shows good rhythm and precision, with no major artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and musical, imagery is precise, and nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Figurative language is present but controlled, and there are no noticeable scaffold sentences, loops, or muddled metaphors. The prose sustains momentum even while delivering conceptual exposition about dreams, units of sorrow, and arboreal memory. It is very nearly publication-ready at a rigorous market with minimal line edits.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with high information density and minimal scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences do more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and character in tandem). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and controlled, and momentum is not bogged down by loops or explanatory padding. Occasional near-cliché images and a fairly uniform lushness of tone in all beats keep it just shy of exceptional compression and variety.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lean yet evocative, with strong images like “stones surfacing in still water” and “carrying her contradictions like lanterns” doing multiple jobs at once. Sentences are varied in length and structure, supporting momentum without feeling mechanical, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is selective and controlled, rarely tipping into purple; abstractions are anchored in concrete detail (clock, shelves, invitation, utility door). Line-level clarity remains high through the climax and closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, largely free of redundancy, and often do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and character) at once. Imagery is concrete and measured—steam, frost, vines, stale sweetness—without overloading the page with metaphor. A few abstractions and near-synonymous restatements of the central idea of erasure/forgetting mildly blunt momentum in the middle. Overall propulsion is appropriate for a quiet, reflective story, and the final sentences land clearly and musically.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally elegant, with high information density—sentences often advance setting, tone, and theme simultaneously. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and there are no serious clarity issues or scaffolding loops. However, the frequency of elevated metaphors and abstract formulations (“colors that had no names,” “edge of oblivion”) edges into mild purple in places, especially when paired with explicit thematic statements. Trimming a few ornamental flourishes and letting more concrete particulars carry the weight could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and strong verbs, and most images pull double duty for mood and world-building. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to blur sense, and metaphors are coherent with the world’s logic. There is little to no scaffolding or synonym churn; each paragraph tends to advance either plot, character, or atmosphere. A few turns of phrase edge toward the familiar (e.g., “circling like sharks”), but they are outweighed by fresher constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, clean syntax, and vivid metaphors that mostly avoid strain (“tasting copper and ozone,” “chlorophyll sharp as ambition”). The lyricism is sustained without obvious loops or scaffolding; sentences rarely repeat ideas without adding nuance. A few phrases flirt with over-ornateness (“terrestrially cosmic,” “futuristic nostalgia”) but they remain legible and tonally consistent rather than purple for its own sake. Momentum is appropriate for an accumulative, reflective piece, with no confusing artifacts at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (scene, emotion, theme), syntax is varied, and there is little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are mostly coherent and apt, though a few moments (“crystals… pulsed with approval,” “uncorked creativity”) flirt with sentimentality and purple prose. The density of figurative language remains under control and does not obscure clarity or causality. A slight tightening of overtly symbolic or explanatory lines would elevate this to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and image) without bloat, and the rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language is vivid but not overstacked, and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases that could be easily cut. Occasional explanatory lines (“The map revealed her mother’s lifelong obsession…”) are slightly flatter than the surrounding prose and could be rendered more dynamically, but they do not significantly drag momentum. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and both the opening and closing images are well-composed.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and images that usually do more than one job (e.g., “color of wonder” as both concrete and thematic). Syntax varies, and the rhythm supports the contemplative mood without dragging. While the language is lush, it avoids true purple; metaphors are coherent and reinforcing, and there’s little redundancy or scaffold. A touch more spareness at peaks could sharpen impact, but line-level craft is clearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the story is concise, rhythmically varied, and largely free of scaffolding or repetition; most sentences do more than one job. Figurative language is frequent but mostly sharp and coherent, with only an occasional familiar turn (“something terrible and true”) that doesn’t impede clarity. Action sequences (fire, compression, burial) are cleanly rendered without mechanical clutter, and syntax supports momentum. There’s no significant looping or purple excess, and the final image lands cleanly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, evocative, and purposeful, with strong images like “seventeen years of silence in her palm” and “colors bleed from gray to gold” doing multiple jobs at once. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and syntax is clean; the piece reads smoothly aloud. A few abstractions and mildly familiar metaphors (“guilt like a dog on a leash,” “wrong note in familiar music”) feel less fresh but don’t materially dull momentum or clarity. Line-level craft is strong enough for a high-tier venue with only light trimming needed for maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often do double duty with atmosphere and character. Metaphors (“sediment…like snow,” “carried her fear like a torch”) are mostly apt and reinforcing rather than mixed. There is mild redundancy around the fear/vulnerability thesis and a few phrases verge on purple, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or blur sense. The final image is clear and charged, with no major scaffolding or loop artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing plot, deepening character, and carrying imagery. Metaphors around light, salt, and silence are coherent and not over-stacked to the point of muddle. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; information flows cleanly and momentum rarely stalls, even during brief expository passages. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, image-rich sentences and shorter, declarative turns at key beats (“Mira opened the book.” / “The sphere cracked open.”).

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and generally do double duty for mood and meaning. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, and there’s little in the way of loops or scaffolding redundancies. A few constructions (“tranquil blaze,” “terrestrially cosmic”) brush purple but don’t obstruct clarity or closure. The final paragraphs land cleanly and rhythmically without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, economical, and often beautiful—images like “her silver hair catching starlight” and “translucent as old curtains” are vivid without tipping into purple. Sentences do multiple jobs at once (advancing scene, character, and theme), and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Rhythm varies well between shorter declaratives and more sinuous lines, supporting the contemplative pressure. It very nearly meets a “publish now” standard line by line, with only minor room to sharpen a few abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and image-rich without tipping into full purple; details usually carry multiple jobs (world, mood, character). Sentences vary in length and structure, and there are few, if any, true loops or scaffolding artifacts. Some phrase choices (“tragically radiant,” “translated her isolation into something stronger”) edge toward thematic shorthand rather than concrete embodiment, slightly blunting impact. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publishable, if not quite at a once-in-a-decade level.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with imagery that usually does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme simultaneously). Metaphors are coherent and aligned with the setting and mood, with minimal redundancy or scaffolding; there are no major loops or clarity issues. At times the language skirts the edge of purple, but it rarely tips into muddle, maintaining momentum through a reflective mode. The closing sentence elegantly gathers prior motifs (stalactites, endurance, peace) into a clean cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is lean for its lyric mode: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Rhythm varies pleasantly, and the narrative avoids synonym loops, stock metaphors, or clotted modifiers. Minor issues include occasional conceptual phrases that feel slightly expository in tone compared to the otherwise textural diction, and a couple of near-redundant ideas about webs, conspiracies, and silence that could be compressed. These are small trims rather than structural debts; the closure image remains sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and most images pull double duty for mood and theme. Figurative language is generally coherent and purposeful, with no major metaphor tangles or noticeable scaffolding loops. A few abstractions and thematic tells could be compressed or made more image-driven, but they don’t significantly drag momentum. The final paragraphs in particular are clean, musical, and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, well-shaped, and information-dense, with imagery that is precise rather than bloated. Repetition is purposeful (hidden effort, patterns, rain) rather than accidental, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or slack phrases. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, and key metaphors cohere with the story’s pattern-mind frame. A touch of explanatory phrasing in the expository lines slightly dulls momentum, but it doesn’t meaningfully harm clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, efficient, and usually carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, and atmosphere) without much scaffolding or redundancy. Imagery like the fractured diamond and colorless horizon is concrete and legible, and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. There are a few mildly expository or summarizing moves (“Maya began to intuit the shape of the larger conspiracy”) that flatten immediacy, and some metaphors are serviceable rather than sharp. Still, line-level craft is clearly above average and never obscures causality or dulls the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: compressed, metaphorically inventive, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language (“forgotten god’s monocle,” “gritty whimsy,” “lyrically prophetic in its destruction”) is fresh and generally purposeful, enriching tone and theme. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, sustaining momentum while allowing for reflective pauses without stalling. A few phrases approach ornamental, but they do not obscure clarity or the closure image, so their impact is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and structure, images tend to be clear and concrete, and almost every line either advances character or enriches atmosphere. A few abstractions and thematic paraphrases could be tightened, and there’s a marginal tilt toward purple at times, but clarity and momentum are never seriously compromised. Figurative language generally lands cleanly without mixed metaphors or density overload. The final paragraph in particular offers a clean, charged cadence without visible scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythm, high information density, and images that often do double duty for mood and world-building. Occasional purple touches and paired metaphors (“fleshly ethereal,” “being unmade and reassembled at the molecular level, fleshly and ethereal simultaneously”) verge on redundancy, but they don’t obscure meaning. There is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; most lines advance either pressure or atmosphere. Tightening a handful of figurative phrases would elevate it to a more austere, publish-ready polish.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“The sanctuary's stone walls held the cold like a memory”). There’s good variation in sentence length and little in the way of scaffolding or redundancy; information density is high without becoming opaque. A few phrases verge on familiar or slightly purple (“burning with useless rage,” “like a stone in her chest”), and thematic lines repeat similar ideas about patience and erosion. These are minor slips, but paring a couple of near-duplicate metaphors would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean, varied in sentence length, and generally high in information density, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Imagery is mostly precise and restrained; repeated motifs like vibration, rain, and tunnels are reused rather than multiplied. There are mild patches of abstraction or slogan-like phrasing (“fortified vulnerability,” “systematically dispersed, impossible to suppress”) that feel more conceptual than lived, slightly dulling momentum and texture. Still, there are no major artifacts or loops, and the final image of emerging into a “rain-washed night” ties the language together effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-by-line craft is polished: images are precise and consistent (“gears frozen mid-turn like a life caught between breaths”) without piling into purple prose. Sentences do multiple jobs—advancing setting, character, and theme together—with very little redundancy or scaffolding. Rhythm varies and key beats are given crisp, uncluttered phrasing, especially when emotional stakes surface. The only slight limitation is an occasional metaphor or thematic echo that edges toward explicitness, but it does not blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are vivid, sentences are varied, and most metaphors are coherent and in-voice, doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme. The opening and closing lines are particularly sharp and well-weighted. There is a noticeable density of figurative language throughout, which occasionally brushes against purple-prose territory but doesn’t seriously obscure clarity or pacing. Information is generally efficient, with minimal scaffolding or repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with very little scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are apt and coherent, and recurring phrases (ghosts, forgotten songs, numbers) feel patterned rather than redundant. Expository passages about Marcus and Artemis-7 compress complex backstory without bogging momentum. A touch more syntactic risk or compression at peak pressure could elevate it further, but there are no major artifacts dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with strong images ("clung to the cliff's edge like a prayer refusing to be forgotten") and good information density—most sentences do double duty for setting, mood, and character. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and generally coherent; there are no mixed metaphors that obscure meaning, and momentum is maintained despite the lyrical texture. Redundancy is minimal, and the final paragraph lands a clear, charged image without clutter. The only minor drawback is occasional abstract phrasing in the thematic lines, which slightly lowers sharpness but not clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple layers of work (plot, theme, atmosphere) with little scaffolding or redundancy, and rhythm varies effectively. Metaphoric language (“time moving in stutters rather than streams,” “fold in patience”) is mostly fresh and coherent with the conceit. A few repetitions of phrasing around “endings,” “patience,” and “waiting” come close to thematic echo but do not seriously drag momentum or blur clarity. Overall density and propulsion are well-calibrated for a contemplative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “vines twisted like arthritic hands” and the pavilion as a “lantern holding its breath” are vivid and apt. Sentences carry multiple jobs—advancing scene, mood, and character—without notable redundancy. Rhythm varies well, and there’s little scaffolding or explanatory padding. The main minor flaw is an occasional register shift toward theoretical language that feels less embodied than the surrounding prose.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight and image-rich without spilling into purple; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus character or theme). Rhythm varies nicely and the line-level clarity is high; action order and causality remain easy to follow. There are a few slightly familiar turns (“sand and memory in equal measure”) but no real metaphor muddle or scaffolding loops that sap momentum. The closing paragraphs in particular are clean, with a strong cadence and minimal redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: the prose is rhythmic, image-dense, and mostly free of redundancy or scaffolding, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with sustained metaphors (maps, arcs, vines) rather than random flourishes, and syntax varies enough to keep the piece from feeling mechanical. A few abstractions (“perceptively calm,” “portable shrine to unfinished gestures”) verge on preciousness but don’t obscure sense or momentum. There are no significant clarity issues, loops, or grammatical slips that touch the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, dense with information, and largely free of scaffolding or repetition that doesn’t earn its keep; images like “weathered innocence…worn smooth like river stones” feel precise rather than generic. Figurative language is present but not stacked to the point of muddling clarity, and syntax remains clear and propulsive despite the reflective mode. There are no apparent grammar or rhythm artifacts, and nearly every sentence advances character, world, or theme. The only slight limiter is that the lexical richness is fairly uniform, which flattens dynamic range a bit under emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and mostly free of redundancy; many sentences carry multiple jobs of setting, character, and theme at once. Metaphors (fog nets, unwatched tapes, static-corrupted photographs) are coherent and mutually reinforcing rather than decorative. A few conceptual phrases (“tidal longing,” “accumulating unwatched hours”) sit close to abstraction but are anchored enough in image to avoid purple-prose territory. Momentum stays intact despite the lyric density, with no clear scaffold or paraphrase loops that could be cleanly cut.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and sonorous, with strong image density—“prayer frozen in stone,” “sound like a whispered secret,” “luminous dark”—that generally pulls its weight in advancing mood and theme. Sentence rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy; most lines do dual work. There is a mild tendency toward stacked abstractions and reiterated motifs (ephemeral, luminous, changelessly constant) that inch toward purple but stop short of obscuring clarity. Tightening a few of the more declarative or metaphor-heavy lines would sharpen impact without losing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level writing is polished and efficient: most sentences do at least two jobs (advancing scene while carrying theme or atmosphere), and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and apt (“light poured through every surface like honey through gauze,” “dust motes swimming in sunbeams”), with no major metaphor clashes. A few lines approach explanatory abstraction (“This was her work: not to eliminate fear, but to companion it…”) but remain clear and character-consistent. Rhythm and clarity hold through the closing beat, supporting rather than smothering the emotional turn.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, and most images (“flower remembering spring,” “spaces between stars”) are apt. There is some repetition of concepts (“quietly deliberate,” relearning runes) and a light touch of purple at times, but not enough to stall momentum. Exposition about changed runes and reality is folded in efficiently, and there are no major scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The final paragraph tilts slightly toward summary, yet still lands with a clean, charged image of work continuing into false dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is controlled: sentences are clear, flow well, and often do double duty advancing plot and theme (“She had spent her career setting broken bones; now she would set broken beliefs…”). Figurative language is generally apt, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffold. A few phrases read slightly purple or labored (“shrewdly innocent in her trespass,” “turn sorrow into stars”), and the “she would” future-tense sequence risks minor repetition. These are small slips in otherwise publishable prose.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, and exposition) with little scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythm of longer descriptive lines against shorter pivots works well. Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined and coherent—glass, light, and water-related images recur in an intentional pattern, and mixed metaphors are avoided. There are no notable loops or template cadences, and syntax remains clear even in reflective passages. A slight trim of a couple of near-synonymous insights about grief and light could heighten concision, but momentum is largely preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“columns wrapped in ferns,” “carpets of emerald velvet”) and minimal redundancy; most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, character, theme). Rhythm varies well between longer lyric descriptions and tighter emotional beats around the pendant and Thea. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple drift; “honeyed hush” and the thaw pattern are especially effective. I see no noticeable scaffolding loops or artifacts, and the final line lands with clear, uncluttered impact.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with high information density: most sentences carry character, world, and theme simultaneously. Imagery is rich but not so stacked as to become purple, and metaphors are coherent with the story’s water/spiral/book lexicon. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or cadence templates, and the final image (“bright as a shell lifted from dark water”) crisply resolves earlier motifs. A hair more restraint in explicitly thematic lines would move it into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and readable, with varied sentence rhythms and generally high information density; most lines advance image, emotion, or concept. Figurative language is present but not excessive, and key images (moon, tendril, golden stories) recur with purpose. There are a few mild redundancies and familiar phrases that could be sharpened, yet no major loops, purple stacks, or syntactic glitches. Momentum holds throughout, particularly impressive given the essentially static physical situation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong information density—lines routinely advance atmosphere, character, and concept at once. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned (world as map, bowl, vessel), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. Rhythm varies nicely between long, meditative sentences and sharper pivots at key beats (the vial opening, the flare, the aurora’s movement). There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; most sentences feel necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but not excessive, and metaphors (like “the wounded season” and “cellar of reason”) are coherent and sustained. There are no notable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic tics that drag momentum. A few abstractions could be sharpened into image, but line-level craft is comfortably in the publishable range.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is highly polished: images are precise, metaphors coherent, and most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or setting plus theme). Figurative density is high but patterned and purposeful, never collapsing into mush or obscuring what is literally happening. There are no evident loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic tics; rhythm varies naturally with the contemplative pace. Closing lines elegantly reprise earlier language without redundancy, keeping momentum through the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Recurrent phrases and metaphors (harvesting lessons, crystallized time) are intentional motifs rather than accidental loops, though a couple of thesis-like lines border on over-articulation. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. It’s elegant and controlled, if a shade more explicit in a few thematic statements than the imagery alone requires.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, pull multiple weights (worldbuilding, theme, and character), and rarely feel redundant. Figurative language is mostly apt and purposeful, with no significant metaphor muddle, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym churn. A handful of phrases verge on thematic slogan (“ambition doesn't erode from wisdom”), but they don’t significantly dull momentum or clarity. The opening and closing images are especially tight and well-shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences carry atmosphere, characterization, and theme simultaneously. Metaphors (“cathedral of forgotten departures,” “maze of intentions”) are apt and consistently extended rather than mixed. Occasional direct statements of idea (“functionally creative decision,” “spaces designed for hope”) edge toward abstraction but don’t significantly blunt momentum or clarity. Overall, line-level craft meets a high standard suitable for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and vivid, mostly disciplined figurative language; images like “memories surfaced like oil on water” or the forecourt catching tears are striking and clear. Sentence rhythm is varied and paragraphs generally earn their space, with minimal scaffolding or repetition. There is mild tendency toward lushness and repeated adjectives or constructions (“excruciatingly gentle,” “glacial”) that occasionally feel one notch too ornamental, but they don’t obscure clarity or dull the ending. No significant line-level artifacts or logical slips impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, varied, and largely free of scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and grounded in the story’s motifs (time, architecture, twilight, water). A few abstractions (“entire histories stood on foundations of fabricated stone”) flirt with over-explanation but don’t bog momentum or blur sense. Line-level clarity remains high through the ending, supporting rather than dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, doing double duty for atmosphere and character without obvious padding or scaffolding. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, with motifs (seeds, rope, glass, fog) returning instead of scattershot metaphors. There are no significant loops, syntactic tics, or register clashes, and the final paragraph lands with a clean, resonant image. The only small limitation is that a few explanatory lines about philosophy and preservation lean more expository than necessary, slightly softening the otherwise razor-sharp concision.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and structure, carry multiple functions (character, atmosphere, theme), and flow cleanly from one to the next. Figurative language is mostly precise and apt, with only occasional phrases (“geography of healing”) approaching abstraction but still justified by the conceit. There’s little to no scaffolding, paraphrase looping, or syntactic monotony, and key images (thread, leaves, lanterns) are refreshed rather than repeated flatly. The prose sustains momentum in a reflective mode without feeling padded or purple.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and evocative metaphors that mostly land cleanly (“frozen tear,” “bones of dead gods,” “scheduled contentment”). Prose generally propels rather than stalls, and paragraphs do real work. There is a mild tendency toward purple richness—figurative language in many consecutive lines—but it rarely muddies meaning or closure. A touch more spareness around the climax could heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (image, theme, and character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. Figurative language is dense but generally coherent and specific, with very few mixed or strained metaphors. A few phrases are somewhat self-conscious or concept-heavy (“unending compassion for their own survival,” “transformed but not erased”), but they do not significantly blur sense or stall momentum. The final paragraphs land cleanly, with the last line effectively echoing earlier motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, vivid, and largely free of redundancy, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once). Figurative language is frequent but mostly well-chosen and coherent, supporting the atmosphere instead of smothering it. Syntax varies enough to keep momentum, and the story avoids obvious scaffolding or template phrasing. Any mild purple-tinged moments don’t materially drag clarity or pace, especially around the climax and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious redundancy, and the metaphors cohere around stars, light, and growth. The prose edges into lushness, yet rarely feels overwrought or confusing; images like “colors that existed only in the spaces between stars” and “sorrows like seeds pressed between the pages” are clear and apt. There are no visible loops, clumsy scaffolds, or syntactic glitches, and the closure image is sharp. A few moments could arguably be tightened for elite venues, but they don’t materially dull momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“iron bones wrapped in glass,” “the space inside a cupped hand”) that generally carry multiple layers of work—setting, mood, and theme. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and exposition is compact; almost every line advances atmosphere or meaning. There is a high density of figurative language, but metaphors are coherent and not contradictory, and repetition doesn’t slip into scaffolding. A touch more restraint in the final third might sharpen impact further, but nothing significantly blurs clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, vivid, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty in atmosphere and character without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“blade of frozen night,” “slow arithmetic of the soul”) is generally controlled and thematically apt, with no mixed metaphors that muddy sense. A few phrases edge toward the rhetorical (“nature of incremental absolution,” “liturgy of acknowledged wrongs”), but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur the climax. Line-level craft is excellent but not quite at the startling, sentence-by-sentence brilliance of the very top range.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clean grammar, and sentences that often carry multiple functions (image, character, theme) at once. Metaphors like “velveteen gloom” and “notes in a visual music” are fresh and mostly well-judged. There is a slight tendency toward stacked abstractions in the last paragraphs, where theme is reiterated a bit too directly. Still, there are no major loops or artifacts, and momentum holds for this quiet mode.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished, with strong openings (“The obsidian spire rose from the frozen lake like a black tooth…”) and clean, varied sentences that balance description, thought, and action. Figurative language is purposeful and not overstacked; there are few to no paraphrase loops or filler constructions. A handful of lines summarize theme or process at a higher level of abstraction than necessary, but they don’t materially slow momentum or obscure closure. Line-by-line craft is solidly publication-ready, even if not stylistically jaw-dropping.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions (world, mood, character) at once, and avoid scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and coherent (mist “heavy as velvet,” dust as memory-laden), with only occasional brush-ups against sentimentality in the final lines. Momentum is well maintained for a quiet piece, and there are no grammatical or clarity issues that impede causality or the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and typically do more than one job (advancing atmosphere, theme, and character simultaneously). Figurative language is coherent and controlled; recurrent motifs of distance, vanishing, and fragmentation are handled without sliding into purple prose. There are a few slightly abstract or expository lines, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure the closure image. The final paragraph in particular lands with a clean, resonant cadence that echoes the opening without feeling redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is solid: sentences are clear, purposeful, and often carry dual weight (worldbuilding plus theme, or character plus setting). There is some conceptual repetition (“competing narratives,” “certainty”) and a few slightly redundant formulations, but not enough to stall momentum. Figurative language is restrained and coherent, and transitions between reflection and action are smooth. The prose is polished enough for serious consideration, though trimming a few explanatory sentences would sharpen its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are precise, metaphors generally coherent, and almost every sentence carries multiple functions (character, theme, and mood at once). There is no obvious scaffolding, synonym churn, or paraphrase looping, and the prose’s music supports the story’s concerns without veering into purple excess. A few figurative clusters lean dense, but they remain intelligible and don’t blur causality or emotional clarity. The closing image of the trembling note and the rosette’s “patient language” is particularly well-shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is strong line by line, with high information density and minimal scaffolding; most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). Figurative language (“iron bones bleeding orange,” “light poured…like liquid knowledge”) is vivid and largely coherent, not mixed or overstacked. Rhythm varies well across paragraphs, and there’s little paraphrase looping or filler. The elevated style approaches purple in a few spots but doesn’t significantly impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and dense with purposeful imagery (“light turned thick as honey,” “walls that remembered a thousand storms”) without slipping into muddled purple. Sentences generally do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character—so momentum holds despite the lyricism. Metaphoric fields (honey/nectar/light/memory) are coherent rather than mixed, and there’s little redundancy or scaffold. It’s polished line work suitable for high-level venues, though not yet singular enough to be unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm and structure, images are generally clean, and most lines do at least two jobs (advancing scene and theme together). Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined and pattern-coherent (breath, hush, scent, light), with few mixed metaphors. There is a slight tendency toward over-articulation of insight in a couple of sentences, but it doesn’t significantly bog momentum or blur clarity. No obvious scaffolding, loops, or technical errors interfere with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and largely free of scaffolding or repetition; images like “foxglove-stained glass ampoule” and “stone skin that remembered warmth” are vivid without becoming overwrought. Explanatory sentences do double duty, often carrying both worldbuilding and emotional charge. The main weakness is a slight increase in abstract, conceptual language in the final two paragraphs, which softens immediacy compared to the stronger concrete images earlier. Still, clarity, momentum, and information density remain high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, dense, and purposeful, with metaphors (“light…like the universe clearing its throat,” “preserved in amber mathematics”) that mostly land cleanly and enrich rather than obscure. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to feel purple, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Pacing flexes appropriately, with longer reflective sentences around grief and tighter lines during the crack’s opening. A few abstractions could be trimmed, but they don’t materially drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are often fresh (“filtered moonlight that dripped through condensation-streaked panes,” “smog outside pressed against the glass like a living thing”) and most lines do more than one job—advancing mood, character, and world simultaneously. There is a mild tendency toward rich figurative language in many sentences, flirting with lushness but generally avoiding muddle or redundancy. Pacing remains clean; there’s little scaffolding or synonym-churn, and the closure image is clear. Some tightening of overtly explanatory lines could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, image-dense, and generally free of scaffolding or repetition; almost every sentence does double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors (“the waterfall's roar had become a kind of silence,” “thawing like the spring ice”) are coherent and grounded rather than florid. Momentum is maintained despite reflective content because exposition is tightly bound to concrete actions (teaching, baking, examining manuscripts). A few thematic sentences could be slightly pared for maximum impact, but they don’t notably drag or obscure the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are mostly precise, and there’s good information density without much scaffolding. A few phrases flirt with purple (“ocean holding its breath,” “latent radiance”) but they cohere tonally and don’t clog momentum. There’s minimal repetition or paraphrase looping, and syntax remains clear even during more abstract descriptions of time and causality. The final paragraph in particular is clean and efficient, recharging earlier motifs (tide, emptiness, wrong-spinning lens) without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and purposeful, with high information density and few, if any, redundant lines. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and legible, enhancing mood without collapsing into true purple muddle, though a couple of stacked images edge toward excess. Sentence rhythm varies well with scene needs, and the final paragraph lands cleanly without explanatory overrun.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences have varied rhythm, clear syntax, and high information density, often doing atmospheric, thematic, and character work at once. Figurative language is frequent but generally disciplined, with the fractal/rough-draft/music motifs reinforcing rather than muddying the imagery. There are few, if any, obvious loops or scaffolding sentences; most lines earn their place. The only restraint on a higher score is a slight risk of over-saturation in metaphor that edges toward purple in a couple of places without actually breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, concise for its lyricism, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding; most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, character) while keeping momentum. Figurative language is vivid but not overstacked, and metaphors (sunlight as a beautiful lie, city protesting her departure) are coherent and apt. Syntax varies nicely, and the final lines land with clean rhythmic emphasis. There are no noticeable line-level artifacts or clarity issues that blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied syntax, clear sequencing, and multilayered lines that carry setting, character, and theme at once. Metaphors are mostly effective and coherent, with only occasional brushes against purple prose, and there’s little obvious scaffold or synonym-churn. A few lines paraphrase thematic ideas already implied by prior sentences, slightly reducing information density in the middle. The final paragraphs move with good rhythm and land on a clean, resonant image without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and musical, with varied sentence structures and generally high information density; almost every line advances setting, character, or theme. Occasional slight redundancies or over-lush phrases (“a hushed blaze that burned quietly,” some explicit thematic tags) are noticeable but do not seriously drag momentum. There are no major figurative muddles or artifacts that cloud the closure image, and transitions are clear and efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that carry both atmosphere and meaning (the kelp’s sideways glow revealing the seam, the stamp’s grooves worn by Celia’s hand). Prose mostly avoids redundancy and purple excess, though a few repeated formulations (“reclaimed stillness,” explicit thematic statements) could be trimmed or made more oblique. Momentum is appropriate for a contemplative piece; no major scaffolding or loop artifacts stand out. The final paragraph is clear and resonant without over-explaining, despite edging close to didactic summation.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, and most images do double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion or theme). Figurative language occasionally brushes purple but seldom confuses or clutters, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Key moments—the shadow’s capture, the lantern blazing through the gems, the basilica dimming—are rendered with clarity and momentum. A few abstractions (“luminous torment,” “mathematical desperation”) could be grounded in more specific sensation, but they do not materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are mostly precise, multi-functional, and avoid redundancy, and the prose maintains momentum despite reflection. A few metaphors flirt with purple (“intangibly tangible,” “world that had proven itself capable of casual annihilation”), but they stay coherent and on-theme. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony, and the final sentences land with clean emphasis. Overall, information density and rhythm are at a high, nearly publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are generally tight, clear, and purposeful, with good rhythm and no serious redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language (e.g., “sun bled its last copper light,” “brilliant dimness”) is vivid but not overstacked. Expository moments around the frequency concept stray close to abstraction yet remain intelligible. Line-level craft is strong enough for publication; a bit more compression in the explanatory sentences could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, and world) without bloat, and rhythm varies in a way that supports mood. Figurative language is selective and mostly clean; “sieved hush” is striking without being over-explained. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or mixed metaphors that drag momentum. A couple of lines verge on summary (“The tempered regret she felt was not absolution”) but remain within a disciplined, literary register.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with clear syntax, strong verb choices, and generally high information density; most sentences do more than one job (setting plus character or theme). Imagery (“furrowed hush,” wind carving grooves, mist erasing footprints) is vivid without sliding into purple excess, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping. A few lines lean into essayistic abstraction, especially around Mira’s crystallized motivation, but they remain legible and don’t stall momentum. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor tightening potential.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied rhythm, clean syntax, and high information density with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is mostly sharp and coherent, and description is tightly woven into action and thought. There are light paraphrase tendencies in recounting regrets, and a couple of slightly generic abstractions, but they don’t materially drag momentum or blur the closing image. Overall, the prose reads publication-ready with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is clean and economical, with strong images like the “cold blue light” echoing the operating theater and “phantom limb” of guilt doing multiple jobs at once. Sentences vary in length and structure, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding; most lines advance character, world, or theme. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and rhythm supports rather than fights the emotional arc. A couple of abstract phrases (“terrible numbness,” “jaded wonder”) are more telling than showing but don’t significantly blunt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but usually clear and coherent (“stars burn cold from a distance but could consume worlds up close”). There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loop, and grammar and sequencing are solid. The prose flirts with purple in a few spots but does not significantly blur sense or slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level writing is polished, with strong information density and minimal scaffolding; nearly every sentence advances mood, character, or premise. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and coherent, with no serious mixed metaphors or confusing images, though a few stacked phrases (“choking beauty,” “grief preserved in amber”) flirt with excess. Rhythm is varied and the prose reads smoothly aloud. For an elite venue, you might trim one or two ornamental metaphors to let the strongest images breathe, but the craft is already high.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most sentences advancing both worldbuilding and emotional stakes. Imagery around tears, crystals, weightlessness, and stitching is precise and mostly fresh, avoiding mixed metaphors. There is little redundancy or scaffolding; reflection is compact and tied to present action. A few lines lean on conceptual phrasing more than concrete image, but they don’t materially slow or blur the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is tight and image-rich, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without visible scaffolding. Metaphors are largely coherent and well-chosen, and there are no significant loops, filler, or rhythm artifacts bogging the piece down. The main check on a higher score is a mild tendency toward conceptual explicitness and occasional near-purple density, where one or two images could be trimmed without loss. Overall, though, the writing is publication-ready at an elite level in terms of clarity, rhythm, and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“shadows that had suddenly grown teeth,” “truth wrapped in shadow”) and efficient sentences that usually do two jobs at once. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythm supports the quiet-conspiracy mood without bogging down. Occasional abstract formulations and slightly over-shaped lines appear but don’t materially harm clarity or momentum. The final paragraph lands cleanly and recharges earlier motifs without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong, with vivid metaphors, varied syntax, and a good balance between lushness and clarity; the opening line in particular is arresting and precise. Most sentences do double duty—advancing worldbuilding and mood while moving the scene forward—without obvious paraphrase loops. There is some risk of purple prose in stacked metaphors, but they remain coherent and do not obscure causality or the closure image. Momentum is maintained through the explanatory beats, which is difficult in concept-heavy short work.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is strong, with high information density and images that generally pull double duty for mood and theme (“a sea of gray violence that occasionally flashed white” is a good example). Sentence rhythm varies well, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; metaphor density approaches the upper limit without tipping into muddle. A few abstractions (“controlled fury,” “furiously tranquil”) edge toward conceptual repetition, slightly dulling line-level surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is mostly tight, with strong sensory images (“ceremonial robes whispering,” “glass atrium trembled with morning light”) and good information density. There is some fondness for abstract pairings (“dignified chaos,” “elegant procrastination,” “elegant, violent disagreements”) that verge on purple but do not obscure meaning. Rhythm and syntax vary well, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or loop sentences. The main craft limitation is the summarizing of the duel, which mutes the line-level intensity at the story’s peak.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, specific nouns, and minimal filler; most sentences do double duty advancing character and atmosphere. Metaphors (“stars poured through the gaps like witnesses,” “fractured light through broken glass”) are apt and thematically aligned, with little clutter or contradiction. There is some density of figurative language, but it remains coherent and doesn’t bog momentum in such a quiet, reflective piece. I see virtually no scaffolding, redundancy, or grammatical slips; the prose would need only light copyediting for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, information-dense, and rhythmically varied, with minimal scaffold or repetition. Figurative language (e.g., “atmospheric currents that remembered the ocean,” “the horizon invited night”) is frequent but controlled and coherent, not muddled. Sentences consistently do double duty—advancing plot, character, and atmosphere at once—without clogging momentum. There are no obvious syntactic artifacts or loops that blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with vivid yet controlled imagery (“doubt glowed within her like phosphorescence, beautiful and uncertain”) and good information density—most sentences do multiple jobs. Figurative language is frequent but generally purposeful and not muddy; there are few, if any, mixed or strained metaphors. Redundancy is minimal, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum without calling attention to itself. The slight risk of ornamentation in phrases like “empirically whimsical” remains on the right side of clarity, but continued restraint would help ensure the style never feels self-conscious.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—images and sentences usually serve atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Metaphors (e.g., “drowning in everything unsaid,” “understanding diffuse through the pattern like light through water”) are apt and controlled, without stacking into purple excess. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or clunky filter-verb clusters, and the final sentences land cleanly. A very slight tendency toward uniformly elevated lyricism under all pressures keeps it from feeling utterly effortless.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is polished, rhythmically controlled, and high-density ("quieter flood of dementia," "tiny architecture of chitin"). Imagery is concrete and serves the story's logic. A slight deduction for the expository nature of the realization beat near the end, but line-level craft is otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("question mark etched into her chest"). There are minor moments of overwriting where metaphors become dense, but the momentum generally holds. The "algorithmic logic" phrase feels slightly jarring against the lyrical tone but serves the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    Repetitive sentence starts ([Name] [Verb]) flatten the rhythm ("Margaret positioned," "Margaret removed," "Margaret watched"). Additionally, the simile "like a held breath" is used verbatim in both the opening and closing paragraphs, creating an unpolished echo.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and high-density, with strong sensory detailing. Occasional metaphors lean toward the abstract ("geometry bent like grief"), but the rhythm and imagery generally support the tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, but it leans on adjective-noun pairings ("sharp angles," "careful quiet") and abstract assertions ("words both obvious and sacred") rather than concrete action. This creates a filter that distances the reader from the physical reality of the run.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is polished with a smooth rhythm, though it leans toward sentimental abstraction ("luminous residue," "pilgrim of sparks"). The prose is generally clear, but the reliance on "telling" the emotional mechanics dampens the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like "cathedral grown from roots and patience" and "doorways that opened onto moments." The line-level craft effectively conveys abstract concepts (retrocognition, hyperbolic geometry) through concrete sensory details without dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery and no mechanical errors. Information density is high, particularly in the opening description of the carnival. A few phrases lean toward purple ("dormant miracles," "chaos of keys"), but the line-level craft is generally strong and propels the story forward effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally exquisite with high information density ("cathedral of moss," "ribbons of singing green"). A slight repetitive reliance on the motif of "pressure" and "fathoms" (fathoms of water, fathoms of loss) across the latter half creates a minor echo. The phrase "the way all true things do" reads as a slight scaffold/generalization, but the overall craft is very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is fluid but often overwrought, relying on adjectival stacking ("fleeting golden sunset," "quietly savvy") and melodramatic metaphor ("press her ear against destiny's door"). While mechanically clean, the style prioritizes flowery description over muscular, active phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is generally functional but marred by significant clichés, most notably "audacity of hope," which breaks immersion, and "tomb of forgotten ambitions," which reads as purple. These artifacts detract from the otherwise competent rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally functional with some strong hooks ("Marla Chen didn't exist"). However, mixed metaphors like "confession spilling like rust" (rust does not spill) and melodramatic phrasing weaken the line-level authority.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.5)
    Rhythm is generally strong, but the proximity of "ambered hush" (para 5) and "marbled hush" (para 9) creates a distracting synonym loop. Phrases like "screaming gales" and "curious and cold" reduce freshness, preventing entry into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is high-density and polished, with evocative imagery ("transparent as memory") and strong rhythmic control. The writing avoids scaffold and clutter, though the required phrase "remarkably composed" appears twice in a way that feels slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    A significant mixed metaphor in the climax ("mistrust that had calcified... like ice, began to thaw") breaks physical logic; calcification does not thaw. Additionally, the "sky that had finally stopped weeping" is a cliché that detracts from the otherwise polished tone.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("gnarled roots themselves"). However, phrases like "endings and beginnings both" read as stock fillers, slightly lowering the density score.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally polished, but the forced repetition of oxymoronic phrases ("mechanically warm," "icy warmth") to satisfy prompt requirements creates noticeable artifacts. These repetitions draw attention to the writing's construction rather than the scene's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose flow is smooth and polished, but density is lowered by familiar metaphors and summary-heavy transitions ("Lately inspired by insomnia"). The ending leans into "telling" the emotional resonance rather than letting the image speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and dense, delivering high information with every line. The phrase "grief wearing celebration's clothes" leans slightly purple, but the overall rhythm supports the contemplative tension, and the final cadence is impeccable.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm and flow are generally solid, but the prose suffers from occasional purple artifacts ("frozen serpents," "confession waiting to spill") and stock phrasing ("settling into his bones") that distract from the otherwise stark reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high-quality imagery ("dripped constellations of moisture"). However, the reliance on past perfect constructions ("had spoken," "had learned," "had descended") to manage the summary mode creates a drag on momentum and distances the reader from the narrative present.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.8)
    While grammatically polished, the prose suffers from a severe repetitive loop regarding the "dreaming roots" (mentioned five times). Additionally, key phrases ("softly adaptive," "cautious exuberance") read as awkward prompt insertions rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is polished, with evocative imagery ("rust and moss and the particular bronze") and a pleasing rhythmic envelope structure. A few instances of filter/telling ("She was an odd historian," "Maren collected") slightly blunt the immediacy of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically assured, particularly in the "All outdated. All useless." sequence. There are no significant artifacts, though the density of "telling" in the reflective passages slows the momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and achieves high information density without clutter. There are moments of effective imagery ("silence so complete it felt like decoration"), though the text occasionally veers into slightly purple territory ("cathedral of logic") that calls attention to the writing over the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically assured, with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. Images like "exhaustion... settling into bones like snow" and "echoes of echoes" land with precision. The writing supports the story's ethereal tone while maintaining clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentences are polished, but the prose relies heavily on abstract nouns ("causality," "possibility," "definition") and filter verbs ("recognized," "understood"). The required phrase "darkening brightness" is repeated to the point of redundancy, weakening the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but reliant on standard adjectival metaphors ("whispered secrets," "frozen places," "painful and glorious"). While technically clean, the writing lacks rhythmic variation and occasionally drifts into melodrama. The imagery is functional but often familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high density and evocative imagery ("impossibility shifted beneath her like loose earth"). Line-level craft is strong, avoiding loops. The integration of required phrases ("credibly curious," "progressing laterally") creates minor friction, feeling slightly inserted rather than organic to the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from lexical repetition (using "crystal/crystalline" five times in a short space) and relies on clichés during the climax ("hit her like a wave," "tears came, and she did not fight them"). These artifacts dull the impact of the pivotal sensory moment.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract noun phrases ("gentle rewriting," "impossible sweetness," "terrible clarity") that distance the reader from immediate experience. Key descriptors like "impossible" are repeated to force emotional weight, and personification ("rope whispered") leans into cliché. The rhythm is somewhat monotonous, with frequent sentence openers following a similar subject-verb pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm. However, key descriptors ("chronic hush," "unfinished," "interrupted") are repeated to the point of bludgeoning the theme. The phrase "because she was acoustically perceptive in ways others were not" is a weak tell that explains rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is high-quality, with strong density and evocative imagery ("dying light like honey"). A few phrases border on purple ("golden resistance"), but the rhythm and syntax generally support the story's gravity effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but tends toward overwriting ("sharp as barnacle-scraped steel," "whimsically attentive to similarity but blind to crucial difference"). Emotions are often reported ("crumpled with emotion," "weep openly") rather than shown through specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.5)
    Imagery is often striking ("crumbled into frequencies"), but the prose suffers from frequent filter verbs ("Veren noticed," "Veren understood," "Veren realized") that dull immediacy. Some phrases lean toward the abstract or sentimental ("boldly sympathetic," "luminescent with ache"), reducing the physical solidity of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rhythmically sound and clear ("echoes were born rather than merely reflected"), maintaining momentum. However, imagery such as "silver threads" and "world held its breath" leans on familiar tropes, preventing entrance into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but suffers from high metaphor density that occasionally drifts into abstraction ("half-life of hope," "volume of silence"). Some phrases feel like prompt insertions rather than organic descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("held its breath," "stopped her heart," "spilled ink") and telling ("understood that this was her purpose"). Adverb-adjective clusters and abstract nouns dilute the immediacy of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "roots seeking water" and "silver into something finer." The phrase "circuitously sincere" is integrated smoothly into the narrative flow. Sentence variety effectively controls the pacing, slowing down appropriately during the moment of metamorphosis.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.8)
    While there are flashes of strong imagery ("spine emerging from grey flesh"), the prose suffers significantly from the repetitive looping of specific phrases ("haggard awe" x2, "wryly earnest" x2, "thresh meaning" x3). These act as text artifacts that break immersion and suggest a checklist approach rather than organic description. The reliance on these labels instead of fresh description for key moments lowers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished and readable, with strong imagery. However, reliance on filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") and a few clichéd phrases ("heart stammering against her ribs") distance the reader during key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is competent but slowed by filter verbs ("She noticed," "She found") and relies on passive constructions that dull momentum. Phrase insertions like "reactively visionary quality" feel clunky and disrupt the rhythm, reading more like prompt-checking than natural description.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with a strong opening image. However, abstract phrasings ("fortress of unspoken truths," "invisible weight") and adjective stacks ("analytically artistic precision") occasionally clutter the line-level clarity and weaken the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished, but the phrase "quantum threads" creates a jarring register clash with the archaic/mystical tone. Several filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") distance the reader from the emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but marred by clichés ("folded like origami") and the clumsy phrasing of the prompt word "intrigue." Repetition of "prismatic" and abstract descriptions ("hushed thunder") dilute the visual impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose relies heavily on single-sentence paragraphs and a repetitive Subject-Verb structural cadence ("Maya stepped...", "She had spent...", "People trusted..."). This template cadence reduces density and disrupts flow, reading more like a list than a cohesive narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Polished and evocative, with strong sensory imagery ("pink snow," "brass instruments"). There is a slight tendency toward abstraction ("incandescent restraint," "defiance of season") and a repetition of the descriptor "battered" for the notepad, but the rhythm is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose has momentum but suffers from several clichés ("felt it in her bones," "swallowed grief") and strained metaphors ("bureaucratic acid"). Frequent filter verbs ("She heard," "She felt") create unnecessary distance between the reader and the sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("echoing against rust"). However, it occasionally tilts into the melodramatic ("whisper of closing pages") or oxymoronic ("gloomy cheerfulness") in ways that feel like inserted artifacts rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished with strong sensory imagery ("fractured rainbows," "hungry calculation"). Sentence rhythm is controlled, though the density of exposition in the middle section slows the momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory verbs ("bleeding upward," "daily drowning"). There are no significant artifacts or loops. A few moments of filter ("She thought about what it meant...") slightly distance the reader, but the descriptions of light and chemistry are vivid and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by clichés ("precision of a surgeon," "silver veins") and adverbial scaffolding ("Carefully, methodically"). The central repair mechanic—sensing heat from light refraction in water—strains physical credibility in a way that distracts from the line-level reality.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. Phrases like "ashamed of itself" and "burdened with wanting" do heavy lifting for atmosphere and character simultaneously. The line-level craft supports the story's gravity without becoming overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished but occasionally lapses into purple or melodramatic phrasing (e.g., "gleamed like frozen midnight," "tears tasted like relief"). These artifacts distract slightly from the otherwise solid density and momentum. The line-level craft supports the solemn tone but misses the highest tier of freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and strong imagery. The sentence-level craft supports the story's pacing, particularly in the "unsnarling" sequence. Minor issue: the "frozen starlight" simile leans slightly toward cliché, but overall the line-level work is precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with standout lines like "reputation like a birthstone no one wanted to wear." The integration of required phrases is mostly smooth, though the transition "Through the scuffs... he slipped inside" feels slightly syntactically forced to accommodate the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is generally polished, lexical repetition diminishes the impact; variations of "impossible" appear four times ("impossible garden," "impossible growth," "impossibly," "impossible garden"), and the phrase "winter-cracked fields" is repeated three times verbatim. These loops act as artifacts that flatten the texture of an otherwise rich description.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high image density ("thread spun from the hair," "phantom fishing boats"). The line-level craft supports the magical realism without slipping into purple prose or confusion, though the "orchid" simile feels slightly disjointed from the established biome.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished with a good rhythmic ear ("air tasted of soil and sweetness"), but suffers from adjectival clustering ("warmly curious wonder"). The use of abstract labels to define emotional states acts as a scaffold that tells the reader how to feel rather than evoking the sensation through action.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic but marred by repetitive phrasing (the required phrase "carefully inventive" appears twice as a scaffold). Some descriptions verge on purple ("epochs," "cathedral") without adding narrative density.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("scattered pearls," "copper coins"), maintaining momentum without becoming overwrought. The line-level craft supports the "embroidered" texture of the story effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.7)
    While polished, the prose suffers from a high density of simile loops ("like silver," "like morning fog," "like heat shimmer," "like breath," "like ice," "like a held breath"). This creates a formulaic cadence that distracts from the visual quality of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythmic control in the decryption sequence. A minor cliché ("like warm honey") and the slightly opaque phrasing of the final tonal element prevent a higher score, but the line-level craft remains polished and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is competent but occasionally purple ("gray tide," "skeletal monuments"), and the insertion of the required phrase "pensive mirth" feels forced, disrupting the rhythm. The reliance on abstract descriptors ("hollowed her spirit") weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and dense ("bloomed in frequencies," "dead pigments"). The phrasing "worked methodically playful" is a minor syntactic hiccup, but the overall rhythm and imagery are distinct and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery (insect conspirators), though it occasionally leans on clichés ("virus of hope"). Rhythm is smooth, though the "morning glories" simile feels a bit stock.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("insomnia had become her companion, then her medium"), though occasionally overwrought with abstract pairings ("ocean memory and calcium prayers"). "Photosynthesize that darkness" reads as a slightly clunky mixed metaphor in an otherwise smooth text.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and reliance on "purple" descriptors ("achingly simple," "indifferent waters"). Several artifact clusters appear, including double adverbs ("impossibly, beautifully") and adjective-heavy noun phrases ("delicate crystalline flowers," "wind chime bamboo tube") that slow the rhythm. The imagery, while pretty, often prioritizes decoration over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is polished, high-density, and propulsive, with no visible scaffolding or loops. Phrases like "grief had calcified into accusations" and "alchemy that occurs when truth finally finds voice" demonstrate strong command of imagery. The rhythm varies effectively to match the emotional beats, slowing down for the moment of confession.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery ("dappled resolve," "murder dressed as negligence"). Sentences flow with good variety and rhythm. There are no significant artifacts or scaffold phrasing; the writing is efficient and vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwritten similes ("bloomed in her chest like the first flower") and some clichés ("shed like dead skin"). These flourishes distract from the otherwise strong imagery of the dust and the stone.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density. Some metaphors lean toward the ornate ("tasted of forgotten harvests"), but the style is controlled and purposeful. The integration of technical weather codes into poetic prose is handled deftly.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished with good rhythm, though it occasionally leans into overwriting (“choreography written in living light”). The phrase “shadowseam wonder” is repeated as a tag, and “softly ingenious” is a weak modifier pair. The breath imagery (“breathed in, breathed out”) becomes slightly repetitive near the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished but leans toward the sentimental ("fractured rainbows," "prismatic ghosts") and relies on repetitive sentence structures in the finale ("Some paths... Some paths... And some paths") that feel like rhetorical scaffolding. The density of adjectives in the opening paragraphs slightly slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("applause scattered like startled birds"). It occasionally leans into overwriting or "purple" phrasing ("happen upon her consciousness like a gentle tide") that softens the impact of the physical details.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is lyrical but occasionally overwrought ("obsidian grace," "spilled mercury"). A significant logic artifact occurs with "moonstone cabochon dust speck"—a cabochon is a shaped stone, not a speck of dust—which disrupts the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    While mechanically clean, the prose suffers from telling over showing ("A pebble became philosophy...") and occasional oxymoronic padding ("unremarkable perfection"). Syntactic parallelism is overused in reflective beats, creating a slightly formulaic rhythm that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is high-density and rhythmic ("cracked porcelain box pressing against his chest"). Phrasing is sophisticated, though occasional moments like "hard softness" feel slightly self-conscious; overall, line-level craft is polished and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is functional but relies on familiar workshop tropes and oxymorons like "serene upheaval" that blur rather than sharpen the image. The density of metaphorical language ("pages in a book written in light") sometimes obstructs the scene's logic, prioritizing sound over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, but it suffers from clumsy integration of prompt phrases (e.g., the summary sentence "Through half-burned diaries... Mira pieced together a story"). The phrase "sensitively perceptive" appears as an adverb-adjective tell rather than being smoothed into the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is polished but leans into "purple" abstraction ("delicate membrane," "revolution of reflection") that obscures rather than reveals. Phrases like "dusky harmony" used as a color descriptor feel forced and imprecise.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and strong imagery ("roots tangled through ribcages"). A few phrases feel slightly ornamental ("bleeding across the horizon"), but the line-level craft is generally precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished with strong rhythmic control and evocative phrasing like "patient as geology." A few images falter, such as the tautological cliché "falling into blackness like light into a black hole," which distracts from the otherwise high quality of the line-level craft. Sentence variety and density are otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished but relies on some worn phrasing ("gossamer strands," "impossible geometry") and abstract nouns ("liminal moment"). The reliance on adjectives and metaphorical "telling" (dissolving secrets, lullaby of conformity) occasionally softens the impact of the physical action. The rhythm is good, but the density of flowery descriptors drags the momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is evocative and polished ("silence held the quality of meteor hush"). Rhythms match the pacing of the "hush" well. No significant artifacts or overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    While functional, the prose is hampered by stock similes ("parted like curtains," "river of fire") and abstract metaphors ("frozen melody") that reduce immediacy. The repetition of the required phrase "blushing stillness" feels forced rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is evocative and polished, with strong opening imagery ("memory refusing to settle"). The rhythm matches the deliberate pace of the ritual, and the description of the casting process is precise and metaphorical without being dense.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose flow is generally strong with good sensory density ("rust-choked," "distant lightning"). However, the literal insertion of prompt phrases as descriptors ("casting everything in blue-green ethereal grit," "precisely playful approach") reads as forced and disrupts the organic immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally smooth but marred by repetitive phrasing that reads as generative artifacting. The exact phrase "dusky harmony" is used in both the setup and the final sentence, and "uncloak/uncloaked" appears twice in close proximity. These repetitions dull the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong line-level craft with memorable imagery ("carried resentment like a second skeleton," "sound itself refused to exist"). The prose maintains a solid rhythm, though it occasionally relies on filtering ("watched him," "began to teach") to direct the reader's attention.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished and high-density, with rhythm that supports the pacing; the description of the fog as "the breath of boundaries dissolving" is particularly effective. There are no significant loops or scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("color of fog," "green snow"). However, the text relies on some adjectival telling ("endearingly feisty") and the dialogue often feels like scaffolding rather than organic speech.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with effective bookending of the "brightened disquiet" phrase. However, the text relies on abstract descriptions ("memories crystallized") and occasional clichés ("time was a river") that reduce density. The explanatory passages regarding the time mechanics drag the momentum in the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery, though it occasionally leans on stock literary phrases ("smelling of ozone and regret"). Rhythm and syntax are competent, supporting the dreamlike quality of the narrative without major stumbling blocks.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from a density of abstract noun phrases and therapy-speak ("unreliable narrators," "narrative threads") that feels meta-discursive rather than immersive. Repetitive filtering ("Maya understood," "she realized") and forced oxymorons ("blissfully aberrant") clutter the line-level execution and stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but functional, relying on filter verbs ("realized," "understood") that flatten immediacy. The prompt phrase "warmly and methodically" is used repetitively as a descriptor rather than being demonstrated through distinct actions.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally high-caliber with strong sensory density ("notes that made her teeth ache"). However, the repetition of the specific phrase "gently luminous" (once for the sphere, once for warmth) within a short span reads as a prompt-force artifact rather than organic description. This slight redundancy prevents a higher score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative ("sangs its eternal chord"), with good rhythm. However, some phrases feel overwritten or clunky ("retrocognitively blessed" disrupts the flow), and the emotional beats occasionally rely on telling ("torment," "blessed") rather than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    Imagery is often striking, but the prose suffers from noticeable repetition ("deepening hush" appears in two key spots; "solid fog" repeats). The use of the famous phrase "terrible beauty" reads as an unearned cliché/echo of Yeats. Some adverbs ("preemptively," "naturally") clutter the rhythm where stronger verbs would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose has strong moments ("tiny mouths gasping"), but leans on abstract phrasing ("gravity of hopelessness") and cliché ("shattered into cascading gold") during high-intensity beats. These artifacts distance the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though it occasionally leans into literary clichés (e.g., "silence heavier than the stone itself," "impossible suspension of time"). The integration of the prompt phrase "warmly observant" results in a slightly awkward adjectival cluster, but overall density and flow are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flow is generally strong, but the repetitive sentence structure for describing silences creates a noticeable artifact. The phrase "stretching contracted" is grammatically awkward and disrupts the rhythm of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and lyrical, with good rhythm ("Song," "Gift," "Method"). Some imagery borders on purple ("dust made of light," "silence... like a living thing"), but the technical descriptions of the acoustics balance the softer metaphors well.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is functional and clear but relies on some stock descriptions ("impossible colors," "gleamed like scattered data points") and clichés ("sallied forth"). The repetition of distinctive words like "kaleidoscopic" within a short space reduces the freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally polished but occasionally slips into purple abstractions ("permeable as grief," "ritual of loaded emptiness") that distance the reader. While the imagery of the sanctuary is strong, these abstract metaphors dilute the physical immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and evocative imagery ("shame into something useful," "oxidized to a deep green"). However, the climax relies on a list of abstract concepts becoming physical ("fear manifested as black ice") which tells rather than shows the immediate threat. The rhythm is solid, though a few moments lean slightly into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is polished but overwrought, relying on clichés ("pooled like honey," "yawn of evening") and dense adjectival stacking. The repetition of "understood/understanding" in the climax dulls the precision of the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose maintains good density and rhythm, though it occasionally drifts into purple phrasing ("deserts that sang"). Line-level momentum is solid, though the repetition of "shivering bliss" feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is competent but relies on worn literary phrasing, such as "read them like scripture" and "unfurl in her chest" (a cliché somatic metaphor for emotion). While there are moments of clarity ("dirt still under his nails"), the reliance on abstract summaries of feeling ("abandoned twice over... by memory itself") creates a barrier to immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is mechanically sound but leans on clichés ("firebrands and ideologues," "palatable fictions") and assertive telling. The imagery occasionally drifts into purple territory ("reeds that whispered secrets") without earning the metaphor through tone.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is rhythmically sound and polished, with clear sentence-level propulsion. It is held back by a density of adjectives and filter verbs ("She felt," "seemed to") that dampen immediacy, and the use of "impossible spectrum" is a weak descriptor that obscures rather than illuminates the visual.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished, though the phrase "moonstone cabochon dust speck" creates a significant rhythmic stumble. There is a tendency toward "telling" thematic conclusions in the final third, which reduces the density of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished and readable. However, the integration of the required phrase "uncertainly certain" results in a grammatical stumble ("approached uncertainly certain of what she'd find"), and there is a tendency toward telling over showing in key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is readable but purple ("captured tears," "patient percussion") and relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings that slow momentum; "rain-washed" is repeated.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and flows well, with strong image density in lines like "opaque as river fog." However, the reliance on abstract descriptors for emotion ("genuine delight," "unexpected joy") occasionally dilutes the impact of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("seismograph of suffering"). A few moments rely on explanatory telling ("The forest was a living computer") rather than dramatization, but the overall line-level craft supports the story's intensity well.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.3)
    While the prose is competent, it relies on stock imagery and clichés like "colors that had no names," "thread fine as spider silk," and "eternal instant." These descriptors flatten the climax, replacing specific, fresh observation with generic fantasy rhetoric that dulls the visual impact.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished and readable with good rhythm. However, there is a reliance on telling over showing in key emotional beats ("She'd learned long ago that the boundary... was thinner"). Some phrasing leans toward cliché ("voice like wind through paper"), but technical descriptions are sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though occasionally leans into abstraction ("moved like longing," "clouds that remembered nothing") where concrete imagery would be sharper. The description of the shattering and the "crystal chimes" is sonically strong, anchoring the climax effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is fluid but relies on several stock phrases ("ink-stained fingers," "forgotten jewel," "heart that spoke") that dilute the freshness of the imagery. The inclusion of the rhyming poems creates a jarring tonal drop in quality compared to the descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally polished and rhythmic ("frequencies older than memory"). However, a few moments dip into cliché ("bloomed like a flower opening to dawn") or overly convenient similes ("turning them like music box cylinders") that feel like conscious writing rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished but relies heavily on filter verbs in key moments ("She saw," "She felt," "She realized"), distancing the reader. Some descriptions drift into purple territory ("if letters could breathe and pulse") without paying off the density.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies on a scaffold of frequent similes ("like a forgotten doorway," "like a turbine's hum," "like messages") that dilutes immediacy. Metaphors are occasionally mixed (nature versus machine imagery) without a clear thematic payoff for the collision.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is rhythmically competent but suffers from adjectival clutter and abstract phrasing ("hidden architecture of love"). There are no major mechanical errors, but the reliance on "to be" verbs and summary statements reduces momentum. The "weep without understanding why" line is a cliché that asserts unearned emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is dense and descriptive, but relies heavily on "telling" summaries ("Celeste understood why," "Celeste's motivation burned clear") to advance the plot. These shortcuts dilute the immediacy of the scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished, with strong opening imagery ("silent as a held breath"). The writing occasionally drifts into abstraction ("crystallized intention," "paradox of glass") during pivotal moments where concrete action would have carried more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is competent with high density, though it occasionally veers into purple territory ("velvet disquiet"). The reliance on "telling" the epiphany ("Accidental prophecy. The phrase crystallized...") weakens the impact of the realization. The flashback transition is a significant line-level artifact that mars the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished but tends toward overwriting, with phrases like "brittle as autumn leaves" lacking freshness. The integration of required phrases feels mechanical, disrupting the sentence rhythm and contributing to a density that sometimes obscures rather than reveals.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally polished with some striking images ("storms came to die"), but suffers from minor repetitive phrasing ("accumulated silence," "accumulated grief") and abstract adverb-adjective pairings ("credibly curious"). The reliance on filter verbs and interpretive labeling in the climax ("resonant without violence") softens the impact of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentence rhythm is controlled, but the prose relies heavily on abstract nouns and "telling" summaries ("flourishing stillness," "ancient loneliness"). These abstractions flatten the texture, converting potential sensory experience into conceptual statements.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose has momentum but suffers from stock metaphors ("understanding blooming like a flower in dry soil," "ocean of regret") that flatten the imagery. The writing is polished but relies on familiar combinations rather than fresh, sensory-specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and atmospherically dense ("gossamer-thin," "sediment layers"), supporting the ethereal tone without sacrificing clarity. The imagery is specific and evocative, and the text is free of distracting artifacts or repetitive sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished but relies on some clichés ("without ceremony," "polished glass") and abstract telling ("harmonizing discord"). The line-level craft is competent but lacks the freshness required for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with good density ("living stone pillars rose like petrified giants"). Occasional lapses into sentimentality ("perfect for human hearts") slightly undermine the clinical precision established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("finger pointing toward questions," "seeds thrown by a careless gardener"). However, filter verbs ("Mira understood," "She thought about") clutter the internal turning points, and the insertion of prompt phrases near the end feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("syllables that sounded like wind through broken windows"), driving the atmospheric pressure. The score is held back slightly by the opening cliché ("light bled from the sky"), but the subsequent imagery creates a distinct and memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally evocative, rhythmic, and dense with imagery. The integration of the required phrase "intuitively descriptive" is syntactically clunky, disrupting the otherwise smooth flow of the description.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished, but marred by repetitive phrasing (the phrase "echoed silence" appears three times verbatim) and some clunky metaphors ("vacuum-adjacent silence," "temporal-patient fingers"). The rhythm is steady, but the mixed metaphors regarding the texture of time ("spider silk," "taffy," "honey") clutter the imagery rather than clarifying it.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally polished with some strong images, but suffers from oxymoronic adjectival stacking ("cautious abandon," "sacredly playful reverence") that weakens clarity. These constructions abstract the action rather than making it concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with sensory detail. While required phrases like "nomadic penumbra" are slightly elevated, they are woven in with sufficient skill to avoid disrupting the flow, and line-level propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density. Some descriptors lean slightly toward the abstract or cliché ("impossible softness," "hidden thunder"), but the overall texture is high-quality. The sentence-level propulsion supports the climbing motif well.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, though a few phrasings lean toward the melodramatic ("unforgivable move," "weapon he had crafted"). The description of the emotional release ("something unknotted in Marcus's chest") is a cliché that dulls the impact of the otherwise sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("towers of bone rose like accusations"). The density of information is good, though the reliance on "like" similes ("like distant thunder," "like prayers") occasionally leans on familiar phrasings. The "distant thunder" comparison is a minor cliché that holds the score back from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose has strong rhythm and imagery, but suffers from frequent adjectival stacking ("dire enchantment, terrible and beautiful") and some clichés ("hungry fingers," "rivers on a map"). The writing is polished but tends toward the flowery, reducing the immediacy of the danger.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and no obvious artifacts. Phrasing like "colors now faded but still warm enough to hurt" demonstrates strong command of line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("paint the exact color of exhaustion"), maintaining strong momentum. Line-level craft is high, avoiding scaffold and loops, though the phrase "screaming tenderness" leans heavily into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished with good rhythm, though the repetition of "geography of [loss/grief]" acts as a minor conceptual loop. Information density is high, but the use of abstract noun phrases occasionally blunts the impact of the concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. Phrases like "honest language of mycelia" are excellent. However, a few metaphors lean toward the familiar ("excavation of the soul," "secrets spill like water"), which holds the score back from the top tier of stylistic innovation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is high-density and polished, with strong rhythmic control. The opening paragraph leans slightly into adjectival stacking ("opal," "iridescent," "bruised"), but the writing quickly settles into precise, evocative imagery that advances the plot without drag.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with efficient information density ("silence pressing against her like water"). While functional and smooth, some imagery leans toward standard phrasings rather than unique, character-specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level mechanics are generally competent, but simile density is distracting (six distinct similes in a short space). There is also a syntactic stumble in the climax ("a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies"), where the participle phrase dangles, attributing the agency of "spotting" to the "exhale" rather than the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished, though occasionally overwritten (e.g., "palette of resolve reforming with new colors" is a mixed/clunky metaphor). Rhythm and clarity are generally strong, maintaining momentum through the dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Imagery is strong ("patient as stone"), but filter verbs ("she felt," "she thought") and explicit emotion labeling ("Jealousy") dilute the line-level impact. The prose flows well but explains the emotional significance rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.1)
    Technical descriptions are sharp, but the prose is marred by cliché metaphors ("cracked like thin ice," "eyes carried storms") and pathetic fallacy ("city's slow tears"). These "writerly" artifacts weaken the line-level authority expected in a literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is evocative and dense with high momentum ("spilled ink," "glittering sheets"). While a few phrases border on ornamental ("churned with the memory"), the overall execution is precise, rhythmic, and free of scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.8)
    A significant subject-verb agreement error in pivotal dialogue ("You always advises") disrupts immersion. The prose suffers from abstract, purple metaphors ("pools of unfinished business") that reduce clarity and emotional impact. Mechanical competence is otherwise acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but relies heavily on abstractions and occasional clichés ("soft as moth wings"). There is a tendency toward telling over showing ("Disputes... all resolved"), and the density of high-concept descriptors sometimes obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, maintaining a high density of image and information without unnecessary scaffolding. Phrasing is generally evocative ("silence held weight"), though the description of the abstract visual phenomena occasionally relies on familiar descriptors like "crystalline light."

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with a strong sense of flow. However, it relies on several speculative fiction commonplaces ("equations she couldn't parse," "defied understanding," "captured starlight") that prevent the line-level craft from feeling entirely singular. The writing is effective and professional but lacks the unexpected spark of a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and dense, but the repetition of "melancholy" to define the tone and phrases like "rain's persistent music" feel slightly stock. No major loops, but the reliance on abstract descriptors in peak moments mutes the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery ("dial that clicked like teeth"). Occasionally, the phrasing leans toward the ornamental ("intersection of severed connections"), but the line-level craft is generally high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, fitting the "haunted euphoria" tone, but relies too often on abstract summaries of emotion ("she remembered," "she understood") rather than concrete embodiment. There is a tendency to "tell" the significance of moments rather than allowing the imagery to carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    While imagery is strong, the prose relies too heavily on -ly adverbs (precisely, technically, desperately, improbably, quietly, remarkably) to direct the reader. The repetition of "improbable/improbably" within a short span is a minor artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished but occasionally leans on "purple" abstractions ("architecture of grief," "topology of longing") that feel like literary stock phrases. These dilute the otherwise concrete, tactile immediacy of the forest scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. Phrases like "thresh meaning from experience" are excellent. The only minor flaw is the repetition of the "confidently uncertain" phrase, which feels slightly mechanical in its re-insertion at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is fluid and image-rich, but suffers from "telling" emotional states directly ("joy at finally being witnessed") instead of showing them. While free of mechanical errors, the reliance on abstract noun phrases to carry emotional weight reduces the visceral impact of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is frequently overwritten and leans on mixed or strained metaphors ("grief so tender it could have melted stone"). "Volcanic tenderness" appears as a forced phrase, and the text suffers from redundant phrasing ("ash and cinders") that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally fluid and evocative, with high density. However, it relies on some stock phrasings ("terrible, beautiful," "soul from calcifying") and purple abstractions ("hush of the universe inhaling") that dilute the sharpness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and evocative, particularly in the descriptions of the aurora and the maze's acoustics. The rhythm is controlled, and imagery is specific ("rust spot," "metronomic precision") without falling into purple prose or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by the repetition of the awkward prompt phrase "spiralingly calm" (used twice). This specific repetition acts as a text artifact that breaks immersion and lowers the score significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose has a smooth rhythm but relies too heavily on simile constructions ("like a bruise," "like curious ghosts," "like walls," "like a compass," "like a fragile queen"), creating a repetitive syntactic pattern. Some imagery strains for poetic effect ("bruise on the evening") without adding clarity. The repetition of "amplified quiet" dilutes its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is rhythmic and evocative, with high information density. The required phrase "combative tenderness" is woven seamlessly into the emotional climax, avoiding the feel of a checklist insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the imagery is solid, the prose relies too heavily on expository scaffolding ("This was the only way she remembered," "This was how she cultivated lightness"). This telling reduces the density and literary impact of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, effectively using polysyndeton ("Sound became vibration became light") to build tempo. While the imagery is occasionally purple ("gilding the frost patterns into scripture"), the line-level craft remains competent and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is rhythmically distinct and dense with functional imagery ("ash and amber," "weight of a small ghost"). There is zero scaffold or synonym churn; every sentence advances the atmosphere or the action.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with some striking imagery ("fractured into harmonics"). However, the reliance on filter verbs ("felt," "understood") and abstract assertions about the character's internal state prevents higher density and immediacy in the pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished with strong imagery ("chrysanthemum unfurling"), but momentum is dragged down by abstract phrasing ("suspended like dust motes"). There is a tendency to "tell" internal states ("something about its design arrested her descent") rather than showing them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally polished and dense, with strong images like "digital ash" and the physical use of the tape. The final line ("whispered their secrets") leans into genre cliché, softening the otherwise sharp, analytical tone established by the "invisible architecture" metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from abstraction in key moments ("defied geometry," "random sequences") and some purple phrasing that distances the reader. The climax relies on summary ("time lost meaning") rather than concrete, beat-by-beat action, reducing the visceral impact of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm is generally smooth, but prompt insertions create visible seams; "softly deliberate" and "luminous regret" are both repeated verbatim, creating a distinct template/artifact feel. The repetition of "notice/noticer/noticing" (7 times) borders on excessive.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose rhythm is smooth and controlled, with high clarity. A few abstract phrasings ("essential truth," "pretense") and the diagnostic passage in the middle reduce the immediate impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and evocative ("frozen in its descent like a displaced miracle"), with strong rhythm and density. The line-level craft supports the tone well, avoiding clutter while conveying the weight of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is evocative ("seats folded shut like sleeping birds"), but occasionally veers into slightly purple abstraction or expositional telling ("Vera was spatially imaginative in ways that made her valuable"). The rhythm is smooth, but the density of adjectives sometimes slows momentum without adding necessary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes ("like smoke," "like shadows," "like birds in amber," "like a river") that creates a decorative rather than propulsive texture. Repetitive sentence structures ("She began," "She turned," "She knew") dampen the rhythm in the latter half.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, successfully establishing a dreamlike quality, though it leans on "scaffold" phrases that summarize intent ("Her motivation was simple"). There is a reliance on abstract nouns (probability, wave functions) that sometimes blurs the physical action, but the line-level craft is competent.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, with high information density in the descriptive passages. A few stock transitional phrases ("Without thinking," "For a moment, nothing happened") flatten the momentum at crucial beats where fresher syntax would heighten the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from an over-reliance on similes and "poetic" phrasing ("soft persistence of stars," "like a mother's hand," "like driftwood") that feels decorative rather than muscular. This stylistic layer creates a barrier to the raw emotion of the scene, prioritizing sound over clarity and force.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally polished, but marred by occasional over-writing and adjective clusters like "seraphically mundane" or "strange synesthetic way" that tell rather than show. The rhythm is strong, but these artifacts drag on the immediacy of the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and high-density, with strong imagery ("black liquid bloomed like smoke"). There are minor instances of overwriting (e.g., "air itself seem clumsy"), and the phrase "regally unpretentious" reads as a tell rather than a shown trait, but the overall line-level craft is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery ("rationing grief like provisions," "sediment builds into stone") that serves character and theme. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully to match the swaying station and Marina’s internal agitation. No scaffold or artifacts disrupt the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but relies on adjective-heavy phrasing ("beautiful terrible mess," "thunderous serenity") that blunts the imagery. Filter verbs ("She felt," "She saw") appear frequently in the epiphany sequence, distancing the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is clear and mechanically sound but functional, lacking rhythmic variation at the climax. Phrases like "ancient neural pathways" and "implanted destiny" read as expository scaffolding rather than organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is high-density and polished with strong sensory details ("henna still fresh," "gold crescents"). A few phrases lean into literary commonplaces ("patient wound," "categories of before and after"), slightly dimming the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished with strong, specific imagery ("books pressed spine-to-spine like passengers"). There is a tendency toward slightly purple abstraction ("memory of fire," "amber grief") that occasionally softens the immediate tension of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and readable, but relies too heavily on stock metaphors and clichés ("time stretched thin as spider silk," "frozen lightning," "honey-thick," "absorbed panic like a sponge"). These artifacts dilute the freshness of the otherwise solid writing.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is functional but marred by the awkward insertion of prompt phrases ("bravely conflicted," "dangerous liaison letter") that disrupt the flow. The opening image ("snow fell in sheets") is a cliché, and adverbs weaken key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong, but marred by a specific synonym loop around the "engraved quiet" element: "engraved... carved-out... etched" appears in a single sentence, creating a stalled scaffold artifact. This redundancy halts momentum at a crucial interaction beat.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("feral beauty of a lullaby sung through clenched teeth"). Sentence rhythm varies effectively to match the tension, and the final beat lands with clarity and emotional weight. No significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished but relies on several stock similes ("like a splinter," "like wallpaper chosen by a madman") that dampen the literary quality. The "correction fluid for the universe" metaphor is striking but slightly logically muddied by the red ink imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense with strong imagery ("smoke remembering flame"), and the rhythm supports the "hush" of the atmosphere. The score is held back slightly by filter verbs in the resolution ("She understood now," "she felt something release") and the explanatory nature of the ending lines.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery ("curled... like breath held too long"). There is a slight tendency toward overwriting (synesthetic metaphors like "lilac-soft" and "lilac unease" feel a bit repetitive), but the line-level craft generally supports the magical realist tone without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally competent but suffers from forced phrasing to accommodate prompt elements ("warm coldness," "arms of steel"). The phrase "retrocognitively trapped" is a dense, rhythmic stumble, and "world dissolved" is a familiar cliché that flattens the magic's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but the density of figurative language (e.g., "shoulders curved inward like parentheses around grief") occasionally feels overwrought, drawing attention to the author's hand rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is evocative and dense, with high-quality imagery like "breadcrumbs written in mica and memory" and "frozen thought." The rhythm varies effectively between the technical descriptions and the emotional beats, avoiding artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished and readable but suffers from abstract phrasing ("silence... like sediment," "fossilized joys") and filter verbs that distance the reader. High-concept descriptions often replace concrete action, slowing the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density, though it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("spin a prophecy into raw possibility") without concrete grounding. The sentence craft is solid, but the reliance on "telling" shortcuts for mental states caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and polished, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("silver tide," "oxygen tubes feeding him breath"). The line-level craft supports the somber tone without dragging. The only slip is the slightly definition-heavy insertion of the prompt phrase "prudently daring," which momentarily disrupts the otherwise organic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong imagery ("spindrift serenity," "mist like a memory returning"). A few phrases mandated by the prompt ("percolated through the ambient awareness") feel slightly clunky compared to the surrounding lyrical texture. Overall, the line-level craft supports the atmospheric intent well.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmical, though slightly dense with similes ("like gray ribbons," "like memory," "like water," "like honey"). The imagery is strong, but the reliance on "like" constructions becomes noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery, though it leans on filter verbs ("she understood," "she thought") and summary to convey significance. The explication of the grandfather's philosophy slows the momentum near the end, trading immediacy for abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished but marred by several clichés ("claws gentle as whispers," "tears she had forgotten how to cry") and generic intensifiers. The use of "atomically" constitutes a register break that disrupts the otherwise archaic/fantasy texture of the description.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("prayer made stone"). However, the reliance on filter verbs at pivotal moments ("She understood suddenly," "She could see") distances the reader slightly from the immediate sensory experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Momentum is strong, and the visceral description of the signal ("liquid of her eyes") lands well. The score is held back by a few clichés ("Frankenstein creation") and reliance on lists of abstract nouns ("Fear. Certainty.") to convey emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished and readable but marred by adjectival clutter and clichés ("impossibly preserved," "malicious intent," "dancing shadows"). While the rhythm is generally good, the reliance on abstract descriptors ("prudently adventurous," "deliberate care") sometimes dulls the immediacy of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with strong imagery ("rising like tombstones"). The repetition of "furrowed hush" functions well as a structural bookend, reinforcing the quarry's timeless silence.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clean but marred by clunky phrasing like "spongey dread" (likely a forced prompt element) and clichés like "weathered by skepticism." The rhythm is readable, but the reliance on "telling" reduces density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished but marred by distinct artifacts and echoes, specifically the "patient as stone" / "patient as mountains" simile loop and the repetition of "luminous disbelief." The verbatim insertion of the motivation phrase as an internal realization ("Her motivation crystallized... to sculpt possibility") reads as stiff and explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally high-quality with strong density. There are occasional lapses into abstract phrasing ("strange arithmetic of return") and a few filter verbs ("watched," "understood") in pivotal moments that distance the reader slightly from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.4)
    Functional prose is marred by clichés ("gray fingers of morning," "echoed through bones") and heavy-handed metaphor. The writing often tells rather than shows, particularly during the pivotal translation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, with strong sentence-level propulsion during the vine-growth sequence. However, the reliance on abstract noun clusters ("guilt, relief, terror, and strange peace") to convey complex emotion weakens the impact of the climax. The final image of the shadow stretching behind her is a clean, concrete anchor for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from abstract metaphors ("color of bruises and promises") and repeated label-speak ("anxious elation" appears twice, once in the climax). These artifacts distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by the repetition of &quot;fiercely gentle&quot; and some awkward phrasing like &quot;inlaying meaning everywhere,&quot; which feels like a forced insertion. The imagery occasionally drifts into purple territory (&quot;mineral memory&quot;).

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from abstract similes ("shadows pooled like old regrets") and occasional purple phrasing ("carved into absence"). These artifacts distance the reader slightly despite the high density of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally competent but suffers from some abstract overwriting ("promise that had forgotten how to break") and repetitive tagging ("kindly methodical"). Some imagery leans on familiar tropes ("current through copper"), slightly dulling the specific texture of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmical ("ocean floor littered with forgotten things"), supporting the serene tone. A few filter verbs ("Mira noticed," "She decided") distance the reader slightly from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is competent with high density, though it occasionally drifts into cliché ("beautiful and terrible"). The repetition of "fractured rainbows" effectively recharges the image at the end. The required phrase "heartbeat of a hesitation" is integrated grammatically but feels slightly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("cascaded like green water"). However, abstract phrasing in key moments and the use of anaphora in the resolution ("She would... She would... She would...") create a rhythmic scaffold that feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative ("captured fog," "bound in what felt like frozen tears"). A few similes land on the heavy side ("like champagne bubbles held beneath a cork"), bordering on overwriting, but the information density remains high. Rhythm and flow support the pacing well.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("wrapped in equations and silence"). The specific sensory details, like the coffee stains and the "mulberry ache," land with precision, avoiding the trap of ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished, with high density and good momentum. A few abstract descriptors (“liminal space,” “gossamer boundary”) weaken the otherwise concrete imagery, but the line-level craft is generally high-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished with some strong imagery ("translucent form flickering like candlelight"). Several instances of telling via adverb-adjective clusters ("kindly decisive," "practiced grace") and filter verbs ("she could see," "she felt") prevent the line-level craft from reaching the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally high-quality and dense, with strong imagery. However, the final reflective block ("This was her protected vulnerability...") acts as a summary artifact that stalls momentum, explaining the story's mechanics rather than letting the final image of the chimes carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("decades that now ran backward through his veins like a river"), fitting the "high fantasy" mode. However, several moments rely on telling ("She needed it desperately") or standard phrasings ("impossible geometries"), and the visual mismatch in the first paragraph (child vs. forty) is a stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant redundancy artifacts mar the prose, notably "layer upon patient layer... layered dust" (Para 1), "ancient reverence... historically reverent" (Para 2), and "patterns within patterns... patterns in a flock" (Para 6). Additionally, the prompt phrase "weathered resolve" is repeated verbatim in the final two paragraphs, creating a noticeable echo.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("light that never quite committed to brightness or shadow") that supports the tone. The rhythm is generally good, though the final paragraphs suffer from a shift into abstract telling. Information density is high, and the "mist walking" description ("thought without a thinker") is a standout moment of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally competent but suffers from repetitive descriptors; the word "impossible" appears four times ("impossible dry," "impossible angles," "impossible pigments," "impossible light"), acting as a placeholder for specific description. Phrases like "beautiful and terrible and true" lean on cliché, and the immediate definition of "meteor hush" feels expository.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is evocative but heavily reliant on passive constructions ("had been ambered," "was a cast lots decision maker") and expository scaffolding, especially in the opening paragraphs. While the imagery is strong, the filter verbs ("Mira felt," "she recognized") distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished but relies on familiar adjective-noun pairings ("impossible beauty," "ancient indifferent stars") and alliterative shortcuts ("grief and grace"). The writing is functional but lacks the high-density freshness required for the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("scattered into a thousand shards," "patient mathematics"), supporting the magical realism tone. While generally strong, it occasionally leans on familiar phrasings ("thick as honey," "trembling hands") that dampen the freshness of the unique imagery. The line-level craft is high but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished with good rhythm and imagery, effectively conveying the "hush" of the setting. There is a tendency toward slightly purple descriptors ("violet grip," "surrendered"), but the line-level craft is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished and error-free but relies heavily on adjectival description ("kaleidoscopic," "prismatic," "ancient") that slows momentum. The writing is competent but functional, lacking the rhythmic variety or density required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("static faded like breath"). The insertion of the required phrase "attentively inventive focus" creates a noticeable rhythmic stumble, but the line-level craft is otherwise competent.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    Competent flow is marred by a reliance on stock imagery and clichés ("sharp as broken glass," "constellation of freckles," "snake shedding skin"). The prose tells more than it shows, particularly in the diagnostic middle section, reducing emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally polished but marred by a few clichés ("pregnant with possibility," "spoke volumes") and some abstract overwriting ("electricity of aftermath"). These artifacts dilute the otherwise strong imagery of the seed and the brook.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("throat that had forgotten how to swallow"). There is a slight tendency toward purple phrasing ("smile that didn't look like a wound") and the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "mournfully eager" draws attention to itself as an artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally evocative with good rhythm ("water closing over a stone"). However, it occasionally relies on abstract phrasing ("interiorizing exteriors") that tells rather than shows the internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is competent with some striking imagery ("frozen bloom"), but relies on clichés like "hollowed chest" and "nothing and everything." The register shift in the realization beat weakens the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished and dense, with effective technical verbs grounding the fantasy elements. However, the presence of clichés like "space between heartbeats" and slightly strained personification ("mouth that had forgotten how to close") mars the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished with high image density ("flickered like old television signals"). A few moments of explanatory phrasing ("actually cry, not just mime the motion") slightly drag on the momentum, but the rhythm generally supports the surreal atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful, with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. Phrases like "realistically imaginary" and "memories alter their own foundations" do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and world logic efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with good information density ("boat anchor chain link, corroded and barnacle-scarred"). Some imagery borders on "literary SF" standard ("pulsed in greeting," "paint by numbers"), but the clarity and flow are high-quality throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished and readable, though it occasionally dips into cliché ("spilled milk," "soft as cloth"). The reliance on expository summary to explain the magic system and the protagonist's internal state slows momentum in what is already a low-action piece.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished with good rhythm, though it relies on some stock phrasing ("drowned cathedral," "gift and her curse") that dulls the otherwise sharp imagery. The "weak tea" description stands out as a fresh, specific sensory anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level mechanics are polished with a steady rhythm. The score is limited by a reliance on abstract nouns to convey emotion ("archived griefs," "fragments of identity") where concrete imagery would have been more forceful.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished with high information density. However, the phrase "living algorithms" creates a jarring register break against the established mythic/organic tone of bone towers and copper veins.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by a distinct tautology ("spiral upward in spiraling ribbons") and occasional reliance on filter verbs/telling ("She understood then," "terrified and exhilarated"). These artifacts slightly dull the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("silvered by decades," "resonantly soft"). The density is good. Minor artifacting appears in the list-like description of the music's emotional content, which reads a bit like a template cadence, but overall the line-level craft is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("lightning flickering like dying fireflies") and good sentence variety. Information density is high, avoiding scaffold or filler, though the "thunderstorm in a bottle" description leans slightly on genre tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.0)
    Significant repetitive artifacts damage the prose flow; the phrases "misting hush" and "quietly persistent" each appear three times in a short text, reading like forced prompt insertions rather than organic description. This mechanical repetition creates a "template cadence" that distracts from the imagery. The prose leans purple ("dust rising like incense") and relies on similes where direct action would be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is rhythmically strong and dense with specific imagery ("crystallized into a dodecahedron"). There are no significant artifacts or loops, though the reliance on abstract nouns in the climax ("truth," "infinity") slightly diffuses the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished but relies on repetitive abstract intensifiers ("impossible distances," "impossible colors," "impossible gold") to carry weight. The summary of Miriam's emotional release ("wept for an hour, then laughed") lacks the density required for a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from simile density ("like honey," "like a held breath," "like seeds," "like thorns") which clogs the rhythm. Phrasing like "enigmatic in the way that water is enigmatic" is tautological. The writing tells emotions through adjectives rather than showing them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong sensory details ("petrified white," "salt-and-rust smell"). Phrases like "void that pulled at her attention like a held breath" demonstrate high-quality craft. The rhythm flows well, supporting the emotional arc without falling into purple prose or unnecessary density.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like "trapping a shadow like amber preserves a wasp." The rhythm tracks the character's shift from anxious retreat to decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is mechanically competent but leans toward purple abstraction ("hush of budding hope," "marriage of every world's forgotten dreams"). Reliance on adjectival stacking and abstract nouns dilutes the imagery, telling the reader how to feel rather than evoking the sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.9)
    Imagery becomes repetitive, creating a scaffold effect: "fractured starlight" appears three times (paras 1, 4, 7), and "interlaced hush" repeats. The climax relies on abstract telling ("lucid unrest," "strange economy") rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose quality is high, with strong rhythm and evocative imagery like "patient as prayer" and "differences accumulated like evidence of a crime." Information density is excellent, and there are no significant scaffold artifacts or repetitive loops.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and readable, with distinct imagery ("transmuted into calcium deposits"). However, the density of metaphors is high, sometimes drawing attention to the writing itself rather than the scene. There are no significant technical errors or loops, but the "physics of letting go" refrain becomes repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and legible, with some strong imagery ("fragments of corrupted data"). However, adjectival phrasing ("driftingly alert awareness") and compound descriptors occasionally clutter the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but relies on sentimental clichés ("eyes that had forgotten how to hope," "tears forming," "spirit smiled") that dull the emotional impact. While the imagery of the ice and gears is sharp, the emotional beats drift into melodrama. Line-level momentum is steady, though the final paragraph creates a distancing summary effect.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a noticeable density of "like/as" similes (old griefs, dusty starlight, old skin, secret) in the first half. This repetitive syntactic pattern creates a cadence artifact that dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with strong sensory imagery, though it occasionally drifts into overwriting ("landscapes of texture"). The pacing is well-managed, accelerating appropriately as the demolition crew approaches.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("ink dissolving in water"), though it occasionally leans on stock phrasing ("constitutionally incapable"). Rhythm is generally good, but the climax is diluted by a shift into summary rather than immediate, concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the prose is generally polished, a significant repetition artifact disrupts the flow: the phrase "scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner" is repeated almost back-to-back. Additionally, some metaphors ("flooding through her like dawn") lean toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is competent but prone to "purple" descriptors ("living stardust," "heartbeat of their agricultural rhythm") that prioritize decoration over precision. There are no major mechanical errors, but the reliance on filter verbs ("Elara knew," "She saw") distances the reader from the immediacy of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative, with strong imagery ("amber and bruise"). However, the repetition of prompt phrases like "beautifully flawed" and the slightly awkward usage of "vouchsafe" create minor rhythmic artifacts that disrupt the otherwise smooth polish.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong sensory details like "copper warnings" and "ghostly light." The phrase "offhandedly exact precision" is slightly heavy, but overall the sentence-level craft propels the story efficiently. The descriptions of the mechanical birds are particularly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is competent but marred by significant clichés ("heart refused to accept," "loosens its grip," "ancient patterns"). Telling often replaces showing ("Elena had been symphonically minded"), and the reliance on platitudes flattens the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmic ("shifted like mercury mixed with pearl"), creating a strong textural experience. A few moments of adjective-stacking ("luminescence spread mindfully scattered") slightly clutter the line-level clarity, but the imagery remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and evocative ("stone walls weeping," "tasted petrichor... mixed with something older"). A few similes ("ink into water," "dam breaking") lean toward the conventional, preventing a higher score, but the sentence-level rhythm and density are otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally rhythmic and polished, fitting the musical subject matter. However, the integration of required terms ("empathetically decisive," "vigorous") results in adverb-heavy telling that momentarily disrupts the show-don't-tell flow.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished, but the repetition of the prompt phrase "chaotically precise" (three times) acts as a mechanical crutch. Some filter verbs ("Vera understood now") weaken the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though occasionally dense with adjective stacking ("clandestinely luminous," "fractured angles"). The line-level craft supports the magical realism well, but some thematic exposition slows the momentum in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished with good information density, but slips into cliché ("profound as prayer") and weak modification ("intensely quiet") at the climax. Some similes feel decorative rather than urgent, slightly slowing the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished but relies on some purple phrasing ("twilight painted the sky," "sentinels") and abstract somatic descriptions. The repetition of prompt phrases like "thoughtfully precise" and "correlating" creates a slight mechanical echo. The pacing is smooth but lacks sentence-level urgency during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from mixed metaphorical logic (mixing sound frequencies like 528Hz with light's "ultraviolet"). The writing leans on abstract nouns and "tell" summaries ("painting the air with colors only the heart could see").

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally functional, but suffers from register mismatches and "tell" artifacts. The verb "journalize" is awkward and disrupts the rhythm, and phrases like "cataloging the settlement's secrets" feel mechanical against the backdrop of an ancient, organic setting.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("she noticed," "she watched," "she realized") that distance the reader from the action. Repetitive descriptors like "impossible trees" and "impossible speed" dilute the specific density of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high-quality phrasings like "truth revealed itself in absence." A few metaphors (e.g., "vast, metal heart") lean slightly toward the conventional, but the density of thought and image remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmic, handling the dense imagery of light and sound well. A few phrases feel slightly ornamental ("prismed light"), but the line-level craft generally supports the ethereal atmosphere without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally evocative but hampered by filter verbs that distance the reader at critical moments ("she could see the shadow-realm," "Mira thought she felt," "She watched"). Some phrasings lean into abstraction ("insight burned itself," "failure lived in her bones") where concrete imagery would sharpen the impact. The rhythm is solid, but these small artifacts dull the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished but occasionally dips into purple phrasing ("impossible geometries," "gasped at the sudden mathematics"). The rhythm is generally strong, but the reliance on abstract metaphors ("loss multiplied by memory") sometimes obscures the emotional reality.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and descriptive, but the heavy load of expository reflection creates significant momentum drag. The sentence-level craft is high, yet the pacing suffers as the story halts to explain the past rather than advancing the present.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density ("spotted and warm," "unpolished stone"). There is a tendency toward metaphor density ("silence relocated," "mask of impossibility") that risks overwriting in the opening, but the imagery generally serves the story’s atmospheric needs without breaking flow.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mechanics are clean, but the prose suffers from metaphor density and some clichéd phrasing ("diamonds of light," "tapestry of time"). The forced insertion of the attribute "stoically sparkling" disrupts the rhythm and logic of the description.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative, with good rhythm. However, it relies occasionally on clichés ("wounds that weren't physical") and slightly purple phrasing ("shades of defiant blue") that soften the impact of the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.0)
    Some imagery works well, but phrasing is occasionally awkward or grammatically rough ("manifested cyclically spontaneous" should likely be "spontaneously"). There is a tendency toward abstract, slightly purple descriptions ("gravitational pull from the withheld").

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally overwritten ("luminescent weight," "silence that speaks"). These poetic turns sometimes border on cliché, though the density of specific imagery remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from adjective stuffing ("familiar anticipation," "captured essence," "shadowed elation") and melodramatic phrasing. There is a lack of line-level propulsion or density; the text relies on telling the reader how to feel ("strange joy," "full heart") rather than evoking it through concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, though it relies on some cliché phrasings ("deepest shame," "like a stone") and hyperbolic descriptions ("impossible color," "exploded into blue fire"). The imagery is dense but occasionally abstracts the action rather than grounding it.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is distinct and propulsive, with "quantified sorrow" standing out as a high-value conceptual phrasing. The rhythm supports the pacing well, though a few descriptions ("old starlight," "desperate fingers") lean slightly toward familiar imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose relies on stock metaphors ("insects in amber," "water through cupped fingers") and suffers from a repetitive "She [verb]" sentence structure that creates a monotonous drumbeat rhythm. While clear, the writing lacks the fresh textural density required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is smooth and readable with good rhythmic control ("stones surfacing in still water"). Minor repetitive artifacts (using "impossible" twice to describe the library; "crumpled invitation" twice) and a tendency toward abstract description slightly reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative ("swallowed the small wooden structure," "ghost of its original sweetness"). The insertion of the prompt phrase "heuristically gentle" creates a slight register clash with the poetic tone, requiring an immediate explanatory appositive that slows the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "lightning frozen in stone." However, a few moments lean into cliché or melodrama, such as "colors that had no names" and the instrument that "did not merely sing—it wept." These slight lapses in freshness prevent a higher score, though the overall technical execution is very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("lanterns swinging like captured stars"), maintaining strong momentum. The prompt phrase "curiously steadfast" is repeated as a tag rather than woven into the flow, but otherwise, the line-level craft is high-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally dense and sensory, but a significant artifact in the third paragraph ("The election happened every generation, while forests hold elections for which...") disrupts flow with awkward repetition and forced syntax. This creates a visible seam where a required element was pasted in, momentarily breaking the narrative spell.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is functional but marred by repetitive phrasing (the clunky "mnemonically gifted mind" appears twice) and abstract telling ("joy absorbed," "weight of silence"). The use of "uncorked" in the climax clashes with the established lyrical register.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative with strong sensory verbs and high information density ("gold leaf waited," "sulfurous sky"). The pacing is generally smooth, though the compression of the journey results in a slight loss of textural opportunity in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("calcified into ritual"). However, it occasionally relies on abstract metaphors ("symphony of truth," "finger pointing toward truths") that distance the reader from the concrete physical action of the tuning.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and no wasted motion. Lines like "Ordinary objects made sacred by terror" and "calcified into something immovable" do heavy lifting in characterizing the items and the emotion. The high information density ensures the story moves briskly despite the introspective focus.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is functional but marred by mixed or clichéd imagery; "stories accumulated like morning dew" creates a conflicting image (accumulation vs. evaporation), and "guilt like a dog on a leash" is murky. The didactic paragraph explaining the healing power of listening stalls the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose is polished, it suffers from "purple" tendencies and an over-reliance on similes ("deliberate as a spider," "like snow," "like a torch"). The shift to present tense for the explanation of her method is a mechanical error that stalls momentum. The writing often tells emotions ("aching port de bras") rather than evoking them.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally competent but falls into cliché at critical moments, such as "colors that had no names" and "vortex of captured time." While some images land well ("pressed flat as any flower"), the reliance on abstract descriptors in the climax dilutes the visual impact. The density of information is good, but the "tell" ratio increases significantly in the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, fitting the meditative mood. There is a slight reliance on filter verbs ("She felt," "She found") and some abstract phrasing ("geometry of controlled thought") that distances the reader slightly from the physical immediacy of the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density, successfully establishing the magical realism. It occasionally leans on standard similes ("like a secret language," "like a memoir"), but the "building as text" imagery is sustained well.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with good sentence variety. There is a tendency toward adjectival stacking ("tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve") and the aforementioned repetition of "velvet" detracts slightly from the otherwise clean execution.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished, using refrains effectively to build a sense of ritual. Occasional phrases like "ink the color of midnight" lean slightly toward convention, but the overall texture is high-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from abstract telling in key moments (e.g., "detect layered harmonies," "webs of intrigue"). The insertion of "progressive disclosure" reads as slightly academic and disrupts the established mythic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with adjective-heavy description ("amber and shadow," "sacred cold"). While the imagery is often effective, the density of figurative language sometimes slows momentum without adding necessary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose has good rhythm and density but suffers from some overwrought phrasing and adverb-heavy descriptors ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity"). These moments feel like forced insertions or "purple" writing that clutter the otherwise clean sensory imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is clean and readable, with distinct imagery ("spiral patterns in the flesh"). However, the text relies on familiar phrasings ("colors that existed nowhere in nature," "drinking deep") and repetitive conceptual tagging ("comfortable lie") that flattens the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and dense, though it occasionally drifts into "writerly" affectation (e.g., "bruised twilight," "cobbled together... from prayer"). The rhythm is controlled, but the metaphor density sometimes draws attention to the author rather than the image.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished but suffers from sentimental overwriting ("ache of beauty too large for his chest," "lonesome splendor"). While rhythmic, the reliance on poetic abstraction reduces immediacy and grit.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm and imagery ("mournful whales," "expanding sphere of pure sound"). The insertion of the prompt phrase "fleshly ethereal" feels slightly forced within the sentence structure. Some scaffold phrases ("Vera understood what she must do") could be trimmed for greater immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    The phrase "softly purposeful" is integrated awkwardly, creating a grammatical error ("worked softly purposeful"). While the rhythm is generally good, the prose relies on several clichés ("grief like a stone," "pale fire") that dull the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally competent but prone to abstraction and clunky modifiers ("watchfully calm precision"). The reliance on specific prompt phrases as literal text creates a scaffolded feel that interrupts the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mechanically clean, but prone to sentimental phrasing ("words... like stones in his chest," "melody like forgiveness finding its way home") that softens the literary impact. The phrase "aptly deliberate precision" is slightly clunky, using an abstract judgment adverb where concrete description would work better.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with strong verbs driving the imagery ("licked," "hissing"); the dialogue is sharp and character-specific, devoid of scaffold or unnecessary exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative, with strong imagery ("stars... burning like distant servers"). Occasional phrasing leans toward the melodramatic ("He had been walked away," "warning. Or a blessing"), but the rhythm and flow are effective.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is generally functional but prone to purple phrasing in descriptions. The phrase "map empathy onto action" creates a jarring register break, introducing clinical/academic language that clashes with the established mystical atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and evocative, though occasionally slips into heavy-handed telling ("Through disaster relief volunteering, she discovered..."). The phrase "windborne solace drifted eternal" leans toward purple, but the rhythm is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from register drift, mixing lyrical imagery ("slow arithmetic") with academic jargon ("intersubjective") in a way that jars. Figurative language is occasionally dense, bordering on purple.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is polished, with evocative phrasing like "catch lies in the flutter of eyelids" and "wisdom needed infrastructure." The neologism "whisperfield" lands well within the established voice. There are no significant prose artifacts or pacing drags, though some descriptions of the magic tilt slightly toward the abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    While mechanically competent, the prose suffers from "precious" metaphors ("corners chewed by time," "purple persistence") that summarize emotional states abstractly. These artifacts draw attention to the writing itself rather than the reality it seeks to depict.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.7)
    Polished and lyrical with good rhythm, though occasionally adjective-heavy ("towering shelves," "cramped observations"). The description of the crystal's function leans slightly on telling ("defied her understanding").

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong, with memorable imagery ("A horse became a woman became a wave"). There are minor instances of "telling" abstract emotions ("residue of certainty," "tidal longing") that could be more physically embodied, but the overall prose quality is high, with excellent rhythm and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery. However, the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("luminous ache," "changelessly constant") creates noticeable text loops that feel like checklist insertions rather than organic descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is fluid but heavily reliant on similes ("like honey," "like slow thoughts," "like honeysuckle") that crowd the short text. The phrasing tends toward the poetic ("hymning the mundane") at the expense of concrete immediacy, creating a filter between the reader and the action.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    A specific phrase repetition artifact ("Quietly deliberate" opens two separate paragraphs) disrupts the prose flow. While generally polished, the writing leans on some cliché metaphors ("flower remembering spring") and standard fantasy descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished ("shrewdly innocent," "puzzles of calcium"), but the climax and resolution suffer from clichés ("voice like silver bells") and purple phrasing ("turn sorrow into stars"). These artifacts slightly undermine the clinical precision established earlier, particularly in the high-stakes closing moments.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is rhythmically competent but suffers from abstract metaphors ("smooth as forgiveness") that blur sensory clarity. A recurring "action-then-reflection" cadence slows momentum, and the density of adjectives in the descriptive passages occasionally obstructs the visual immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. While "emerald velvet" leans slightly purple, the line-level craft largely supports the story's atmospheric weight without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is fluid and rhythmic with strong imagery. Some phrases border on overwrought ("compressed whispers," "mist breathed"), but the line-level craft is generally high quality and free of scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is functional but relies on familiar phrasings ("tears streamed," "pale ghost," "blood memory") that dull the emotional impact. The density of adjectives in the opening paragraphs slows momentum without adding necessary narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished but relies too heavily on simile constructions, particularly at the climax ("like a prayer," "like cupped palms," "like scattered seeds," "like life," "like released spirits"). This density of figurative language filters the immediate action through comparisons, distancing the reader from the raw sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished and dense, but marred by the repetition of the "wounded" motif (paragraphs 1, 7, and 12) and some filter verbs ("She felt wonder bloom") that distance the reader from the visceral experience of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished with high information density and strong sensory imagery ("mineral sweat," "earth remembered"). Occasional abstract phrasings ("nowhere within herself") slightly dilute the otherwise grounded texture.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with good rhythm ("slow climb toward singing"), though it occasionally leans into "writerly" phrasing ("soft percussion," "painted the city"). The repetition of key motifs ("here and gone," "crystallized") borders on heavy-handed but generally serves the accumulative structure well. No major artifacts or stumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric with high information density ("serrated edge worn smooth," "chemical ghosts"). The rhythm is controlled, though some dialogue leans slightly toward aphorism, which creates a minor feeling of artificiality in the speech patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mechanically competent, but marred by abstract phrasing ("calculating the next equation in the series that might lead humanity back") and the forced insertion of prompt phrases ("functionally creative"). The prose tends to summarize the significance of actions rather than letting the actions speak.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.8)
    Competent prose is marred by stock metaphors ("oil on water") and awkward phrasing in the second use of the prompt attribute ("tears... gentle progress"). Repetitive diction ("glacial" used three times) flattens the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.0)
    Rhythm is generally smooth, but the prose suffers from stock phrasing ("hollow as promises") and abstract oxymorons ("serene upheaval") that tell rather than show. The letter constitutes a large block of expository dialogue disguised as a document.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished with a strong rhythmic flow, particularly in the descriptions of the harbor. However, the reliance on abstract phrasing in key moments ("chaos made permanent," "instructions for becoming something else") dilutes the impact of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("vividly descriptive," "geography of healing") which act as text artifacts. Additionally, phrases like "vividly descriptive truth" tell rather than show the quality of the writing, and "lonesome splendor" leans into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from abstract phrasing ("quaking reverie of genuine amazement") and some cliché ("trembling hands," "bitter symphony"). Dialogue tags occasionally summarize thought rather than letting the line stand alone.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes (over eight "like/as" constructions in a short space), creating a scaffolded, filtered experience. Phrases like "shook... as a man trying to hold water" and "shadows... like memories" dilute the physical immediacy of the scene with stock figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished and readable, but relies on familiar similes ("bloom like flowers after drought," "sigh finally released"). The integration of prompt phrases like "sidereal patience" feels slightly mechanical and told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.5)
    The opening sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error ("dimensions that approximates"), undermining confidence immediately. The prose relies on "sighing" personification and abstract noun-phrasing that reduces immediate sensory impact.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose suffers from several clichés ("tears frozen mid-fall," "distant thunder," "uninvited guest") that dull the imagery. While competent, the reliance on "like" constructions for description creates a repetitive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished with high density and strong imagery ("distorted woman made of angles and shadow"). However, some phrases veer into purple prose ("fractals of amber and blood," "searing reverie"), and the pacing drags during the thematic expositions. The rhythm is otherwise well-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.6)
    Distinct lexical echoes ("tenderly"/"tenderly", "velveteen"/"velveteen", "shape of intentions") within a short space mar the polish and suggest a lack of close editing. The prose density leans on metaphor stacks that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished with moments of striking imagery ("black tooth," "sharp as ambition"). The flow is generally good, though occasionally interrupted by abstract summaries or clunky phrasing like "groundedly imaginative" that feels inserted to satisfy a constraint rather than arising from the character's natural voice.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally competent and rhythmic, with strong lines like "architecture of music." However, it suffers from occasional purple phrasing ("thistled calm") and telling ("seemingly harmless") that distances the reader. The metaphor of dust is overworked, appearing in nearly every section.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high density and strong imagery ("corpse on paper"). A few phrases lean slightly toward the melodramatic ("tiny universe suspended in grief," "shadow that revealed more than light"), but the technical execution of the ritual scenes is sharp and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetitive phrasing ("abrasive calm" and "agonized" both appear twice; "narrative" appears five times) creates a looping effect. Abstract nouns and clunky constructions ("The rational part of his rebellion demanded") reduce line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("held autumn like a secret"), with high information density and no scaffold loops. A few metaphors border on heavy ("pressed... like accumulated grief"), but the overall line-level craft is polished and rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is competent but overwritten, relying on dense and sometimes clichéd metaphors ("broken promises," "liquid knowledge," "forgotten ribcage") that draw attention to the writing rather than the scene. The rhythm is functional, but the heavy figurative language slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjectival stacking ("slowly, beautifully") and cliché phrasings ("spilling from her like water through broken glass"). While the imagery is lush, the reliance on "telling" regarding the character's nature ("She preserved wonder in routine") dampens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. However, it suffers from occasional abstract metaphors ("pulse with a shard of hush") and clunky phrasing ("creeping normality noticer") that slightly disrupt the otherwise smooth flow.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished but relies on workshop clichés ("panic tasted like copper," "clutching certainty like a lifeline") that dull the impact. The "cascading revelations" paragraph resorts to summary to explain the core magic system rather than dramatizing the insight through action.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, but a significant proofreading error ("like a engine") disrupts the final paragraph. Additionally, the required phrase "balancedly daring" reads as clunky and adverb-heavy, momentarily jarring the rhythm of an otherwise polished section.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but reliant on standard noun-adjective pairings ("smog-choked," "ancient vents") and filter verbs ("Maya felt," "Maya saw"). The phrase "seemingly dipped in captured starlight" weakens the image with "seemingly," typifying a tendency toward soft hedges over concrete assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery throughout. The sentence craft supports the melancholic tone well. A few phrases border on cliché ("throat of oblivion") or excessive sentimentality ("thaw reach her chest"), but the line-level quality is generally high and the "museum voice" lines are pitch-perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is high-density and evocative ("tide pools holding the last breath"), though the prompt integration for "initiate" resulted in a slightly passive phrasing ("initiate his understanding"). Line-level control is otherwise strong, with no significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and atmospheric, though occasionally bogged down by heavy modification (e.g., "photographically cursed condition" feels clunky). The dialogue is generally effective, though specific word choices mandated by the prompt struggle slightly for naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally relies on "purple" phrasing or clichés ("sky bleed," "desperate fingers," "nightly sermon"). These ornamental descriptors sometimes crowd the imagery, reducing the stark power of the core concept.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with strong imagery ("bleached to bone white," "heavy and golden"). Information density is high, though minor reliance on filters and a few slightly standard phrases ("monument to decay") prevent the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmic ("green fire frozen in time"), though the exposition regarding the Institute's motives ("She understood noble lies...") relies slightly on summary. The line-level craft remains high-tension and precise, avoiding major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is competent but overwrought with modifier-heavy descriptions ("hushed blaze," "particular joy," "stoically sensitive") that tell the reader how to feel. There is a tendency toward abstract phrasing ("interlaced absence") that distances the reader from the immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is evocative and precise ("settle around her like sediment"), creating a strong textural experience. A slight reliance on repetitive "She [verb]" sentence structures in the latter half holds the score back from the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but marred by sentimental clichés ("grief cracked open like an egg," "mother-love") and filter verbs ("Mei could see"). These artifacts distance the reader from the immediate experience and reduce the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished with high density and strong rhythm. The required phrase "intangibly tangible" is oxymoronic but woven effectively into the reflection on memory. Transitions between the technical and the lyrical are smooth, and the imagery is concrete and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally polished but relies on a repetitive rhetorical loop ("not of land but of belonging," "not of geography, but of people," "not closure, but continuation") that flattens the thematic beats. These parallel constructions feel formulaic rather than cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm ("sieved hush"), but occasional stock phrasing ("swallowed her confession like a stone") and the explicit explanation of the symbol's meaning drag down the line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with good rhythm and density. There is a slight reliance on filter verbs ("Mira watched," "recognized") that distances the reader, but the line-level craft is generally strong and momentum is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is competent and rhythmic, but marred by noticeable clichés ("candle in wind," "fog roll in like old grief") and filter verbs that act as scaffolding. The reliance on standard similes in peak moments flattens the emotional texture that the specific imagery (poles, compass) works hard to build.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished and readable but relies on standard phrasings ("phantom limb", "stopped him cold") and abstract labels for emotion. High-pressure moments lack sensory density, leaning on metaphor ("tunnels waited like questions") rather than concrete, immediate detail.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is rhythmic and functional but relies on some abstract labeling ("Terror and peace existed simultaneously") and familiar fantasy imagery ("pools of starlight," "wind through silver leaves"). While the spice descriptions are imaginative, the reliance on similes to explain emotional states slightly distances the reader from the raw experience of the body horror.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose density is high with strong imagery ("grief preserved in amber"), but the climax relies on summary ("It flooded through her like warm water") rather than dramatized sensation. The "fracture/porcelain" simile is functional but slightly familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery like the "cathedral of salvaged memories." The density is high, though phrases like "liquid starfire" lean slightly toward purple; overall, the line-level craft effectively supports the story's ethereal yet grounded tone.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high adjectival density ("smoldering gaze," "ancient breath," "careful arc," "frozen light"), which occasionally slows the rhythm. The phrase "whispering hush" is effectively justified as a core concept but contributes to a slight redundancy in description. The line-level craft is strong but leans toward "purple" phrasing in the environmental descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is mechanically sound but relies on stock metaphors ("shadows that had suddenly grown teeth," "whispers spreading like fire") that dull the imagery. Exposition often overrides action, with significant word count dedicated to explaining the backstory of the astronomer and the Duke rather than dramatizing the immediate moment.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and flows well, though it relies on a repetitive simile structure ("like silk," "like thoughts," "like tide"). The density of information is good, but the brevity of the piece leaves some moments feeling sketched rather than fully inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose has momentum but suffers from overwritten metaphors and adjectival stacking (e.g., "percussion section for her resurrection"). The phrase "furiously tranquil waves, an oxymoron made weather" is meta-commentary that breaks immersion. Several descriptions feel precious rather than precise, reducing the raw impact of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is generally polished, but crucial moments suffer from clunky execution, notably the expository "Via the coded angles..." and the narrative skip "When it ended." These shortcuts disrupt the momentum and density required for high-quality short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally suffers from overwriting and high adjective density ("luminous and cracked, fractured light through broken glass"). While there are no mechanical errors, the reliance on dense figurative language in place of concrete action sometimes slows the reading pace.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, supporting the musical motif, though it occasionally drifts into overwriting ("horizon blushed," "steely longing"). The sentence mechanics are sound, but the density of adjectives sometimes slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("doubt glowed... like phosphorescence"). The dream sequence relies heavily on filter verbs ("She saw... She saw..."), which distances the reader slightly during the most visceral moment of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished with clear imagery, though it suffers from some overwriting ("calcify into years," "diffuse through the pattern"). The forced inclusion of "rhythmically placid whisper" results in a clunky, adverb-heavy construction that disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety is musical, no template cadence; each paragraph passes the cut test. Metaphors are disciplined—“dust motes swirled in columns of gold”—and never mixed. One minor loop: “dust accumulated… how dust accumulated” in adjacent sentences costs −0.2, but it does not touch the final image. Opening and closing lines are razor-sharp, anchoring voice and resonance without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, emotional register, causal push. No scaffold loops; each fork strike advances pattern. Metaphors are consistent—glass, ice, bloom—without muddled vehicles. Opening and closing lines act as brackets: “held breath” returns as Margaret’s own held breath while she writes. Minor −0.1 for two adjacent “frozen” modifiers; otherwise rhythm breathes with scene temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: “saltwater pooled on his workbench” does world, object, sensory, and metaphoric work in seven words. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances. Figurative language sparse and precise—“books closed like eyes”—no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are propulsive, bookending with luminous object. Minor scaffold: “impossible spaces” repeated twice but serves dream architecture; does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information density is high: one sentence often does three jobs—”The bell had crossed borders in her grandmother's coat pocket, smuggled past checkpoints, carried through refugee camps” delivers heritage, danger, and tactile object in twenty words. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new axis of risk. Metaphors stay physically coherent—moon hung silver, columns glow amber—never mixed. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; final line resolves by image that recharges bell + photograph without exposition. Micro-scaffold only in “This was the architecture of survival,” but its summary is brief and mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence starts avoid template cadence. High density: each sentence layers light, breath, and memory duties. Metaphors stay coherent (jasmine=prayer, fog=ambiguity) and never collide. One minor scaffold: “she would continue her pilgrimage tomorrow” summarizes forward motion that could have been cut, but it occurs post-closure and does not dull image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; strong verbs (“sprawled,” “sliding,” “unwinding”) carry weight without stacked modifiers. Mixed-metaphor vigilance: “water seeking lower ground” beside “threads unwinding” stays coherent because both serve the textile through-line. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One clauses cluster in peak beat (“She touched… She held… She became…”) is patterned repetition taught by prior cadence, hence accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; sentences vary without algorithmic pattern. No synonym loops or filter stacks. Mixed metaphors avoided; “keys… music” metaphor taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is alive—no template cadence or synonym churn. Metaphors stay physically loyal: “cathedral of moss” is accurate to ribbed glass; no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence can weld place, tool, and emotional state (“The forge still functioned, heated now by geothermal vents rather than coal, and above it the aurora’s light filtered…”). Minor scaffold: “pressure from fathoms of water” is a near cliché, but it occurs early and is quickly particularized.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: “jade-tiled walls catching last amber rays” does world, time, and mood in one stroke. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language stays coherent to light motif. Minor scaffold: “practiced invisibility” + “quiet purpose” echo familiar thief phrasing but do not stall beat. Closure line “the moonbeams glowed brighter…” is crisp, undecorated—image carries weight without prose bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, almost every sentence doubles duty: “ice beginning to weep” marries setting + emotion. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors; figurative language sparse but precise.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud cadence breathes with escalating darkness; sentence length shortens as stars thin. No loops or synonym churn; “flaking gold” recurs with accruing agency, not decoration. Metaphors stay physical (“honey-thickened time”) and coherent. One clause (“She had come because the darkness was spreading”) is strategic tell that accelerates ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet audible: “snow fell in slow spirals…each flake another thought” does double sensory-conceptual work. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances archive, atmosphere, or choice. Metaphors stay coherent within physics-override logic. Minor purple tint in “geometries that should not have existed” is justified by POV’s wonder. Final paragraph breathes with short sentences that mimic broom strokes.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“crystal whispering,” “ambiguously clear”—taught early and paid off at closure. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. One mixed-metor risk (“calcified around him like ice”) but ice metaphor is isolated and does not recur. Final line lands on concrete image, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences open with changing parts of speech, avoiding drumbeat. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses: anaphora of “tonight… tonight…” mirrors lantern flicker without drumbeat monotony. Figurative control is tight—water as both mirror and manuscript—avoiding metaphor glut. Information density high: one sentence slips venue history, demolition schedule, and Clara’s insomnia. Minor scaffold: “she had seen what the water revealed as it seeped and stained” could compress, but the loop does not obscure causality and is outside the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm: long breathy sentences under fever, then shorter clauses as decision hardens. Information-dense lines (“She predicted storms with seventy percent certainty…”) fold exposition into voice. Zero paraphrase loops; only two near-adjacent “truth” mentions but separated by image. Metaphors stay meteorological and mutually coherent; no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; figurative language (“tunnel mouth gaped like a confession”) is sparse, taught early, and paid off in the hush motif. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors. Information density high—each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Minor scaffold: “drowsy alertness of three in the morning” is repeated almost verbatim; still under cap.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers image and concept without restatement. Figurative control stays precise—“silt gathered at a river’s bend until something new could grow”—and never clutters the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense but breathable: sensory nouns (dusty perfume, corona flare) do double duty advancing mood and metaphor. One paraphrase loop—“ordinary magic” named twice in closing grafs—slips into template cadence but does not touch final image. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter; punctuation clean. Read-aloud rhythm crests with eclipse darkness, then exhales as light returns, matching emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with ascent/descent motion; sentences vary from fragmentary (“The dragons aren’t decorative”) to sinuous piles that mirror spiral stairs. Occasional elevated latinate diction (“existential axis”) slightly overshoots Maren’s implied lexicon but never loops or muddles causality.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “She trafficked in human truths” compresses career pivot into one line. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (truth as cookie, beam as guide) stay coherent. Sentence variety supports rhythm—long reflective runs broken by staccato fortune slips. Copy-clean; no grammatical or spatial impossibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is strong; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. A few adjective stacks (“ancient and yellow”) could be thinner, and “decorated the silence” appears twice—minor loop. Otherwise propulsion is high; every paragraph advances premise or stakes. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clot.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual data without scaffolding. Figurative language is disciplined—mirrored horizon, honeyed dawn, spiral chambers—each image re-used at closure for echoic payoff. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor loop: “fortunes felt hollow, echoes of echoes” is near-paraphrase, but the repetition serves the emptiness theme so it reads as intentional stutter rather than artifact. Final line is clean, propulsive, leaves resonance vibrating.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The labyrinth was not something she moved through. It was something she perpetually constructed” advances both concept and stakes. Figurative language stays coherent—no mixed metaphors—though density is high, it pattern-pays at closure. No loops or scaffold; each clause adds new angle on self-creation. Near-zero filter verbs; perception is direct.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often sets body, object, and emotional valence (“She felt the silence first…”). No synonym loops; “vibration” recurs but each time with new sensory layer. Metaphors stay physically coherent (light through water). Final third is clean—no figurative muddle to dull closure. Minor scaffold: “She had… she had…” anaphora in para 2 is pattern-taught and pays off in final para, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong info density: single sentences twin action & atmosphere (“settled onto the stone bench, her…journal pressed against her chest”). Few scaffolding repeats; only “she would need to…” forecasts. Metaphors are controlled; no mixed vehicles. Minor paraphrase loop: “the world had forgotten… she always remembered” echoes prior clause, but it tightens theme. Closure line is clean, cadence resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; no template churn. Metaphors (“cathedral of glass and regret”, “crystal shadows”) stay consistent to light/refraction motif. Information-dense: one sentence slips lantern broker past, family grief, present mission. Minor scaffold: “transformation was nearly complete” repeats—deduct 0.2. Otherwise zero paraphrase loops; no mixed vehicles. Closure sentence breathes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphora (“choice by impossible choice”) against clipped notebook scratches. Information density high—one sentence can anchor body, object, concept. Two near-paraphrase loops (“accumulated experience embedded in matter” / “time had texture”) dock −0.2. No mixed metaphors; props tracked cleanly. Closure image (“pattern continued…”) remains luminous, unobscured.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean: 712 words carry orchard, wreck, and emotional arc without scaffold. Figurative language is spare—smoke "settled into everything," bowl "glowed like an ember"—and avoids purple density. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: longer sentences for tide rise, clipped fragments for bow strokes; openings vary, no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—honeyed light, burning fragments—and pays off in the final amber dusk echo. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause advances knowledge or atmosphere. Strong verbs (“fractured,” “hemorrhaging”) replace modifiers. Clean copy, no tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; sentences frequently twin observation with action. One paraphrase loop adjacent: “the cycle continued, as cycles do” merely restates prior paragraph. Metaphors are mixed once (“sharp as barnacle-scraped steel”) yet fit maritime register. No scaffolding or simultaneity errors; closing line lands with cadence lift.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (action + metaphoric charge) without overcrowding. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Metaphors stay internally coherent—crater mist as “iridescent,” arbor veins as “captured starlight”—no mixed logic. High information density: one sentence gives season, terrain, Veren’s vocation, and emotional premise. Final line cadence mirrors circular reed forms, achieving textural payoff without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from sinuous canal sentences to staccato release. Information density high: one sentence often carries sensory cue, emotional state, and world rule. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. “Interrupted cadence” refrain is purposeful pattern, not artifact. Minor elevation in “time is a loop” but paid off immediately in action.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet airy: one sentence often does three jobs (“apple trees… heavy with fruit nourished by the eternal drip” sets scene, stakes metaphor, foreshadows spell-fuel). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each descriptor is unrepeatable. Rhythm breathes—long limb-movement sentences collapse into staccato realizations (“You’re not him”). Only hairline slip: “mathematics of emotion” phrase appears twice; second use is justified as conscious mantra, so artifact stays minor and clear of closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from long breath-opening to staccato mission beats. High information density: one sentence can layer time, object, and emotional cue. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrase (“sapphire hush”) reads as character’s poetic perception, not authorial flourish. Clean grammar, consistent tense, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lines multitask: “moss had claimed every surface” sets scene + agency metaphor + time passage. Metaphors stay botanical, coherent. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Only micro-slip: “purple and inevitable” leans purple-prose but fits storm palette and is forgiven at closure distance. Opening and closing lines anchor and release pressure cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “glistening like a spine emerging from grey flesh” does double sensory and symbolic work. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. One mixed metaphor—“bruise of stone and ruin”—but it’s brief and early, not near closure. Rhythm modulates with tide and breath, propelling the walk without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid, rhythmic, largely loop-free; occasional modifier stacks (“haunting melodies that echoed through the mountain”) slightly dilute urgency. No mixed metaphors or scaffold in peak beats. A tighter cut on some adjectives would lift this toward 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences carry double duty (image + back-fill). No loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“verdigris,” “luminescence”) is justified by archivist POV. One scaffold sentence: “She began her work methodically…” merely labels the next paragraph; cutting it would sharpen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: "mist curled...like breath from sleeping giants" sets lyric tone, then yields to concrete railway jargon without strain. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances either mystery or surrender. Figurative language pauses at the threshold—"cracks spider across stone in perfect directional notation"—letting metaphor serve map-maker's eye rather than purple display. Opening and closing lines perform bookend resonance without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “Tears fell onto the page, but Mira kept writing” advances action, embodies emotion, tightens rhythm. No scaffold loops; only two near-paraphrases (“skeptical of everything…skeptical of this place”) serve thematic emphasis. Figurative language stays coherent—whales “sculpting space,” starlight “refracted into shapes.” Final line varies cadence, anchoring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty (“The fragment burned away, its curse fulfilled not by knowledge but by the courage to seek it”). One paraphrase loop mid-story—“immortality without purpose was just a longer death” closely echoes earlier tedium note, a −0.2 ding. Metaphors stay coherent: prismatic → origami → hushed thunder, each image folding into the next. Final line lands with imagistic snap, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences do double duty (ink pot as both heirloom and tax); no scaffold loops; figurative language is sparse, precise (“death dressed in chemical perfume”); opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif; zero mixed metaphors or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “Cherry blossoms fell like pink snow” carries fresh synesthesia without cliché because next clause grounds it in cedar patience. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; each sentence layers texture or advances ritual. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath; final line recharges “worn spine” as archive of intangible dawns—image reweights all prior material. Micro-blemish: “impossibly old” appears twice in 200 words, a hairline echo that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence compounds image + knowledge: “containers… creating canyons of forgotten cargo and shadow” does three jobs in nine words. Metaphors stay physically coherent—no mixed vehicles—and compress under pressure rather than bloom. Opening line hooks voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the new rule set. Density is so high that removing any paragraph would collapse either spatial clarity or emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; sentences pull double duty (sensorial + emotional). No loops or scaffold; metaphors consistent. One mixed vehicle: “observatory held her grief like cupped hands” after dome-as-skull is minor. Density high; read-aloud rhythm varies. Closure line clean, resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally clean, with strong nouns and verbs; occasional elevated phrasing (“extinction list she had been compiling since childhood”) nudges register but remains in character. One scaffold loop: “she had…before the…” repeats structure twice in close proximity. No mixed metaphors; imagery stays coherent. Final sentence lands with punch; rhythm supports momentum rather than stalls it.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies without algorithmic repetition. Sentences multitask: “She felt it in the uneven distribution of heat” simultaneously advances plot and reveals method. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent (mist as breath, rails as veins). One paraphrase loop: “She had learned… she had learned…” → −0.2. Otherwise crisp, high-density prose that propels rather than decorates.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level propulsion high: each clause either charts environment or sharpens interior contradiction. Figurative control: “rusted outpost… ashamed of itself” gives architecture emotional stakes without mixed metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffolding. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “herald the correction”—mirrors protagonist’s precision obsession, so allowed. Final line cadence earns its quiet uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is near-flawless: high density, zero loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language serves resonance instead of ornament. Opening and closing lines function as tuning strikes, anchoring motif and release. Minor elevation in register (“conceptual repricing,” “symmetric satisfaction”) is brief and motif-driven, never muddying causality.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe with action. Figurative language is spare and purposeful—no mixed-metaphor clutter. One scaffold loop: “the gathered hush… the lonesome splendor” is repeated almost verbatim; trimming one would tighten. Otherwise high density, zero paraphrase loops, and strong propulsion to the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally taut; sentences multitask (“The copperlight of dusk filtered through salt-crusted windows, casting everything in amber stillness” sets time, place, mood, visual filter in one blow). A few near-duplicates—“something hunting… something that wore silence”—slip into template cadence but not at climax. Mixed-metaphor watch: “hush given form” and “void where light bent wrong” stay internally consistent. No loops, no scaffolding, no artifact drag on the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Sentences double-duty—e.g., “roots drank from quicksilver streams that whispered secrets older than grief” advances world-rule and atmosphere. Figurative language avoids overstacking; each metaphor (iron bones, frozen cobwebs) distinct and purposeful. Minor scaffold: “endless night for three generations now” tells count that could be shown earlier, but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes—long sentences for memory, staccato for needlework—without template cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned (water, breath, thread) and pays off in the starlit plate image. One scaffold detected: “paths…paths…paths” triplet in paragraph four; minor, does not obscure causality. Opening and closing images are propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, almost lyrical yet free of purple loops: “roots threading through skulls like patient fingers” does triple sensory work. No scaffold sentences or synonym churn; each clause advances image, stakes, or emotion. Filter verbs appear twice but are voice-motivated. The final paragraph repeats “interrupted journey,” but it’s a deliberate callback, not artifact. Closure line (“growing light from bone”) is crisp, unadorned, and recharges every prior motif.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from fluid cadence to clipped final drop; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layer is selective—amber cathedral, veins of mail—never overwrought. Information dual-loads: “ebony clipboard pressed against her chest” conveys object, emotion, and ritual in one touch. Clean copy, zero artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: winding sentences for stitching, clipped beats for eavesdropping. Information is dense—each thread color, fleet position, and name-drop carries double duty. Metaphors (coins of fate, stepping stones across dark water) are fresh and internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffolding: two “spiral” images near-open could compress; otherwise no loops or synonym churn. Closure line (“stories yet to be told”) is crisp, resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic; figurative language is selective—silvered voices, breath on glass—never clotted. One scaffold risk: “she had kept it without knowing why” repeats prior information, but beat advances to mother’s motive. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Read-aloud cadence peaks at the whispered “Mama,” then subsides with the parting mangroves.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“warm honey” anesthetic, “brain coral fragment,” “shrapnel they would remove” each perform double duty (sensation + symbol). Metaphors are coherent: coral = structural memory; no mixed vehicles. No filter-verb stacks; sentences open varied. One minor overwriting puff: “lotus-hearted ache” edges purple but is earned by prior lotus-less mist imagery and pays off in final line cadence. Grammar clean; pronoun track immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentences for fog layering, staccato “She laughed” for release. Metaphors stay coherent—film, orchard, beacon—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold trace: “She understood now that…” could trim, but it’s isolated. High information density; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, historical data without pad.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: varying sentence length, strategic enjambment, and paragraph breaks that breathe with the lullaby flow. Figurative language is dense but purposeful—every metaphor (calcium prayers, pollen peace) returns to reef biology, preventing mixed-metaphor drift. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. One hairline slip: “photosynthesize that darkness” is technically inaccurate (plants photosynthesize light, not dark) but the poetic license is brief and thematically transparent, so clarity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or emotion. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors (“cathedral of silence,” “calcified grief”) and both are ear-worthy. Information density is high: one paragraph delivers archive lore, sibling history, and thematic premise without stall. Rhythm breathes: long reflective sentences alternate with staccato admissions, mirroring the move from hesitation to cadenced honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty—description advances both atmosphere and engineering logic. Zero paraphrase loops; each new detail adds pressure or tool knowledge. Metaphors are consistent: volcanic respiration = moral respiration. One tiny scaffold—“she understood now”—but immediately paid by embodied memory. Read-aloud rhythm is flawless, mirroring the amphitheater’s inhale/exhale cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often does atmosphere + memory + foreshadowing. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into confession, then relaxes into dust-image cadence. Register holds; no corporate diction. Final third is clean, allowing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet limpid: “wood whispered of a forest near an airfield” does triple duty—setting, character, backstory. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned early (light-lies, fractured hush) and paid off at closure without muddle. Rhythm accelerates into the final three clauses, mirroring the stop of drift.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence can world-build, characterize, and foreshadow (“pressure-sealed and breathing recycled air like a creature in hibernation”). Mixed metaphors are avoided; “liquid aurora” extends but does not contradict prior optics. One scaffold trace: “she breathed in, breathed out” is template-cadence, but it replicates the very respiration being dramatized and is forgiven. Closing line (“Some belonging grows in the pause between lights…”) propels without expositional drag.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned (light/memory/glass) and paid off; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “crystal” and “light” repeat in adjacent lines mid-story (−0.2). Closure line is clean, propulsive. No filter-verb clusters. Overall rhythm breathes with escalating beats.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies—long reflective sentences contract into tight clauses under pressure (“Coins clinked… startled birds”). No loops or scaffold; every sentence moves. Figurative language is disciplined: “applause scattered like startled birds” is earned, singular, not piled. Only minor slip: “seemed to glow in harmony with” is a faint filter hedge; excising “seemed” would sharpen the beat. Closure line is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; no template chains. Mixed metaphors avoided—“starlight pooled like spilled mercury” holds physical logic. Information-dense: one line can set, characterize, and foreshadow (“Here…beyond the Magisters’ reach, she practiced…”). Minor scaffold: “She remembered everything. She remembered because…” repetition deliberate but still loops; costs −0.2. No freshness issues in peak beat. Closure image clean. Overall propulsion high with only hairline loop preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense: one sentence delivers glass origin, pier decay, and dawn timing without slack. Metaphors are tactile—light “streams,” ripples “intersect” pilings—avoiding mixed vehicles. No loops or paraphrase stacks; each sentence advances image or stance. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“noctilucent,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register above the glazier’s likely lexicon, warranting a small deduction but never obscuring causality or dulling the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Figurative density spikes only at two pressure points (wax rivers, meteor ash) and both images repay by recharging closure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image that fuses brokenness with continuance. Syntax varies naturally; no template cadence or scaffold. High information density: “cracked porcelain box pressing against his chest through his jacket pocket” performs object state, sensory pressure, and paternal tenderness in one sweep.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm fluid; sentence length variety mirrors breathing of cave. Density high: “grief had driven her to the coastline and desperation had led her underground” collapses backstory into one propulsive line. Occasional adjective stacks (“serene upheaval,” “patient ocean”) verge on overwriting but are patterned early and reinforce theme. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding; pronouns clean, grammar exact.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence layers sensory or historical information without scaffold. Metaphors are few and coherent—“echoes nested like fossils”—never overwritten. No loops, synonym churn, or register drift. Opening and closing lines frame voice and stake cleanly; final sentence propels outward, not explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety is excellent—no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense but patterned (light as grammar of possibility) and pays off in the final rainbow image. One scaffold trace: “the painting guided her rather than the reverse” edges toward aphorism, but it is brief and functional. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the bell-cued deadline, propelling to the final line without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. High information density—clipboard history, celestial mechanics, named dead—packed without scaffolding. Metaphors (wildflowers in bones, moons indifferent yet complicit) cohere and reappear at closure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, no template runs. Information dense—“manufactured drought” paragraph packs three years of hydropolitics in 54 words. Mixed metaphor patrol: “sound like God clearing his throat” stays within sky-thunder logic, no clash. Minor scaffold: “she had… she had…” anaphora is purposeful, pattern-taught. Zero loops, zero filter-verb clusters. Final line lands on monosyllabic punch—“Especially then.”—without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    Paragraph lengths swell and contract like breath, mirroring the untangling cadence. Metaphors are stacked but purposeful—each knot is a “voice, a memory, a piece of someone”—creating a texture that justifies its own density. No loops or scaffold; every sentence either advances the harvest or deepens the cold. Occasional elevated diction (“ontological,” “sovereign choice”) skirts register drift yet feels earned by the ceremonial stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Metaphors (fallen moon, meteor hush) are sparse, precise, paid off by closure. High information density: one line slips brush/ink case into puppet casket without exposition. Zero paraphrase loops; “meteor hush” appears once and resonates. Final line breathes, stops—perfect cadence match to earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: clipped clauses during construction, airy elongation during wait, hush at wing-whisper. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (“frozen melody” for knotted rope). No paraphrase loops; each sentence either advances frame-building or deepens atmosphere. Minor filter verbs appear but serve Vera’s observational mode without dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “She cast no bronze that night, melted no wax” condenses two occupations into negation that advances theme. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new tactile or causal information. Metaphors (aurora as memory) stay consistent with the story’s physics of light and resonance. The only hairline slip is the echoed “permanence required first letting go,” a near-paraphrase that slightly dulls the penultimate beat.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is read-aloud clean, zero loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“storm growled with the patience of something that had already decided its path”—no mixed metaphors. Information density high: one sentence can world-build, escalate, and embody emotion. No artifacts in closure beat; final line is monosyllabic punch after prior lyric swell.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is clean, high-density; only two adjacent near-paraphrases (“empty observatories…abandoned calculation halls”) slip into mild loop. Metaphors stay coherent—bridge of numbers, breadcrumbs of truth—without purple drift. Final line cadence is ear-tested; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is taut, rhythmic, information-dense; every sentence carries dual duty—image and implication. Figurative control keeps metaphors consistent (soundlessness as vacuum, memory as marrow) without mixed vehicles. No loops, no scaffold; even abstract nouns like “resentment” are immediately tethered to skeleton imagery. One near-purple line—“reality shifted like breath”—survives because the pattern of breath-as-time is taught early and returned at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: “seventeen years of mirrors and fog” compresses time; frost crystals “forming and reforming in patterns that almost resembled writing” does triple sensory/image/metaphor duty. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Metaphors are coherent—mirror/sea/spire glass family—no mixed vehicles. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy maintained. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with fog pulse; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Minor hairline: “glass mountains” repeated three times; intention is incantatory, not accidental, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong density: single sentences often do setting + emotion + metaphor (“apple trees rooted in centuries of accumulated dust and decay, their branches heavy with fruit that glowed like lanterns”). One paraphrase loop (“We persist… we keep coming back”) is intentional motif, not artifact. No mixed metaphors or scaffold in peak beats. Final line cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; strong verbs (“carved,” “humming”) propel. One paraphrase loop (“bewildered still but purposefully so”) is minor; no mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter. Clean proofing.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence variety is strong; opening nautilus simile teaches the spiral logic that recurs at closure. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing of rescue itself”) barely stays within POV’s scholarly lexicon. One paraphrase loop—“rescues them… It rescues them”—is noticeable but does not obscure causality. Figurative density spikes in the climax yet remains coherent; no mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long languid clauses mimic fog drift, then staccato “Come back.” Information density high—one sentence can set atmosphere, reveal backstory, and foreshadow stakes. Only two minor loops: “memory without truth” echoes “truth without release” in adjacent beats; “rusted Ferris wheel” repeated descriptor. No mixed metaphors; diction stays within POV lexicon. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the green cue cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive; figurative language sparse and purposeful. One scaffold loop: “methodically, the way her grandmother had taught her…” could trim to one clause. Otherwise zero loops, mixed metaphors, or filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet limber: “She had not conquered the storm. She had simply found its eye…” compresses arc and theme in two sentences. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sensory verbs are specific—stone “pulsed,” walls “whispered through touch alone.” Final line achieves resonant brevity without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and multi-tasking: “She set the broken prism on the pavilion’s central pedestal, where the humming reached its purest tone” advances action, object geography, and sensory texture simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“color of infected wounds” mirrors emotional fallout. Tense and pronoun reference stable. Only minor elevation into poetic register (“shard of hush”) but pattern is taught early and pays off, so no register drift penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Opening line anchors voice and metaphor in one stroke; final line resolves by image. Figurative language is sparse, tide-metaphor returning only when it can accrue new emotional density. High information density: thirty years of backstory compressed into two concrete clauses without synopsis drag. Proofing is clean; pronoun reference never drifts across mother/daughter.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty—sound physics, paternal grief, world lore—without syntactic scaffold. Metaphors are few, clean, and physically coherent. Only a faint cadence echo (“the terrace simply…”) drifts toward template, not enough to blunt the final line. Read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally with cable tension.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; no mixed metaphors. Information density high: one sentence slips mural reveal, emperor pointer, and spatial directive. Sentence variety mirrors emotional arc—long latency clauses in orchard calm, staccato prepositional phrases on the stair. Opening and closing lines bookend with light imagery, creating cadence symmetry. Micro-movements serve purpose: “pressed the ruby flake” is the precise tactile beat that triggers translucence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. High information density: “threshold was fading…” does world-rule, interior symptom, and time marker in one stroke. Mixed metaphors are kept coherent (smoke, membrane, grief). Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Closing line (“doorways…both directions”) lands with rhythmic snap and semantic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean and double-jobbing: each sentence either thickens atmosphere or advances causality. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles (pressure → diamonds) stay internally consistent. Opening line anchors voice and fantastic rule in one blow; closing line recharges “growing brighter” motif without repeating it. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “resonant reconfiguration”—reads as narrator’s earned technical confidence rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or decision. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“golden shadows,” “bridge of intuition”—never stacked. High information density: one clause often performs description, metaphor, and causality. Final line lands with crystalline brevity after prior controlled cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong rhythmic variety and high-density lines (“each piece fall to the earth with a muffled thud”) propel the surrender. Occasional elevated diction (“phosphorescence,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register drift but never clots the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“dust patterns like scripture”). Opening and closing lines perform framing work. One participle opener (“Presenting this button…”) is tolerated without clarity harm. Clean copy, strong paragraph cut-test pass.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally crisp, but small loops appear: "quietly, resourcefully" echoed near identical phrasing within sixty words; "they would...they never" template cadence repeats. Figurative control good—no mixed metaphors—yet rhythm could vary more under stealth tension. No artifacts touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with performance: long sentences for sustained tones, staccato fragments for silence pockets. No scaffold/loop; each sentence advances image or beat. Figurative density peaks at closure but remains coherent (“propeller of light” stays optic). Opening line anchors stakes and voice; final line resolves by image that recharges dew and spectrum. Minor near-repetition of “quietly vivid” twice in two paragraphs is justified by thematic reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentences for monotony of sorting, then staccato fragments at revelation. Information density high—each sentence advances mythos, character, or image. No scaffold loops; “she” opens only when intentional. Metaphors stay coherent (volcanic soot clouds, moonstone light) and serve theme. Proofing clean; only “endlessly in all directions” skirts cliché but is earned by arbor scale.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “spray dampening her gray hair” sets age, bodily stake, and weather in five words. No filler loops; each paragraph advances discovery or stance. Metaphors are internally coherent—entropy as cracked glass, certainty as “lie more convincingly.” Minor scaffold: two adjacent “she would” futures could compress, but they occur pre-closure and do not blunt momentum. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during dig, then exhales on final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Figurative language is dense—three metaphors in four lines at climax—but the pattern is taught early (“lanterns… like scattered stars”) and pays off in the final alloy image, so the density feels purposeful rather than accidental scaffold. One paraphrase loop: “weight of his name shifted… no longer purely leaden” restates the prior sentence’s idea; minor −0.2. No tense or pronoun drift; props track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Information-dense: single sentences deliver backstory (“three centuries”) and present action (“descended…illuminating nothing so much as her own uncertainty”). Metaphors sustain sonic motif—notes “slide like water finding cracks”—without crowding. Zero scaffold/loops; pronoun and tense immaculate. Final clause “the ache glowed” reframes prior metaphor without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences perform world-building, sensory punch, and character state (“The ultraviolet forest hummed with frequencies that only Elena could feel now”). Metaphors are coherent—forest as computer, pollen as data—and never mixed. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with her physical strain. Clean grammar and pronoun reference; no typos or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. High information density: “ Dust lay thick… particles settled told stories…” does triple duty (setting, character skill, foreshadow). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph avoids sentimental closure; “weightless burden” is earned by prior weight imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Ear test passes: cadence rises and falls with the frost’s crystalline swell and the final shatter. Information density is high—“bottled whisper, harvested from the last words of a dying star” packs world, trade, and myth into one clause. Metaphor stack is controlled: each glass image refracts light differently, avoiding self-contradiction. Minor scaffold: “perfect systems… afraid to change” is abstract synopsis that could have been dramatized through a single stalled patron encounter; this keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers image, backstory, and world rule (“baroque asteroid… carved into impossible spirals… civilization once breathed”). No synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent (temporal flow = wind, architecture = sail). Minor scaffold: “three standard years” appears twice in quick succession (−0.2). Final third is clean; no artifact touches closure. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested, propulsive. Strong verbs (“drifted,” “carved,” “sailed”) replace modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet musical: “copper walls singing sympathetic harmonics” fuses setting and action in one clause. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends the acoustic field. One mixed risk—“covenant of rust” personification—earns its keep by returning as transformed literal glitter. Final paragraph varies cadence to echo a music-box fade-out.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but propulsive: every clause adds scent, geology, or emotional tilt. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Opening sentence is a 28-word single breath that still orients time, occupation, and motive—masterful. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she realized,” “she understood”) could be trimmed, yet they occur in low-tempo reflection; peak beat is pure image, so 9-range is still reachable.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose breathes with storm cadence—short slashes for rain, elongated clauses for reverie; no loops or mixed metaphors. Information density high: one sentence often layers GPS failure, electromagnetic chaos, and alliance signal. Minor scaffold: “she would...she would...” future loop in penultimate paragraph trims 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Information density high—“amber pavilion,” “honey-colored panes,” “copper light” tri-loads visual data in six words without clutter. Metaphors stay coherent (darkness as clientele, not mixed). Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or motive. Punctuation and tense immaculate. Only micro-slip: “quietly driven” phrase repeated thrice; costs −0.1, still within high band.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    Rhythm flexes with pressure: long, tide-like clauses in flight tighten to fragment bursts under desert sun, mirroring pulse. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal data. Figurative vehicles stay physically accurate—“beach debris as messages” sustains double duty as literal code and metaphor for silenced testimony. No register drift; “aquifer,” “pneumatic tube,” “retrocognitively” belong to Celeste’s professional lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean, high-density; sentences double-duty (e.g., “amber bottle with no opening—a paradox of glass” sets object + theme). No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filler stacks. Minor overwrite in “hollow promises” but does not touch closure. Final line “They held light” is crisp, recharges motif. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentence anchors tower, garden, time, profession. No synonym loops; “wax shaving” never padded. Figurative language controlled—one mixed metaphor check (“sky the color of bruised plums”) but image coherent. Read-aloud rhythm: paragraph breath mirrors foghorn silence/dawn resumption. Closure beat clean, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: long image-sentences breathe, then staccato verbs (“She held…began to hum”) accelerate the beat. Information density is high—each sentence seeds both world-rule and emotional stake. Minor scaffold: “frozen” appears eight times; replacing two instances with specific textures (rime, hoar) would sharpen without loss. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clusters; the single passive (“was re-categorized”) is voice-motivated to stress the world’s shift rather than her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near-immaculate: information multi-tasks (“the air tasted thin and the light arrived unfiltered by the world’s accumulated grief” sets altitude, POV bias, and thematic tone in one breath). No loops or synonym churn; figurative language is restrained to one vehicle per beat. Opening sentence hooks with paradox—“storms came to die”—and the final line recharges it: “whispers of weather that only the faithful could hear.” A single moment of elevated diction—“cathedral bell rope… thick braided hemp”—reads purposeful, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; sentences layer image and idea without paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“flourishing stillness,” “primal elegance”) flirts with loftiness but stays anchored in sensory payoff. No scaffold or mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates with celestial sweep vs. joint ache. Final line cadence earns its quiet uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, zero scaffolds; every sentence doubles duty (action + atmosphere). Figurative layer is spare—“bees in amber and gold” appears once and charges closure; no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Only one adjective pair could be cut (“weathered hands”), but the density elsewhere is so high the micro-fat does not impede propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “garage sale item descriptions, hundreds of them, scrolling in pale blue light” compresses world-rule and exposition in one stroke. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—longer sentences for wonder, clipped fragments when capsule cracks. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Opening and final lines are image-driven, propulsive. Proofing clean; only nit a repeated “the” in “the particular silence” but does not cloud causality.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences breathe with lagoon-paced rhythm, then shorten during repair; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors in 700+ words, each purposeful. One near-scaffold: “surface holding the sky like polished glass” could collapse into cliché, but it’s immediately complicated by droplet interference. Information density high; each detail later recurs (kelp, feather asymmetry, ink smudge). Minor -0.2 for “burnished hush” register flirtation.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose shows high density: single sentences deliver diagnosis, ferry return, and diary significance. Varied sentence openings, no template cadence detected. Metaphors (petrified giants, heartbeats) appear once per image, not stacked. Final line “threads of connection between worlds” is earned callback, not ornamental. Zero loops or synonym churn; information advances every line.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences layer chemistry, myth, and grief without scaffolding. Figurative language mostly apt (“stones grinding underwater”) though two adjacent metaphors for twilight sea edge toward excess. No loops, stock openers, or filter-verb stacks. High information-to-word ratio; each sensory stroke advances scene. Proofing clean; only minor cadence repetition (“each evening… each morning”) but reads purposeful. Final line lands with resonant lift.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often does world-build, backstory, and emotional charge (“She had retired from finding corpses the day she realized…”). Metaphors stay physically coherent—rust bleeding, metal dreaming—no mixed vehicles. Occasional adjective uplift (“colorless sky”) is earned by prior sensory overload. Final third is clean: no loops, no scaffold; the last line’s cadence mirrors the first’s hush, recharging “wild hush” without repeating it.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong information density: one sentence often layers physical action, emotional charge, and world rule (“She pulled out her worn journal, its pages filled with hundreds of star maps drawn in careful graphite”). No scaffold loops; metaphors are consistent (taffy, spider silk, honey). Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for dilated time, staccato for the heartbeat moment. One minor register drift—“temporal-patient fingers” is vivid but momentarily self-conscious; does not obscure closure. Proofing clean; pronoun track perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold loops. Two mixed metaphors—“color of bruised plums” and “living thing waiting to be let in”—compete slightly but both serve atmosphere. Information density high: each paragraph advances goal or reveals world. One template cadence: “wonder laughed… wonder danced… wonder wept” triad; reads intentional and pattern-taught, so waived. Closure image clean: “descended… with the cure in his pocket and the sundial lid in his hand.”

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with circling motion; sentence length varies from staccato footfall beats to longer accumulative clauses. No synonym churn or template cadence. Metaphors are sparse, precise—“luminous absence,” “nomadic penumbra”—each reappears to reweight meaning at closure. Zero filter-verb stacks; every clause advances memory-density or physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm varies from incantatory catalogues to clipped inscription beats; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—each metaphor (language as terrain, mountain as book) returns to reweight closure. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances image or stakes. Copy is clean; pronouns unambiguous despite shifting corridors.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is spare, rhythmic, high-density: “woven hush” carries three jobs (acoustic, tactile, moral). No synonym loops; metaphor vehicles stay consistent (labyrinth = guilt). One near-miss: “productive in their restlessness” edges toward abstraction but is saved by immediate tactile threading that follows. Read-aloud cadence peaks at knight-drop, then exhales cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary from long breathless anaphoric runs to fragmentary whispers; no template cadence. Figurative language is patterned early (“light through glass”) and paid off at climax. Zero paraphrase loops; each refract line adds new facet. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; information density high—“cathedral of gears and cogs suspended above dissolution” does triple setting-atmosphere-character work. Metaphors are coherent: acid sea = hunger; gold veins = meaning; no mixed vehicles. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Opening line hooks voice and stakes; final line (“carrying its uncertain keeper toward whatever dawn might come”) resolves by image that recharges earlier uncertainty motif. No overwriting in peak beat—final light burst is one crisp sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is loop-free; each sentence forwards image or causality. Metaphors are concrete and internally coherent: “cathedral built by water and time,” “mineral tears.” No synonym churn or template cadence. High density: “He packed his easel, his worn brushes, and the painted seashell…” packs three tools of survival in one breath. Closure sentence—“the painted seashell rode beside him, its faded sunset catching the last light of day”—delivers charged poise without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry double duty: “She positioned each mirror according to the coordinates… creating a constellation of reflections” simultaneously shows action, stakes, and cosmic scale. No paraphrase loops; each line adds new pressure or specificity. Figurative language is spare, sea-sharp: “mechanical joints groaning like something wounded,” “starlight fracturing into a thousand directed beams.” Opening and closing lines act as thesis and chorus without repeating phrasing. Copy-clean except one permissible comma splice that propels urgency. Noise-free, high-density.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    High density: one sentence = storm damage + emotional math + world rule. Rhythm breathes between analytic cataloguing and sensual image. Zero mixed metaphors; “gold filigree threading through the white like rivers on a map” is precise and consistent. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence variety avoids template cadence; metaphors (dock as “pale finger,” twilight as “bruised”) are spare, never stacked. Information density high: one sentence slips biographical data, sensory detail, and emotional stance (“weathered hands clutching the logbook that had washed ashore three days prior”). No scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. Minor near-loop: “mist” appears four times in closing paragraph—just under overuse threshold, forgiven because it is the accruing agent.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary length and opening; high information density—each line advances image, stakes, or world rule. Figurative language sparse under pressure; only two metaphors in climax, both physically grounded. One minor scaffold: “the creek continued rising behind her” repeats prior cue without new tactical info, but it does not blur cause/effect or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid, high-density: one line often does two jobs—“starlight bleeding, actually bleeding” marries visual wonder to plot clue. No paraphrase loops; metaphor stack is limited to two per beat and stays coherent. Opening anchors voice and stakes; closing line weaponizes motif. Some poetic compounds (“luminous ichor,” “ember grotto”) flirt with excess but serve atmosphere; no clarity lost at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often performs atmosphere, characterization, and causal push. No paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay coherent—corona, spiral, column—forming a closed set that culminates in the dimming sun. Minor scaffold: “scientifically romantic” appears once as label; does not recur. Final line earns cadence stop without drumbeat monotony. Clean copy, zero typos.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    No loops, scaffolds, or synonym churn. Information-dense lines: “chronicling lucid dreams for eleven years… cartographer mapping shifting continents” packs backstory and metaphor in one stroke. Figurative language restrained; when used (“valley floor a quilt”), it’s precise and brief. Opening and closing lines echo birch/snow without repetition fatigue. Minor cadence echo—“She’d… She’d…” x2—acceptable as pattern reinforcement.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent—city tears/fog, time in droplets—without mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often does two jobs (reveals screw damage + backstory guilt). No scaffolding; paragraph cuts test clean. Final line—“time itself could be touched, tasted in the rhythm of water drops”—recharges opening motif with new weight.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Figurative language is disciplined—one metaphor per high-pressure beat, no mixed vehicles. Sentence rhythm varies: opening lyrical cadence, clipped fragments during frost surge. Information dense: steam curl recalls scar shape; tea colour mirrors storm light. No synonym loops or scaffold. Minor over-adjectiving in “spilled ink” robe image keeps it from 9.0, but artifact does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm modulates: cumulative clauses for archive dust, staccato for generator click. No filter-verb stacks; props (bottle, copper coils) are handled, not catalogued. One micro-loop: “nothing is ever truly lost” / “sometimes things simply wait…” is a near-paraphrase; tolerable because it’s the character’s verbal tic. Final line “ethereal gray morning” risks modifier overload but lands as tonal chord, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm modulates gracefully between long suspended clauses and short declarative pulses, mirroring the spiral’s tightening. Figurative language is dense but coherent—vehicles consistently return to light, fabric, spatial curvature—no contradictory metaphors. Occasional stacked modifiers (“impossible spirals,” “resounding hush”) flirt with excess yet stay within lyric contract taught at opening. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence adds new layer of perception or concept, sustaining momentum toward blank-page coup.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors are disciplined (“fjord quiet… like something alive,” “sound like breaking ice”) and do not overpopulate high-pressure beats. Information density is high: each sentence advances either sensory detail, backstory, or concept. Opening and closing lines are strong—first line anchors metaphorical premise; last line releases the key image to echo absence. Minor scaffold: “seventeen years” and “three winters” are tell-tags, but they compress necessary backstory without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences layer light, color, and metaphor without synonym churn. Opening line anchors stakes and glow; final line resolves by image (“quiet wildfire”). One mixed-metaphor watch: “wildfire of luminescence” is thermally odd for underground fungi yet reads as deliberate oxymoron. No scaffolds or loops; information density high.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory anchoring, backstory shard, and forward pressure—“water cascade down windows that hadn’t been properly sealed since 1987” situates, dates, and signals decay. No scaffold loops; even the repeated “she would” is purposeful, iterative resolve. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“submarine light”). A single mixed metaphor—“melancholy wrapped around her like a gentle melancholy”—is tautological but low-pressure and does not touch closure. The final line is clean, propulsive, and image-locked.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence slips in lamp-shift timing, rotary dial as teeth, and emotional temperature of night city. Figurative language is selective—no metaphor pile-ups—each image returns (glass = goodbye curve, rainbow = re-framing grief). Rhythm breathes with scene: long clause to open call, staccato during micro-turn, hush at closure. No scaffold, synonym loops, or tense drift; prose is read-aloud clean.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences carry image + backstory + emotional tilt simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One near-repeat: “weight of small moments” appears twice—first as thematic seed, finally as abstraction; distance prevents 9+. Opening and closing lines are sharp, cadence varied. Grammar clean; pronoun tracks cleanly through Keeper encounter.</question>
    <question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
    <comment>Premise—town archive that metaphysically sustains civility via grocery lists—is fresh, non-obvious, yet emotionally credible. Mythic Keeper rising from jetty planks feels novel but grounded in prior letters. Transformation test fails minimally: core insight could transplant to another keeper-of-ephemera profession, but walnut-ink and locket particularize enough. Risk is moderate, not bold; no structural experimentation.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no algorithmic drumbeat. High density: “stolen, technically, though she preferred borrowed” compresses ethics in one line. Figurative language is spare and accurate—“living shrouds,” “gentle chains”—never overwrought. Zero paraphrase loops; pronoun tracking clean across fox/antecedent. Only micro-slip: “improbably, a laboratory hummed” skirts scaffold adverb, but immediacy recovers next clause.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breathy clauses and staccato sense beats, supporting the musical-trail tension. Figurative language is dense but patterned (tree grammar, emotional geometries) so it teaches its own idiom; no mixed metaphors. Minor paraphrase loops (“frequencies... frequencies”) recur but never touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.4)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: information-dense yet airy (“encoding it with what she believed was universal mathematics”). Metaphors are coherent (wet paper → starlight centuries late) and sparse enough to avoid purple fog. Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffold, zero template cadence. The single “impossible directions” is the only minor cliché; otherwise rhythm, tense, and propulsion are immaculate through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from long wave-like clauses to staccato signing beats; no template cadence. Information density is high—one line can layer sensory cue, backstory pinch, and thematic seed: “I would feel the vibrations through the floorboards.” Figurative language is selective; when stacked (“quiet certainty of someone accustomed to going unnoticed”) it serves characterization, not ornament. Zero loops, zero scaffold; closing line lands with propulsive snap.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new information or emotional charge. Metaphors are volcanic, coherent, and paid off: ash, cinders, melted stone. Information density is high—three months off-grid, seventeen-year tapestry fragment, genealogical wall of art—yet clarity remains. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence modulates from urgent staccato to reverent long vowels in the final paragraph without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and world data (“golden glow intensified, waves forming patterns that matched her rhythm”). No synonym loops or template cadence. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Paragraph cuts tight; each advances knowledge or charge. Minor scaffold: “she had been” opener appears twice; doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry double duty—sound physics, backstory, and emotional tilt in single breaths. No loops or scaffold; metaphor is spare (“ribbons of green and violet”) and tied to aurora physics. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line cadence mirrors the hush it describes. Only nit: two “every” openers in paragraph 3 create a faint template echo.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is near flawless: no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each sentence layers image + motive + micro-setting. Opening “cobalt dock stretched into the canal like a bruise healing” fuses color, tactility, and process in one stroke. Density high—“water pooled between the warped planks, each puddle holding fragments of the overcast sky” does three jobs. Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses build stillwater tension, then short “She did not call out” snaps like a shutter. Final line “spiralingly calm” crystallizes cadence and theme without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm breathes with scene temperature: languid anaphora in description, staccato prepositional beats during motion. No synonym loops or template cadence; each metaphor is singular (“library emerged… like a bruise on the evening”). Information density is high—one sentence often layers time, motive, and sensory cue. A single mixed-metaphor bruise/mist overlap is forgivable at this length and does not recur. Final image lands clean without scaffold: “She walked home through the mist, cradling hope like a fragile queen, ready for the board.”

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, imagistic, high-density; most sentences do double duty (action + emotional translation). No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (turbine blades as clock, as surveillance). Rhythm modulates: long anaphoric paragraph on “because” accelerates toward close, then clipped final line. Opening and closing lines are pruned to nerve.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: “humming quartz colonnade” does triple duty—setting, tool, metaphor. Varied sentence length accelerates with pressure, breathes during reflection. No mixed metaphors; cobalt / twilight / glass stack remains coherent. Minor loop: “had…had…” in para 2, but momentum recovers immediately. Final line lands on concrete image, not abstraction, satisfying closure read-aloud test.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is taut; sentences multitask—e.g., “glass remnants catching light she could only partially perceive” seeds both setting and handicap. Metaphors are clean (ash-and-amber sky) with no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “beauty in what others called imperfection” echoed twice in adjacent clauses; minor −0.2. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes image without over-explanation. No scaffold or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: single sentences layer time, sensory cross-talk, and emotional stakes (“The mother reached across a century, across death itself, still calling”). No mixed metaphors; lens-beam → spectrum → loom thread is coherent. One paraphrase loop detected (“connection wasn’t transaction… connection was willingness”) costs −0.2. No artifacts in final third; closure image is uncluttered. Read-aloud rhythm varies with bell-strike repetition used as purposeful pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “starlight poured through the damaged sections” does triple duty—image, emotion, theme. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent (chrysanthemum→constellation) and payoff at closure. Minor overwriting in one clause (“slow rotation of stars through its cracked dome”) is forgiven because it teaches the pattern that later reweights.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line economy is severe: “cards whispering like secrets” carries three jobs—sound, texture, Vera’s projection. No paraphrase loops; each measurement datum advances either catalog or relationship. Opening sentence anchors voice, stake, and milieu in 24 words. Final line—“the onyx cards whispered their secrets to anyone patient enough to listen”—reverses opener’s cynicism into earned poise, cost legible in the qualifier “patient.”

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty: “light and memory merging into something neither science nor magic could fully explain” compresses concept and stakes. No loops or scaffold; modifiers are sparse and precise (“dying twilight,” “empty-eyed”). Metaphors stay internally coherent—prism fractures nostalgia into spectral components. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; final line is image, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent—shadow → water → guardian—without mixed logic. Information density high: one line can stage, evoke, and advance (“The shadow pooled beneath a lattice containing a child's hope, the simple wish to see an ocean”). Zero loops or scaffold; opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences do two jobs (action + metaphor or sensory pin). Occasional adjectival stacks (“quietly vivid,” “shimmering stillness”) flirt with purple but are justified by the chameleon motif. No paraphrase loops; every paragraph advances frame, stance, or atmosphere. Final line lands clean, no filter verbs dilute the image—only the vial’s star-glint and the word “free.”

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long anesthetic sentences contract into clipped flight beats. High information density—“closure seeker, traveling to families broken by loss” compresses mother’s career in one vivid line. No mixed metaphors; frosted hourglass and meteor hush coexist. One minor scaffold: “the surgery was supposed to...” clause repeats cadence twice, but occurs early, not in closure third.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line craft is dense and propulsive: “Seeds of feeling pressed into fertile shadow” does double metaphoric and thematic work. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“luminous jungle,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by Vera’s cerebral sensorium. One near-simultaneity slip (“She opened her eyes...and though there was no power...she felt the machine accept”) keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences carry double duty (“creativity trapped like birds in amber”). Occasional stacked modifiers (“shadowed rapture of the aurora’s embrace”) flirt with purple but serve the lyric pulse; no loops or scaffold detected. Final rust image lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence music is strong—varied openings, no scaffold loops—but figurative density borders purple in clusters: "fractured lullaby," "quantum containers," "probability itself." Mixed metaphors stay internally consistent (clocks/flowers/time), yet the accumulation drags immediacy in the folding beat. Minor paraphrase echo: "walked the freight lines / walked the phosphorescent ridge." Otherwise high density and clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences and hard cadence breaks, matching wind-music motif. High information density: one line can world-build, characterize, and foreshadow (“Each species of mechanical flora produced its own voice.”). No filter-verb stacks or synonym loops; metaphor vehicles stay physically coherent. Minor scaffolding: “seventeen years” is off-page summary, but it’s compressed in opener and never repeated. Closure line is taut and image-only.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud ear is musical yet propulsive; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with ascent/descent. Information density is high: “star-shaped impression that glimmered and faded like a promise half-remembered” does image + theme + stakes in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. Copy is clean; no typos or homophones. Only a single near-repeat of “gently persistent” keeps it from 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Density is high: one sentence slips frost, veins, piano, and generational loss into a single image. No loops; metaphor vehicles stay consistent—snow as bruise, silence as consumption. The only micro-slip is “seraphically mundane,” a coinage that risks preciousness, yet its very awkwardness fits a world where faces are wiped of expression.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and information. No loops or scaffold. Mixed metaphors (“mourning veil draped over forgotten centuries”) stay coherent because the veil is the shadow, not an add-on. Peak beat—the rune sinking—uses monosyllabic verbs to accelerate, then closes on the hush of “drifting down.”

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud ear is varied: long anacrusis sentences crash into staccato taps, mirroring wave pulses. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new layer (data, memory, corrosion). Metaphors stay physically coherent—“ocean had been taught to avoid its own wounds.” Information density peaks in the single line “toxins leaching upward in plumes invisible to satellites,” doing world-building, plot twist, and sensory cue simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: tidal cadence during hum, short declarative at dawn. No figurative muddle; metaphors (starlight rain, silver mantle) extend rather than contradict. Information density is high—each sentence layers setting, body, and concept without scaffold. Minor paraphrase loop “beautiful terrible mess” appears once but does not touch closure, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, high density: every sentence layers geology, politics, and botany; opener anchors voice and stakes, final line crystallizes forward motion; metaphors (glass→powder) obey volcanic physics, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence variety propels without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—tide receding for panic—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “both she and the orchids were survivors…both required specific conditions” (−0.2). Information density high; single sentences fold time, body, tool. Closure image “seedlings waited in their careful rows” is crisp, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm: varied sentence openings, no template cadence; only two instances of “she” opener in sequence, justified by urgent action. Information density high—one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work: “Dust motes swirled through beams of fractured light that fell through salt-crusted windows, illuminating shelves that curved with the tower’s wall.” Metaphors stay coherent (salt-lace hinges, nervous-system silk) and physically grounded. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold hedges. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image, not moral. Copy clean—no typos, tense drift, or pronoun ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: one sentence can anchor time, body, and metaphor (“She knelt...centuries of desert gales had etched into stone”). Figurative control holds in peak beat—no mixed metaphors when ink is simultaneously consumed by invisible fire and holding faces. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or image. Minor over-modulation (“serene and patient as a glacier”) is earned by voice scale and stays singular.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clean, high-density: “snow accumulated… pressing against her eardrums” does two jobs. No loops, no mixed metaphor. Rhythm varies: compound opening, then fragment “She felt awake.” Register stays within POV lexicon. Minor hedge: “dangerous liaison letter” feels slightly canned; could compress to “incriminating letter” without loss. Otherwise line-craft publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm: long breathy sentences for dome calm, short clauses for intrusion. Information dense—one line can set, sense, and symbol: “weight released, descent chosen.” No mixed metaphors; ballast-to-seed logic stays physical and moral. Minor scaffold: “the practice centered her, weaving continuity…” could compress, but it does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “splinter working its way toward her heart” does triple metaphorical, tactile, and stakes work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Mixed metaphors are functional—feral lullaby, mother wolf—because the frame is mythic. One register spike (“conceptual repricing” in narrative tag) is forgiven because closure beat is emotional, not academic.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “orbits of regret mapped in burgundy ink” does character, theme, and image in one stroke. No synonym loops; “observatory” never repeated mechanically. Metaphors are coherent—copper dome as forgotten crown, cities like circuits. Final sentence avoids drumbeat by varying clause length. One minor scaffold: “she decided” could be cut, but it occurs mid-story, not in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose carries high density: “constellation of her own design… each envelope a point of light” compresses setting, motive, and action into one clause. Mixed-metaphor risk is limited because all vehicles (fold, smoke, firmware) orbit the same resonance/translation conceit. One minor loop: “the amber had arrived… When Vera had opened” repeats “had” in adjacent lines, but the cadence is purposeful past-perfect framing. Final image lands clean with no artifactual overlay; rhythm breathes out on the last sentence to match the release.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work—e.g., “tile flake…felt its weight, its wrongness.” No synonym loops or template cadence; varied sentence openings. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay acoustic/artistic. Momentum breathes—compresses transit between mandala layers without stall. Final line earns rhythmic payoff by echoing earlier “silence as invitation” with added charge.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Information density high: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work. Metaphors (“sky into a fractured dome”) extend world logic without self-contradiction. No paraphrase loops, no template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally. Final line lands with propulsive ellipsis, recharging “warm light…cold absence.” Micro-scaffold: “the stone remained” repeats concept already implicit, but occurs early and does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and lyrical yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (crimson applause never clashes with indigo despair). Minor register lift in “crystallized final moment” feels earned by ghost’s theatrical idiom. Final line achieves charged cadence without syntactic fuss.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “She hadn’t believed… correlation did not imply causation” compresses backstory and character in nine words. Figurative language is sparse but precise: “layers of brilliant complexity” mirrors mica and mind without mixed metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances prop, body cue, or emotional calculus. Final line achieves luminous lift without purple swell—monosyllabic punch landing on “find you.”

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    High-density lines (“fossilized joys, the transitional objects that civilizations had left behind”) layer job without purple overload. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; every paragraph advances knowledge or image. Metaphors consistent (map, breath, letter) and physically coherent. One hairline slip—“emotions of creatures she had no name for” edges toward label—keeps from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud cadence is fluid; figurative language dense but patterned (amber, fossil, constellation) so never muddled. One paraphrase loop: “She began cataloging…with methodical patience…By cataloging them…” −0.2. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening line (“had not heard a human voice…”) hooks voice and mystery instantly; final line (“Ready to become tomorrow”) lands clean, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence variety and winter-hard consonants propel descent; no scaffold loops. Metaphors are spare and integrated (“silver tide,” “map of the fire”). One mixed image: “earth beginning its slow lean into warmth” personifies orbital mechanics, but the lyric pattern is taught early and repaid at closure. Information density high; each paragraph advances knowledge or terrain. Clean copy; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either sensory data or metaphor. High density: “lantern’s glow seemed to exist in its own small universe” does scene + mood + foreshadow in one stroke. Metaphors are coherent—fog as wool, water as hunger, needle as mend/curse—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates with crossing pace; no template cadence. Opening and closing lines are charged and specific. No filter-verb stacks; concrete nouns dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm is varied, read-aloud clean; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors stay coherent—“gray ribbons pressed to glass” sustains visual logic. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual data. Only minor scaffold: “She set down her pack… breathed. The air here tasted…” could compress, but momentum never stalls and closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; most sentences perform double duty (e.g., “moonlight turned the water into hammered silver” feeds both harbor and emotional state). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; “missing tooth” simile is brief, apt, character-specific. Filter verbs are minimal and justified. Register never drifts into workshop euphony; nouns stay concrete, verbs muscular. Final line cadence re-echoes opening petal-fall, closing the musical arc.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene temperature: short percussive clauses for descent, elongation for creature arrival. Metaphors are precise (isolation “calcified… like salt crusts”) and non-muddled. Information density is high—sentence 1 shelves setting, character, and stakes. No loops, filler, or scaffold detected; the single “time is not a cage” aphorism is warranted as remembered dialogue rather than narrator intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences advance story, image, and theme (“prismatic quiet… scattered… across the lily pads”). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent and local—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm accelerates at release then quiets into closure. Minor filter verbs (“she understood”) are voice-motivated and paid off within two lines.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences weld world, stake, and tool (“Frankenstein creation… stolen lab equipment”). Rhythm breathes—long cuff of exposition, then staccato beats under broadcast hum. Zero loops; no mixed metaphors; “ghosting across the screen” is precise, not purple. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts carry visual urgency. Copy-clean.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often performs atmosphere, motion, and backstory (“She moved through the rubble… malicious intent”). Zero loops or scaffold; metaphors are spare and coherent. Rhythm breathes—long organ chord sentence vs staccato crawl.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    No loops, no synonym churn; each sentence carries dual duty—e.g., “black water reflected nothing but gray sky” paints setting and states her cognitive limit. Metaphors are sparse, coherent: tombstones, architecture, brick—motifs that repay at close. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “furrowed hush”. Proofing clean; no simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, high-density; every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Sensory verbs are strong—“glass groaned,” “nail warmed”—avoiding filter-verb stacks. One minor scaffold: “the expression she’d perfected during grant applications” could compress to “her grant-application smile,” but the rhythm breathes naturally. Closure line is crystalline, undiluted by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean-lush: each sentence advances image or decision; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (light as chemical developer, map as negative). One mixed vehicle—“architecture of her life”—is minor. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive. Filter-verb count low; only two “seemed” constructions, both justified by her wondering stance. Rhythm breathes with ascent, no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information ratio: single sentences fold time-jump, backstory, and metaphor ("he had taught himself a polished calm…") without scaffolding. Figurative language is spare and keeps physical logic; no synonym loops or cadence templates. Occasional elevated note ("icons," "pilgrim") fits thematic elevation without register drift; closure line is lean and image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; figurative language is selective, never stacked in the high-pressure beat. One scaffold loop—“she wrote about… she wrote about…”—slows the penultimate paragraph; otherwise density is high and momentum clean.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean and propulsive: “vines erupted upward, black and thorned” does three jobs—action, color, danger—in six words. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. A single mixed metaphor (“wind tearing at her cloak” while she is already inside the vine-path) barely grazes clarity; otherwise rhythm breathes with the ascent and lands a clean final line.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud ear varied; sentence lengths contract during hedge eruption to mimic speed. Information density high—e.g., “Stars aligned decades ahead of schedule, and the eclipsed covenant…shattered” world-builds in one line. Two mixed-metaphor risks—“color of bruises and promises” and “door made of overlapping shadows”—but both pay off thematically. Minor loop: “roots…roots” repetition in paragraph 11; not at closure, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“darkness pooling in his eye sockets”—never stacked. Information density is high: each sentence advances stakes, image, or causality. Ash crumble and smile land without prose clutter; no scaffolding obscures the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence variety propels: opening long image, staccato reflective fragments, climactic parallel “After the applause…”; only minor scaffold—“He turned the cloth over, confidently uncertain…” re-states prior beat—kept from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is fluid, figurative but not purple; density is high. Minor loop: “tidal atrium’s waters began their afternoon rise… she adjusted her stance with the unconscious grace of long practice” repeats the tide-adjustment idea within four lines. No metaphor clash; closing image is crisp. Gate for 9+ fails because the loop touches the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose propels: varied sentence lengths, strong verbs, minimal filters. One paraphrase loop (“words…words” in paragraph 7) and one stock phrase (“throat tightened”) are minor scaffolds. No mixed metaphors; figurative language serves refraction motif. Clean copy, precise punctuation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—ivy like green water, bellows like wounded breath—no mixed metaphors. High information density: one sentence often performs scene-setting, character memory, and thematic hint simultaneously. One near-loop: “she’d failed to account for the undertow…she’d failed to account for the undertow in Daniel’s eyes” is a deliberate echo, forgiven because it reweights stakes immediately before boarding.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence variety is high; no template cadence. Information density strong—“propagation delays” is unpacked by immediate sensory consequence (light words arrive faster). Metaphors stay coherent: reversed watch ≈ reversed grief. One paraphrase loop: “reverse and restart” repeated three times in two sentences—acceptably pattern-teaching but still a trace artifact. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty (image, pressure, world rule) with high density; only two mild scaffold phrases (“like a living thing”, “waiting for someone to disturb them”) but they echo fern patience, forgiven. Metaphors are coherent—velvet as ear, ice as constellation—and paid off. No synonym loops or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into one-run sentence at violin burst; paragraph cut test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.3)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: no loops, no filler, every sentence advances image or stake. Opening line anchors vocation and metaphysics in one stroke; final line recharges “radiant hush” as lived condition. Metaphors are continent-wide yet accurate—“veins of living light”—and never repeat. Information density is surgical: one clause can span years (“styled hair she had once braided during thunderstorms”) without losing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, stakes, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“vineyard hush” introduced early and reprised). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and resonance: “perpetual twilight” vs. “cycle continued.” Grammar clean; spatial choreography tracks body, pin, and cloud layer without slip. No overwriting; high density without padding.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences multi-task: “The structure groaned against the coastal wind, its whitewashed walls catching the first amber light while shadows still pooled in the corners” sets scene, tone, and temporal hinge in one blow. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles coherent (wind-chimes as choir, emptiness as workspace). Opening and closing lines read-aloud cadenced—first light split, final chime hush. Only micro-slip: “sincerely insincere” appears twice; second use could be trimmed, but repetition serves pattern recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence layers image and information (“rings spread outward, silver-bright under the stars, each circle carrying encoded meaning”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into the trance beat, then exhales into the final bow. Opening and closing lines book-end the wave motif cleanly. Only hairline repetition of “stone” three times in closing paragraph keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is selective (“brilliant dimness”) and never clutters high-pressure beats. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety propels ascent-then-rest rhythm. Minor filter verb (“she felt nothing”) is voice-motivated and immediately grounded in bodily context.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors descent-to-revelation arc: long, accumulating clauses tighten into short imagist bursts at vial release. Mixed metaphors avoided; “colors rose like smoke” stays coherent within synesthetic logic. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Opening line anchors voice and mystery simultaneously. Only minor hedge—“impossibly dry” could lose “impossibly”—but effect is purposeful, not slack. Closure image is uncluttered, letting final line resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphor vehicles (amber, coins, static) remain internally consistent. One scaffold loop: “pattern spoke… pattern taught… pattern spoke” within 60 words. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; final sentence glows without overwriting. Rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to the staccato reversed message, propelling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language sparse and precise—“sunset fractured through the ancient glass”—never stacked. Strong verbs: “scraping,” “shattered,” “crystallize.” Rhythm modulates: long sentence for climb, staccato for crystal birth. No register drift; astronomical and cartographic terms stay within POV lexicon. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image—“her scythe silent now.”

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud cadence varies: opening cumulative sentence mirrors frozen river, then tightens into procedural beats. Metaphors stay consistent—sound as liquid, silence as honey. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Minor density alert: “blue fire” + “gemstone river” in same sentence, but logic holds (light scattering). Closing line earns resonance without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “the reservoir had finally surrendered” packs hydrology + defeat in five words. Varied sentence cadence; no template churn. Figurative language sparse, precise—“like bones from ancient earth” reappears as CR. Zero paraphrase loops; opening and final lines bookend with wind & silence. No artifact within final third.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Figurative language is dense but patterned—prismatic spray, kaleidoscopic waterfall—taught early and paid off in final shimmer. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; sentences vary in length and opening. Scaffolding minimal; information density high. One paraphrase loop (“she had spent her entire career…”) could trim, yet momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Information density is high—“thermal anomalies matched volcanic precursors, but the pressure readings contradicted” packs stakes, data, conflict into one line. Mixed metaphor check clean: cloud “shimmered gold and pink” is single coherent image. Only minor scaffold: “patterns emerged … patterns refused to resolve” is deliberate recursion, not loop. Closure line “waited for the patterns to speak again” lands with crisp propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with beats: storm-born silence / seed smell / water language—no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are precise and non-contradictory; “pregnant with possibility” is earned by the seed’s literal biology. Information density is high—each sentence advances premise or stakes. Minor scaffold: “innovators, dreamers, and those who refused to let the world grow static” is a touch list-like, but it compresses world-building efficiently and does not recur.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances grief or sound. Figurative language is selective—“tunnel like a throat that had forgotten how to swallow” sets stakes immediately and is never repeated. High information density: “salt to the sound” does double duty as sensory detail and metaphor for tears. No mixed metaphors; physical logic holds (sound vibrating photographs is impossible but internally cued). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long hypotonic lines for suspended years, clipped fragments when Maren moves. Metaphors are spare and consistent—garden as sleeping beast, pendant as false star—no mixed vehicles. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or decision. Opening line anchors voice and metaphor; final line crystallizes the new equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is compressed forge-work: every sentence layers job—temperature, theology, family, politics—without filler. Metaphors are coherent metal-work vocabulary (unknit, bloom, sever) that never contradict physics. Rhythm accelerates with approximation beats, then cools into the final declarative walk toward dawn. Zero loops, scaffold, or paraphrase; even abstract nouns are tethered to sensory hook (hope as “heavy,” destiny as “pattern”).

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Metaphors are internally coherent—“gorge yawned like a mouth that had forgotten how to close” sets the silence motif without mixed vehicle clash. Zero loops, no synonym churn; scaffold-free. Opening and final lines are sharp, propulsive. A single near-purple phrase “serenely electric” is pattern-taught early and pays off, forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere); no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (net, static, starlight) and do not crowd high-pressure beat. One template cadence run: three “The ___” openers in close succession (−0.2). Opening and closing lines are sharp, propulsive. Information density high; paragraph cuts clean. Minor proof blemish—“businesssman” typo—does not dull closure. Overall clean enough for immediate print, minor copy-edit only.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence adds tactile or perceptual information. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no synonym churn. One minor scaffold: “reasonably imaginary in every detail except depth” restates prior beat. Final paragraph earns its lyric lift through prior pattern of thread, fever, negotiation; no drumbeat cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence either advances knowledge or image. Metaphor density high but taught early—‘cathedral of shadows’—and paid off in dome reveal. No mixed vehicles; volcanic stone & coral remain coherent. Information density: one line can anchor setting, mood, and thematic tilt simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely free of scaffold; information density is high with simultaneous scene-work and world-texture. Metaphors (“fog pooled like spilled milk”) are apt and non-competing. One paraphrase loop—“pulse—irregular, hesitant, but present”—is minor. No artifacts touch the closure beat; final line lands with crisp image. Minor filter-verb clustering in early expository lines holds score just under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: one line carries setting, metaphor, and emotional charge—“the crashing hush of the deep pressed against her suit, that particular silence that wasn’t silence at all but the weight of an ocean holding its breath.” No looped stems, no mixed metaphors. One near-artifact: “water moved through phase transitions of its own down here” skirts editorializing, but the scientific frame justifies the conceit and it pays off in the codex image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is dense and purposeful; metaphor vehicles (opal, ink constellation, lantern) stay internally consistent. Only minor scaffold: “refracted light in strange ways” is vague filler amid otherwise precise optics. No loops, no register drift. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final release, mirroring the cessation of counting.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (e.g., “She raised the flawed diamond and studied the birds through its fractured heart” advances action, motif, and visual in one stroke). Metaphors stay coherent—copper as circuitry, birds as alphabet—no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with emotional beats; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Only micro-slip: “quietly articulate voice” used twice; the repetition is distance-distant but not closure-touching.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence openings pivot away from repeated stems. Information-dense lines (“Samuel hadn’t encountered… Samuel had become it”) compress backstory without stall. One mixed-metaphor watchspot: “turning himself inside out to spite a cosmos” skirts edge but fits POV’s dramatic idiom. Minor scaffold: “she understood then” could be tighter, yet no loops obscure closure. Metaphor coherence maintained; no artifact touches final image.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose density is high—lines simultaneously advance atmosphere, stakes, and tactile detail: “apple blossoms began falling upward” performs image, theme, and causal result. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to staccato heartbeat triplets without drumbeat monotony. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the last rather than repeating. Only the single “manicured hell” cliché prevents a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: single sentences often do triple duty (anchor, mood, world-rule). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent—“lightning like dying fireflies” sustains the bottled-death conceit. One mixed image: “bending every rule until they hummed” is sonically pleasing but physically vague, a hairline slip. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested and propulsive; paragraph cuts are purposeful, each advancing knowledge or charge.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the scene: long sentences for dusk stillness, fragments for broken notes. Figurative language is sparse and tied to craft—“nail driven into silence” is apt, not ornamental. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances image or choice. One mixed moment: “misting hush that rose from cooling metal” risks atmospheric cliché, but the next sentence grounds it in Marcus’s skin temperature, restoring specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high-density lines (“poems existed not as printed words but as grooves pressed into wax cylinders”). One paraphrase loop: “she stayed because…she stayed” in adjacent clauses costs −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent; no artifacts touch closure. Slight upgrade for tactile specificity that advances story while evoking atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long, tide-like sentences to the staccato “She pressed the shutter.” Figurative language is sparse but purposeful—“a sudden blade of gold”—never clustering into purple. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, motive, or atmosphere. Copy is clean; no scaffold or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies without template cadence; information density high—each sentence advances image or emotion; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; minor scaffold in “shadowed nexus under starlight” repeated descriptor but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is fat-free: simultaneous world-building, character, and mood in single phrases—“fruit that shimmered with hues that had no names in his language.” Metaphors stay orchard-bound, internally consistent; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes with escalating sentence fragmentation under emotional peaks. One minor loop: “colors that had never existed before” slightly repeats “colors no living eye had seen,” but it occurs early and does not blunt closure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; short sentences under starlight, longer coils inside the net’s secrets. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—starlight as “quiet wounds” teaches the pattern of light-as-injury that culminates in the final ray catching the needle. No mixed metaphors or loops; each image advances either atmosphere or knowledge. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stake without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong sentence variety and sensory density; no filter-verb clusters or scaffold loops. Mixed metaphors are avoided—“rain had been working…” sustains single vehicle. One paraphrase loop: “never been consecrated, never held a congregation, never known anything but silence” reads deliberate litany rather than accidental padding. Otherwise information-dense and propulsive to the whisper close.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with depth changes: long sentences for descent, staccato fragments for the globe retrieval. Information density is high—“books had become coral and knowledge had transmuted into calcium deposits” does triple world/character/time work. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; vehicles stay maritime. Minor paraphrase loop at“she thought of…” repeated three times; does not touch closure but keeps this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero scaffold loops; each sentence either compresses time (“She had spent weeks…”) or advances sensory knowledge. Figurative layer is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, every image (bolt plate = monastery, graffiti = petals) returns to the preservation motif. High information density: “the ghost began to dissolve—not disappearing, but dispersing into something larger” performs three jobs (visual, emotional, conceptual) in twelve words. Final line earns its brevity by echoing the opening “Few had ever heard her sing,” now recontextualized as voluntary silence.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences do double duty: “amber lenses catching the strange light” simultaneously anchor object, sensory detail, and foreshadow decryption. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs—groaned, clutched, scattered—propel. One metaphor string frozen→prisms→rainbows is patterned early and repaid at release, avoiding purple overload. Final line offers echo-loop of “ascending servant” without paraphrase, earning cadence payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence openings vary from participial to noun-driven, avoiding template cadence. Metaphors are tactile, never mixed: “landscapes of texture,” “constellations filtered through calculated starlight.” Information density is high—one sentence often layers time, texture, and thematic hint. A single paraphrase loop—“the tree stood condemned, its rings of knowledge awaiting erasure”—is forgivable at closure and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from long breathless accumulations to fragment bursts under pressure; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layer is spare—only two metaphors across climax—hence no muddle. Opening and final lines re-echo “starlings” and “notes,” creating clean ring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is lyrically controlled: long sentences bloom in calm beats, then fragment under the note’s resonance (“What emerged was not smoke or light but sound”). Information density is high—each sentence layers image, memory, and concept without scaffold. One paraphrase loop (“mirrors were hauntingly bright… mirrors shifted, showing…” within 40 words) triggers a −0.2; otherwise metaphors stay coherent. No artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping 9+ eligibility intact.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lines are dense but uncluttered: “fog drifted like breath” is the only adverbial simile in the first 200 words. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence adds new causal detail (soil check, bell chime, moth descent). Opening sentence anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves with image—bell chime as heartbeat. Metaphors stay internally consistent; arches cradle, mist breathes, chalk glows—no mixed vehicles. Tense and aspect remain stable across the single dawn-to-dawn window.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new information or sensory layer. Figurative language is disciplined—one commanding metaphor per beat, no purple pile-ons. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges the beam/puppet pairing. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence rises and falls with her physical effort, no mechanical template rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances mark, frost, or birds. Metaphors (“copper warnings,” “graceless beauty”) are spare, mixed-modality, and paid off. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly. Sentence variety accelerates ascent: short beats for frost risk, longer for memory. No scaffolding, no synonym churn. Information density high—“groundwater… made the nuts bitter and strange” does world, curse, and metaphor in one stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, knowledge, or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and physics-true (“foam traced white lines across dark water”). High information density: the chrysalis-handling beat simultaneously reveals memory, metaphor, and future polymer geometry. Final paragraph’s cadence slows to match the earned exhale without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: moonlight bottle trades for prison poems, bracelet pulses arithmetic, child carries missing pages—each sentence layers world, backstory, stakes. Metaphors stay internally consistent (glass, light, fragmentation) without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm accelerates at child’s entrance, then releases into resonant final line that recharges “clean slate” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density: “rain had stopped three hours ago” packs time, smell, backstory. Varied sentence rhythm; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent—coral growth = memory accretion; no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances knowledge or image. Copy-clean except single hyphen instead of em-dash in dialogue, negligible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “Khoisan languages produced overtones that seemed to make the structures sing” packs ethno-linguistic, acoustic, and anthropomorphic data into one clause. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds either new language, new frequency, or new social corollary. Metaphors stay coherent—wind-through-wheat, distant church bells—anchored in agricultural and ecclesiastical contexts the town already owns. Only micro-slip: “vigorous, purposeful strokes” borders on template gesture, but the adverbs are earned by Elena’s habitual decisiveness, so the artifact does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    High metaphor density is patterned and accretive, not ornamental—each light/reflection metaphor feeds the final mirror-gleam image. No mixed metaphors or register drift. One paraphrase loop ("abandoned dreams... dreams that had been abandoned") but it occurs in low-pressure exposition and does not touch closure. Otherwise clean, vivid, information-dense lines that advance atmosphere or character.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; sentences carry double duty (description + insight). Figurative language is selective—no stacked metaphors clutter high-pressure beats. Minor scaffold: “seeds” metaphor is repeated but serves pattern cohesion, not padding. Opening and final lines anchor voice and re-charge motif, satisfying read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose carries high information density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“music bloomed inside her bones”). Rhythm modulates without algorithmic pattern; no filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent under physical logic. One minor scaffold—“silence had come…silence remained”—is purposeful echo, not redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: each sentence advances image or interiority; figurative language is selective ("sky in bruised violets"). Minor scaffold: two adjacent "she had…" anaphoras could be trimmed but do not stall propulsion. No mixed metaphors or therapy-speak; opening and closing lines are resonant and varied. Clean grammar, tactile verbs, no synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but breathable—each sentence advances image or stakes: “the silence of hospitals at three in the morning” packs backstory without exposition. One paraphrase loop (“silence that exists…silence that exists”) is minor. Metaphors stay coherent within sonic/wave logic; no mixed vehicles. Final line lands with punch-rhythm: “love was simply attention sustained over time.”

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence variety strong; openings avoid template cadence. Occasional micro-loop: “breathed in before breathing out” and “serenity within motion” echo twice; not fatal but slightly dilutes freshness. Metaphors mostly coherent, though “frozen dancers” edges toward mixed logic. No scaffold sentences or paraphrase stacks. Copy clean; pronouns unambiguous. Read-aloud rhythm supports contemplative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances current, setting, or cost. Figurative control: “whirling silence” is oxymoron that teaches the pre-inversion hush without mixed metaphor. Information density high—e.g., “underground rivers…mapping paths no compass could predict” delivers world rule + character method in one stroke. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into inversion, then slows for landing, mirroring plot pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; figurative language (“metal heart,” “city wake”) is sparse and patterned early so closure retains clarity. No loops, scaffold, or register drift detected. Occasional adjective pairs (“hazy precision”) are voice-motivated and paid off in final line.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers new sensory or causal information. Metaphors are internally coherent (frozen congregants, acoustic marble) and never mixed. High information density: one line can anchor space, body, and stake (“She was a prism-song bell ringer...”). Final third is artifact-free; closure image is crystal-clear. Only micro-tick: occasional adjective triplets (“green and violet and impossible gold”) but they read as synesthetic overflow, not purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and world-logic payload. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Metaphors stay coherent (veil as permeable membrane, song as weave). Minor scaffold: “She returned the gilded reed flute to its case, closed the clasps, and began the long walk down” could compress to two actions, but rhythm serves descent pacing. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences carry double duty—world-build and interior math. Figurative language rarely overruns: only two consecutive metaphors in high-pressure zone (“loss multiplied… asymptote”), justified by narrator’s math-obsession. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or concept. Minor scaffold: “the mathematics resolved” echoes earlier “trying to understand the mathematics,” but repetition is thematic reprise, not churn. Closing line achieves Charged Poise with impeccable cadence—“pressing meaning into existence one transposed emotion at a time”—ending on stressed monosyllable like a press kiss.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent (“spine of ancient stone” holds vertebral illumination). High information density: one sentence often sets weather, body, and relic response. Zero scaffolding; each paragraph advances knowledge, intention, or emotional charge. Closure line is clean, propulsive, and undiluted.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet precise: “translucent pillars catching what little light dared penetrate” performs atmosphere and stakes in one breath. Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent—frost as map, prism as refraction of meaning. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new pressure or detail. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and ear-tested. Minor purple flourish in “crystalline skeleton” is earned by context and pattern-taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary from long, loom-like cadences to fragmentary flashes (“The amber bead pulsed once, brilliant, then settled…”), propelling the ritual. Figurative language is sparse outside the portal moment, preventing purple drift. Zero loops, no scaffold; every paragraph advances image, choice, or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely loop-free; “deliberate / deliberately” is a sanctioned echo motif. Sentence openings vary, information density high—one line can anchor time, tool, and emotional shift (“He relit his forge that night using core-heat…”). Mixed-metaphor risk is minimal; “cathedral of petrified wood” merges geology and sanctity without clashing. One minor scaffold: “It would take years. It would take everything.”—a rhythmic stall that could compress, but it lands mid-story and doesn’t dull the final azure strike.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density: “quantum stabilizers had failed here first, creating pockets where time folded” does world-building in one stroke. Rhythm varies—short sentence “The shard pulsed green” propels the turn. Metaphors consistent; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop detected: “abandoned...neither fully abandoned nor entirely forgotten” could compress. Otherwise clean, no scaffolds in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Figurative layer is spare—dust motes “like underwater creatures” is the single extended metaphor and it earns its keep by marrying sea to air. No filter-verb clusters; verbs are muscular—“she climbed,” “she rebuilt,” “she sealed.” Opening line is hook and anchor; final line is image that recharges the entire lattice. Copy-clean: no typos, tense drift, or pronoun wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (image + world rule). Two adjacent “as she always did” loops create minor scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Filter verbs minimal and motive-driven. One overwrought cluster (“symphony of thunder and joy”) slightly bruises climax. Otherwise clean, propulsive, high density.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold or loops; every sentence either advances knowledge or image. High density: “tethered to nothing but the ancient currents” does world, peril, and metaphor in nine words. Metaphors are coherent—light as memory extractor, wing as map—and never mixed. Rhythm breathes: the paragraph that ends with “blue fire” is a controlled crescendo that matches the heart-rate spike. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “She watched, breath held, as the bent brass straightened itself” shows action, object, and interiority in one sweep. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new information or sensory shift. Metaphors are spare and precise—“silver light streaming through the cracked window”—without stacked vehicles. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors dawn calm after storm, propelling closure without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; figurative language is selective, never crowding a single beat. One paraphrase loop—“memories scattered like seeds… fragments… beyond her grasp”—is minor; no mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: single sentences often set scene, reveal backstory, and advance emotion. Figurative control: “contradictions like lanterns” reappears to reward pattern. Minimal scaffold; only trace of churn is “she had…she had…” anaphora, but it mirrors obsessive memory and is therefore earned. No mixed metaphors or loops near closure; final paragraph breathes appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language sparse and precise—“ghost of its original sweetness,” “courtyard held its breath.” No mixed metaphors. Paragraph cuts are clean; each advances knowledge or emotional charge. Proofing clean: no typos, pronoun drift, or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical, each sentence advancing either image or stakes; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“quartz hush,” “luminous dust”) are few, consistent, and physically coherent. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, avoiding explanatory filler. One micro-flaw: “gentle chiming of ice crystals” appears twice; second instance could be cut, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: every sentence advances image, stake, or beat. Metaphors are fresh but coherent—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold detected: “narrow passages between vendor stalls” followed immediately by “narrow passages” again; minor. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“breathed,” “swung,” “slipped”) dominate. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reverb motif without overwriting. No artifacts in final third; closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: sensory verbs carry double duty (taste = knowledge). Varied sentence cadence avoids template. Minor scaffold: “tasted… taste” repetition in adjacent lines (−0.2). Metaphors stay coherent (aurora as question, ring as empty north). No purple pile-ups; closing copper image is concise and propulsive. Clean grammar and pronoun track.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong density: “charcoal-fingered hands trailing along walls that glowed with the pale violet light of dawn breaking through ice” does three jobs in one clause. No模板 cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor scaffold: “She would… She would…” final paragraph could be trimmed, but it does not touch the closure image. Mixed-metaphor check safe; crystalline imagery stays internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety is purposeful; parataxis speeds the tunnel crawl, while cumulative syntax slows for the reveal. No loops or synonym churn; each line advances knowledge or atmosphere. Metaphors are selective—“soap bubbles refusing to burst”—and physically coherent with the glass domes. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges the motif of gilded inscription as both memory and veil.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    No scaffolding or synonym loops; each sentence layers job—advancing action, texture, and theme. Figurative language is sparse and precise: “a lie rather than a truth” keeps the metaphysical stakes legible. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates with the rope pull, then settles into the final cadence of descent. Only hairline slip: “the color of wonder” risks abstraction, but the context grounds it in Maren’s vocational terror of gray practicality.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative control high—“magnetic auroras danced across the sky” arrives only after physics cue, avoiding purple. Information often dual-tasked: “peeling stickers of cartoon characters no one remembered” compresses time and cultural loss in one stroke. Final paragraph mirrors opening with altered valence, giving circular momentum without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clean, high-density; lines do two jobs (“stories accumulated like morning dew” sets tone + stakes). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay physical—colors bleeding, mailbox exhaling—so figurative layer integrates rather than obscures. Minor register lift in “calcified into ritual” is earned by Mrs. O’s diction.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    Highly dense lines carry atmosphere, plot, and theme simultaneously; near-zero scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing—“patience of forgotten things,” “encrypted her vulnerability as strength”—flirts with poetic overwrite but stays motivated by lyric mode. No mixed metaphors, no loops; final paragraph breathes without deflating. One paraphrase echo (“fear was not failure” restated) keeps it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: a single sentence often sets place, stakes, and metaphor—“The massive creature had washed ashore carrying something… a sphere of compressed light.” No paraphrase loops; “fluctuated mysteriously” is the only stem repeat and it’s minor. Metaphors are coherent: tide-master men / tide-master time. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “gleaming silence.” Micro-movements serve pressure—knees buckle under gravity—no puppet-master clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence music is deliberate—spondaic clusters (“stillness…spaces…stars”) mimic hush expanding. Information density high: one line often does three jobs (concrete image + world rule + emotional charge). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Minor over-alliteration in “softened by water but its form intact” is the only hairline slip preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: single sentences layer time-jump, sensory detail, and metaphor (“meteors measuring borrowed time”). Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances mythos or image. Figurative language sparse, pattern-taught: “building’s morning stretches” appears once and recurs only when narrator can literally hear them. Mixed metaphors avoided; “secret language” sustained throughout. No scaffold; opening omits back-story dump, instead embeds Elara’s death in second sentence. Copy-clean: pronoun “her” always antecedents Elara; “it” always seal or building. Final line’s monosyllabic cadence provides deliberate breath after lyric swell.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyrical but information-dense: single sentences advance glow, memory, and stakes simultaneously. No scaffold loops; the two “tragically radiant” repeats are the nearest to synonym churn but spaced enough to avoid artifact. Metaphors (“needles threading heaven to earth”) are coherent and brief. Final line cadence mirrors opening garden breath, earning echo. One tiny simultaneity slip: “she spoke through the night, through the slow rotation of constellations” compresses hours into a phrase, acceptable under lyric ellipsis taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold. Each sentence advances: “He pricked his thumb, letting a single drop of blood fall into the ink” does triple duty (ritual, embodiment, cost). Metaphors are precise: “guilt had calcified… like the mineral formations” sustains geological motif without strain. Rhythm mirrors heartbeat escalation then exhales into the final dust scatter. Closure image untouched by any artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm is deliberate: opening paragraph flows like an incantation, final paragraph fragments into silence. Figurative language is dense—echo as extraction, stars in rhythmic pulse—but pattern-taught early and paid off at closure. One scaffold paraphrase appears (“the canyon answered… the sound rippled outward… returning transformed”) where a tighter cut could merge clauses. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; momentum carries through 770 words without bogging.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, imagistic, high-density: “candle flames that painted the glacier walls in amber and shadow” does three jobs in eleven words. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay physically coherent. Minor cadence echo: “stepped through…waiting dark / stepped through” in last two paragraphs—intentional reverberation but verging on template. Does not obscure causality; closure image remains crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “water still dripped…rhythm she had learned to read like text” layers setting, character, and metaphor without flab. Figurative control is tight—light as “infinitesimal lanterns,” rain that “understood”—each image pays off in the closing paragraph. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. A single mixed metaphor (“conducting the fireflies like an orchestra”) is minor, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong propulsion—every paragraph advances knowledge or atmosphere. Only minor loops: “comfortable lie” is repeated twice with identical phrasing; “something cold settled…” is generic embodiment. Mixed metaphor “roots drinking deep from contaminated soil” is vivid and purposeful, not muddled. Closure beat is clean, uncluttered, sentence-varied—no artifacts touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: lightning-cobalt glass reflection does visual + tactile + symbolic work in one phrase. No synonym loops or scaffold; varied sentence openings. Figurative language patterned—weather as memory—coherent, not muddled. Final line “let the static sing” propels closure without overwriting. Minor −0.2 for two adjacent “had” pluperfect clusters mid-story; does not touch ending.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyrical but disciplined: high information density, strong verbs (“wore the driftwood smooth as bone”), and metaphor clusters that stay coherent. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“salt and rotting kelp, but also something sweeter”) and a couple of near-simultaneous participle openers, yet these never obstruct causality or dull the closure image; they keep the piece just outside flawless territory.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Information density high—one line often layers sensory data + emotional calculus. Figurative language is sparse and paid off (“mournful whales” echoed by bell’s release). Zero paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Copy is clean; pronoun references unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense but breathable: each sentence layers sensory data with emotional calculus. Metaphors (leviathan ribs, suspended river) are coherent and brief; no mixed chains. One scaffold echo—“patient revolution” repeated twice in closing paragraph—dims momentum slightly. Otherwise rhythm modulates, paragraphs vary, and no filter-verb clusters appear under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. High information density—“pharmaceutical logos, falsified destinations” does triple work. One paraphrase loop (“tunnel hadn’t been built by the transit authority. It was older…”) costs −0.2. No mixed metaphors; “history pressed against the present like a bruise” is precise and earned. Closure line is propulsive, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is loop-free, with high density: “dust motes danced through amber light and the only sounds were the whispered ticking of a hundred tiny mechanisms” performs atmosphere, stakes, and sonic motif in one sentence. Metaphors are coherent—clockwork heart, morning light, storm break—each reappears to pay off at closure. No synonym churn; “clockwork heart” never mutates into “mechanical organ” or similar. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for guilt, fragment-like beats for the repair prognosis. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm mutates with altitude: propulsive pre-launch fragments, then airy glide. Metaphors stay mechanically apt (no acid-purple clichés). No loops or synonym churn; each sentence adds torque or sensory bite. Information density high: brass hiss + history + character want in single line openings. Closure line is clean, artifact-free, sonic.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density via noun-verb pairs, minimal scaffold; a single near-loop (“numbers started appearing…”) and one stacked modifier string (“drunken karaoke from parties a decade past”) are forgivable. Simultaneity clean, sentence variety strong; patch and “stars above…like distant servers” land as earned final image, no mixed metaphor near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (action + image) with minimal scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“shadows rippling… like loyal hounds”—is purposeful and paid off. No filter-verb stacks, no loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“reverent,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the mythic register without register drift. Clean copy; pronouns track; final paragraph lands with cadence that re-illuminates prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often does setting, character, and metaphor work (“the ice would shift when it shifted”). No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Occasional elevated phrasing (“windborne solace”) fits lyric mode and is earned. Final paragraph breathes with short/long cadence match to dock motion.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: each sentence advances image or stakes; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors are sustained—lantern pavilion, arthritic vines—without mixed logic. Strong verbs: “copper light caught,” “twisted like arthritic hands.” No filter-verb stacks. Rhythm breathes between descriptive accumulation and terse dialogue. Opening line anchors voice and metaphor; final line resolves with charged image. Minor cadence repetition in “these vines… mismatched unions” but does not obscure closure. Proofing clean: names, tenses consistent. Meets 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; only one paraphrase loop (“the walker understood… she had walked…”) slows the middle. Figurative language is selective—obsidian mask, fire in eyes—never stacked. Final line “next dying song that needed saving” provides propulsive off-ramp without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “purple persistence against industrial gray” compresses history into image while advancing setting. No filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught early (“grief was a kind of cartography”), paying off in final mosaic. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; opening and final lines recharge motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences layer time, light, and memory (“seventeen years since the last dictionary”). Figurative language is spare and precise—“language grew like trees”—no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: “this was why she stayed / this was why she had refused” in adjacent sentences; minor. No scaffold; paragraph breaks mirror breathing beats. Opening and closing lines are image-based and propulsive. Read-aloud rhythm natural, cadence rises to final whisper.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “He followed these fragments the way a deaf man might follow vibrations” does double duty as metaphor and stakes clarification. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid density penalties. Opening and final lines are image-anchored, not abstract. A single paraphrase loop—“already unsure why he had arranged them, already feeling the vision slip”—is deliberate echo of theme, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: looping “never hurrying, never slowing” mirrors the hand’s motion, justifying the pattern. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds texture or advances image. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. Minor elevation—“perpetual mist,” “changelessly constant”—stays within lyric register and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “clouds drifting below like slow thoughts” performs metaphoric work without mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop—“he was terrified... still am”—is justified by emotional stutter. Rhythm accelerates into single-clause beats at the nurse’s arrival, then exhales, supporting momentum. No scaffolding, no register drift; diction stays within Mira’s lyrical lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly loop-free; only minor scaffold (“she had spent weeks learning to relearn”) repeats root ideas. Metaphors are spare and coherent—spoons “curling like dying leaves,” automaton “unfolding like a flower remembering spring”—no mixed vehicles. Information density is high: one sentence can layer world fact, character mood, and plot cue. Opening and closing lines carry ear-rhythm and thematic echo. A lone filter-verb cluster (“she knew,” “she understood”) is acceptable mid-reflection and does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long reflective sentences in garden twilight, then staccato dig, lift, decide. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“honey left too long in the sun” is the single simile and it sticks. Opening and closing lines are mirror-bookends that re-charge the maze as both path and prison.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with grotto acoustics—no template cadence. Information dense: one line relays age, climb difficulty, ritual repetition. Metaphors stay consistent (mist=dragon, glass=stars) and physically plausible. Minor scaffold: “the same kit she had used for thirty years” could be tighter, but does not obscure causality or dull closure. Final line cadence—“carrying fragments of light into the darkening world”—lands cleanly, no overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high information density: each sentence advances image or decision. Metaphors stay coherent—“emerald velvet,” “columns wrapped in ferns”—and align with garden palette. Minor scaffold: “something quieter: life reclaiming its territory” restates prior clause; one paraphrase loop, but outside closure beat. No strained vehicles or register drift; punctuation clean.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—“compressed whispers” does double sensory work. One mixed metaphor (“mist breathed… like something alive”) is earned by taught pattern. No scaffold loops; sentences open varied. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“she realized”). Final image crystallizes without overwriting. Minor paraphrase echo—“hope isn’t a destination / reaching mattered”—is thematically intentional, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often sets scene, advances plot, and carries metaphor (“pink light caught in copper bells”). Zero scaffold/loop; no mixed metaphors. Figurative language disappears in the climax, letting action breathe. Opening and closing sentences perform sonic book-end without felt contrivance. Clean copy, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm: paragraph breath matches ritual phases—long exhale for spiral, staccato for frost. Information density is high; one sentence often does three jobs: “The crater walls rose around her like cupped palms, sheltering this forgotten place from the winds that scoured the tundra above” anchors spatial, tactile, and metaphoric planes. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor is extended, not swapped. Figurative language peaks at the final silver-white flare, then vanishes—image, not explanation—so closure remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied and propulsive—long inhalation sentences build to short release clicks ("The timer began its measured countdown"). Information density is high: a single sentence often layers light-path, acoustic law, and emotional stakes. Figurative control is tight—no mixed metaphors, no filler filter verbs. One minor loop check: "preserving the preservation" edges toward paraphrase but is saved by its reflexive charge; it does not dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; sentences layer grief and geology in single strokes—“copper ore had oxidized into walls of living metal.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates at the final dawn lift without losing clarity. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and return recharged image.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: single sentence often layers sensory data, backstory shard, and micro-choice (“ash wood warmed in her palms, its grain tight and patient”). No paraphrase loops; each return of “here and gone” adds micro-shift of meaning. Metaphors lean but never mixed: e.g., “crystallized” time stays geological, never clashes with kettle steam. Only minor scaffold: “the way all things eventually become” could compress, but does not impede closure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; only one paraphrase loop (“perpetual motion”) and one stock phrase (“tumbled from the sky”) appear, neither in the final third. Strong verbs (churn, erode, dissolve) propel sentences. No mixed metaphors. Grammar clean; pronouns unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes: long reflective sentences accumulate texture, then tighten to telegraphic stubs at the turn (“Maya could do the same.”). No scaffold loops; information is dense—one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and interiority. Metaphors are coherent: vaulted ceiling → cathedral → stone patience. Minor overgrowth: “functionally creative decision” appears twice; deleting one instance would nudge this into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: “petrichor rose…transported her back” layers smell, time-slip, and motive in one line. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“glacial hush”) and reprised at closure without clutter. Template-cadence avoided; sentence openings vary. Micro-loop screen clean: no adjacent paraphrase, no filter-verb stacks. Tense and pronoun reference stable.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose density remains high—each sentence layers salvage motion with epistemic re-calibration, avoiding scaffold or paraphrase loops. Metaphors (“memory refusing to settle,” “hollow as promises”) are sparse, precise, and paid off in closure, so no coherence penalty applies. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses during twilight glide shorten into staccato retrieval beats, supporting propulsion without drum-beat monotony. Opening and final lines act as resonant brackets that recharge the sundial’s motif without ornamental overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean, image-rich, and largely loop-free; only minor scaffold appears (“snow continued falling…snow and silence and the faint impression”) in the coda, too late to blunt closure. Metaphors stay coherent (river deltas, lightning glass) and syntactic variety propels the slow reveal without purple intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence music is deliberate yet never algorithmic; parallelism serves ritual (“She wrote until…until…until…”) then fractures into the single-stroke final braid. Metaphors are concrete and internally consistent—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One near-artifact: “lonesome splendor” risks loftiness, but the prior eleven years of grounded specificity earn the elevated note.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm varies from long dream-sentence to staccato activation: “Light erupted… shell cracked.” No paraphrase loops; each metaphor (“palace hung like a frozen tear”) is singular and paid off. Information density high—feather-crystal-memory nodes compressed in one clause. One mixed metaphor risk: “bones of dead gods” beside “frozen tear” but consonant in scale. Closure image clean.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Metaphor density is high yet pattern-taught: every fire image is re-forged by lava → glass → sand progression, so no coherence break. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long clauses drift like clouds, then tighten to “She climbed the dune.” Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds temperature or texture information. Final line cadence—“carrying darkness toward the light she would make from it”—lands without syntactic flourish, letting image propulse.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; imagery is selective, not overwrought. No loops, filter-verb clusters, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“sidereal patience”) fits fairy-tale register without jarring. Information density is high; each paragraph advances stakes or image.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet musical; figurative layering (“colors that existed only in the spaces between stars”) is patterned early and paid off in the resonance release. No synonym loops or scaffold; one mixed metaphor (“pages of her consciousness”) is minor. Final sentence cadence mirrors opening, giving satisfying circular ear-feel.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: single sentence slips in greenhouse age, monarch migration timing, and family craft lineage. Metaphors are coherent—glass/tears, flight paths/roots—without mixed vehicles. One scaffold loop: “like rivers, like flight patterns, like the roots” could compress, but it lands at emotional crest and is forgiven. No filter-verb stacks; action verbs drive every clause.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is tidal, mirroring pendulum swing: long sentence / short sentence / caesura. No scaffold or synonym loops; each descriptor adds new sensory data. Metaphors are fresh—“blade of frozen night,” “shroud of shame thin enough to breathe through”—and physically coherent. Information density high: one sentence can anchor setting, backstory, and emotional state. Final line lands with sonic snap—“seventeen seconds resting lighter”—repetition of “seventeen” is purposeful callback, not filler.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “velveteen gloom,” “cathedral of stars,” “visual music” carry triple duty—image, tone, and thematic resonance—without crowding any single beat. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Metaphors stay coherent (tapestry = music = starlight) and do not contradict physical logic. Very minor lyric padding in the penultimate paragraph keeps it from 9.0, but momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: “speculation dressed in ink,” “questions dressed as possibilities” compress abstract idea into tactile image. Rhythm varies: long reflective sentences vs clipped “She did not pick it up. Not yet.” No scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors. Final line earns cadence release: “The future was still unwritten. She had simply made space for it to begin.”

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops. Opening “ember alcove glowed” and closing “banked, waiting” form a clean ring structure. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptually contraband”) stays within a copyist’s plausible lexicon and heightens the formal stakes of cultural loss. Minor over-adornment in “mist hung heavy as velvet” is the single decorative surplus, but it doesn’t occlude clarity or slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language (“each one a tiny universe suspended in grief”) is selective and purposeful. One scaffold echo—“the vanishing point itself” repeated near opening and close—feels intentional reprise rather than loop, but a slight overture of adjectival uplift (“impossible space,” “haunting and whole”) keeps it from flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: longer clauses for descent rumination, staccato single-sentence paragraphs for cache ritual. Information density is high—one sentence can layer tool, history, epistemic claim. Minor scaffold: “competing narratives” is repeated three times in 200 words without new inflection; still, it never muddies causality or clogs the final image. No mixed metaphors or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from languid cumulative loops to a staccato “Teach me.” Information density high: “expectantly resigned” compresses emotional paradox in two words. Figurative language is selective—one sustained autumn/voice metaphor—avoiding purple overload. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines serve as tonal bookends without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is loop-free, high density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, plot data. Figurative language abounds but obeys internal logic—moonlight as liquid knowledge, greenhouse as ribcage—no contradictory vehicles. Strong verbs (“pressed,” “pruned,” “bloomed”) minimize adverbs. Paragraph cuts map to beat shifts: arrival, clearing, planting, harvest, exit. Minor scaffold: two “something beautiful” iterations could condense, but they frame arc and echo mentor cue, so forgivable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often performs atmosphere, characterization, and causal linkage. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; figurative language is spare and storm-earned (“humming resolved into harmony”). The single risk—an extended metaphor of water through broken glass—pays off by foreshadowing the later electric flow, so the image is earned, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with changing parts of speech, propelling the accumulative design. Figurative layer is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. One paraphrase loop (“the simple act of noticing what others had stopped seeing”) is minor; it doesn’t touch closure. High density, zero scaffolding artifacts in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops, no scaffold; each sentence either advances knowledge or deepens image. Metaphors stay physically coherent ("coral claimed the marble" implies encrustation, not conquest). Varying sentence length mirrors pressure: long aqueous clauses collapse into clipped heart-beat fragments at the hand-off. Opening line anchors both voice and cosmic stakes; final line resolves to Charged Poise without sentimentality. Only micro-slippage: "absolute peace" flirts with abstraction, but is rescued by its embedding in luminous glass.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “chalk she’d made from grinding steps she’d already passed” does triple duty (world rule, resource, emotional recycling). No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (“universe clearing its throat”). Syntax varies: fragments used only at rupture beat for propulsion. Copy-clean except one comma splice that reads intentional for breathless ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates from languid moonlit clauses to the staccato “ping” sentence without drumbeat patterns. Figurative language is sparse and integrated—“smog pressed like a living thing” serves immediate tension; no mixed metaphors. Information density is high: one sentence often sets scene, stakes, and sensory cue. Zero paraphrase loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; “methodically hopeful” is used once and embodied thereafter. Opening and final lines act as frame and recharged motif, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “the throat of oblivion” does triple metaphoric work without purple drift. Only one scaffold pair detected—“distant memory” immediately followed by “memory unfiltered by water”—a micro-loop worth −0.2. Otherwise sentences perform two or three jobs (image + motion + metaphor). Opening and final lines are ear-tested; cadence accelerates into the laugh-beat then subsides with waterfall reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, largely scaffold-free; every sentence layers image with motive (“toolbox rattling against the hunger stone”). Mixed-metaphor watch passes: “the ocean holding its breath” and “fishing line cast into deeper waters” cohere under an angler/respiration motif. One paraphrase loop—“latent radiance, light that had always been present but never expressed”—costs a −0.2, preventing 8.3. Otherwise momentum breathes with scene tide.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. High density: “sound like dead leaves scraping against bone” does three jobs—simile, sensory, foreshadowing corpse-feeding. Metaphors stay coherent: mirrors as photographic traps, fear as nested second heart. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges motif. Minor elevation in register during advisor speech is motivation-justified.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Figurative density is high but patterned (fractal, spiral, echo) and justified by the prophet’s vocation; mixed-metaphor risk is avoided. One paraphrase loop (“wreckage… obstacle… wreckage”) costs −0.2; otherwise compression is strong. Rhythm breathes with the blue-hour fade; no scaffold sentences. Final line lands cleanly without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is clean: no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, strong verbs (“traced,” “squeezed,” “scraped”). Information density is high—each sentence layers map-memory, object-memory, and present stakes. Occasional adjective clusters (“heavy and golden, beautiful in a way that felt like a lie”) flirt with purple but serve the sunwashed dread tone, so allowed. Final image—“the city behind her grew smaller, a cluster of shells…”—offers crisp, resonant closure without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty—description fused to judgment (“ivy crawled like green fire frozen in time”). Figurative language is selective, never stacked in high-pressure beats. One minor loop: “comfortable fiction...comfortable work” (already penalized in Q2); otherwise zero scaffold or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “barnacles crusted the marble benches where lovers had once whispered promises they couldn't keep” does triple sensory/historical/job work. No loops or mixed metaphors; only minor scaffold (“she began...she began”) early on. Rhythm breathes with dive-surface cycle. Final sentence propels: “carrying her treasures home”—monosyllabic landing after latinate prior lines, ear-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is efficient, lyrical without purple drift; most sentences carry double duty (atmosphere + motive or object state). Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts land on hinge discoveries. No mixed metaphors, no template cadences, no scaffold sentences. Minor synonym clustering around “stillness/still” and “darkness/dark” but does not stall momentum; remains within tolerance for high band.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, with high information density: each crane fold, gem cut, or scent note advances grief or plan. One scaffold pair: “could almost hear her voice in the crystal’s resonance” immediately followed by the quoted “Mama” could compress, but clarity remains intact. No mixed metaphors or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “circuit breakers had tripped again, overloaded by her latest calculations” does triple duty (tech state, causality, time pressure). Metaphors are spare and coherent: clouds as “brain tissue contemplating nothing” sustains the observatory-as-mind frame without mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Only minor scaffold: two adjectives (“intangibly tangible”) could be one, but the oxymoron is voice-true and paid off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, with high information density: each sentence advances image or mechanism. No synonym loops or template cadences; metaphors (copper light, static whispers) are spare and coherent. Opening and closing lines are resonant and propulsive. Minor scaffold: “She understood then…” could be deleted, but it occupies only one clause and does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; no two sentences paraphrase. Density is high—single line “manufacturing false memories for clients who needed new pasts” world-builds economy and ethics simultaneously. Rhythm breathes with scene: long clauses during tide retreat, staccato fragments at confession. Metaphor vehicles stay physically coherent (stone swallowed, tide line as ledger). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes image without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “she had spent three weeks in that space between apology and forgiveness” compresses backstory and emotional stance. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. One scaffold risk: “neutral territory had been chosen precisely because...” is expository, but it’s early and brief. Final line—“wisdom often wore the face of someone we loved making choices we couldn't understand”—earns its lift through prior embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and dense: “the fog rolled in like old grief finding its way home” compresses time and emotion in one simile. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Metaphors stay physically coherent (compass needle “pointing nowhere” is literal and figurative). Minor rhythm repetition in “maybe tomorrow… maybe next month” is intentional cadence, not artifact. Closure line “toward whatever came next” lands with open-ear resonance, no hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: single sentences layer memory-scrape, chest weight, breadcrumb pursuit. Rhythm breathes—long reflective clauses tighten into staccato questions (“Who are you?”). No scaffold loops; each detail advances plot, setting, or interiority. Figurative language is sparse and coherent (algae as lie-detector light), avoiding mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines serve as thematic bookends without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—description advances transformation, metaphor extends mythic logic without clutter. No loops or synonym churn; “moonlight,” “smoke,” “ash” recur only when repurposed. One mixed-metaphor moment—“stars burn cold”—reads intentional to paradox theme. Information density high; every paragraph either escalates scent or body change. Clean grammar, strong verbs, zero scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify (participial, nominal, fragment) without algorithmic feel. Information density high—single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and mythic data. No mixed metaphors; “stars pressed close enough to wound” sustains physical logic. One scaffold spotted: “time sliding past her like she was made of glass” echoes earlier “moments slipping through fingers like water,” but the variance in vehicle (porcelain vs glass) is purposeful, not churn. No artifacts touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences layer jobs—“She lifted a photograph… shimmering patterns—grief… guilt”—simultaneously reveal object, emotion, and plot clue. Metaphors are coherent: liquid starfire extends tear → light → portal without mixed vehicle. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during tear-collection list, then breathes at final knot. No thesaurus churn; “crystalline,” “salt,” “shimmer” repeat with purpose. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “lightness” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses like surf: long planetary sentences crash against fragmentary jar openings. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent—obsidian ribbon, crushed fruit world—never muddling causality. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Final clause “tides, like philanthropists, give everything away” crystallizes prior diction without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Opening sentence is arresting and propulsive; final sentence re-casts “luminous” and “sparks” with new conceptual weight, satisfying the callback test. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence runs. One paraphrase loop mid-story (“the astronomer had discovered... the astronomer had been calmly inventive”) is minor enough to deduct only −0.1. Figurative language is spare but precise; no mixed metaphors. Copy is clean: no homophones, tense slips, or pronoun drift. Information density is high—every paragraph either advances conspiracy or reweights imagery.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Revolution-via-sundial-cipher is a fresh inflection on the familiar “castle conspiracy” template; the angle-code mechanic is specific, low-tech, and memorable. The lock-sentinel POV is an unusual vantage rarely centered in palace-intrigue plots. Transformation test passes: changing Maren’s occupation would break the causal logic (she alone controls every lock). Risk is present—quiet sabotage instead of sword-clash—but executed confidently rather than gimmicky. Score capped short of 9 because the core revelation (counterfeiting mint) is a standard tyrant trope given new trim, not wholesale reinvention.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long silk-like sentence opens, then staccato “She positioned the seventeenth stone.” Information density high: one sentence anchors rock sequence, nautilus math, and bioluminescent source. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors (“silk torn from dying stars”) remain consistent with light/texture logic. Closure line—“aurora sang…eels began to dance”—is sonically resolved without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from thunderous cumulative clauses to single-word imperatives, echoing storm tempo. Figurative control high: lightning as alphabets, rage distilled atmospheric. Scaffolding minimal; one paraphrase loop (“furiously tranquil”) but self-conscious oxymoron fits theme. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Closing line lands clean with rhythmic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong rhythmic control; no template cadence or synonym loops. Sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative language is spare and apt (“diplomatic mask cracking”). Filter verbs minimal; information density high. Minor micro-scaffold: “as she had been for seventeen minutes now” could tighten to “seventeen minutes already.”

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—“stars poured through the gaps like witnesses” compresses setting, symbolism, and stakes in five words. No filler loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Mixed metaphors are avoided; rust recurs in library, desk, regime as coherent through-line. Read-aloud rhythm varies: paragraph of short sentences mirrors crate-drop beat, earlier languid lines echo sorting motion under starlight.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: each sentence advances image, sound, or causality; no scaffold. Rhythm varies—long breath for arbor panorama, clipped for craft touchdown. Figurative mixes (clouds as “shores,” compasses as “flickering”) stay coherent within sky-navigation metaphor. Proofing clean; only micro-loop is “cloud-filtered twilight” echoing earlier cloud refs but it is purposeful callback, not churn.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid monotony. High density: tide, compass, lace, color all carry dual duty. No mixed metaphors; “cerulean regret” stays consistent. Zero loops or scaffold; no “-ly” adverb clusters. Final line lands on image that recharges prior motifs without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful (“drowned things slowly returning to dust”) and consistent with Mira’s worldview. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; even elevated diction (“iridescent,” “chitin”) fits her lexicon. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors “patient, unhurried change,” closing with earned cadence, not flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (e.g., “charcoal smudged her fingertips” implies handling + stakes). Rhythm varies effectively—staccato during tension, flowing at resolution. One paraphrase loop: “survival felt less like victory and more like a question mark” slightly redundant with later “scorched testament” phrasing. Figurative language is coherent (glass/frost/light motifs interlock), though “white fire” frost verges on mixed metaphor. No scaffold or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: every sentence advances character, setting, or theme (“vibration was touch, and touch was temperature, and temperature was data”). Figurative language is coherent—ice, glass, light motifs interlock without contradiction. Rhythm varies purposefully: staccato beats during work, flowing cadence in epiphany. No loops or scaffold; even repeated structures (“Strike, touch, translate”) serve pattern-teaching. Final line (“worth every moment of silence”) resonates without summarizing, closing the arc with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “saltwater pooled on his workbench” establishes setting, mood, and inciting incident). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/water motifs) and never muddled. One minor slip: “geometry bent like grief” risks abstraction, but is immediately grounded by “impossible spaces between the shelves.” Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly echoes the story’s cadence of release.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “gently persistent as water wearing stone” earns its metaphor through prior action. Sentence openings vary (“The terra-cotta arbor…”, “Mira rang…”, “They arrived…”), and paragraphs breathe with scene rhythm. One minor flaw: “impossible to ignore” slightly overstates the bell’s delicacy, creating faint dissonance. Otherwise, zero loops, high information density, and closure image (“hope would continue its patient work”) avoids abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“jasmine bloomed,” “breath patterns like halos”), but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“luminous threads, rising through the jasmine like prayers finally delivered”)—a slight figurative overload. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively. Final paragraph’s cadence beautifully resolves motif, though “sparks from an unseen fire” edges toward familiar metaphor. Clarity remains intact throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or concept (“paths could betray you,” “time was forgetting itself”). Figurative language is coherent—time as raw silk, bridges as cathedral—without muddle or purple excess. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create rhythm matching emotional beats. One minor redundancy (“woven into the fabric of time itself” echoes earlier textile imagery), but no loops or scaffold dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “elephants with matted fur, bears missing limbs” conveys decay economically. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during scout confrontation. One minor flaw: “staggering grace she didn’t feel” edges toward diagnostic phrasing, but is redeemed by immediate physical context. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.8)

Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Rhythm modulates precisely—slow immersion during descent, taut focus at the forge. Final paragraph’s cadence (“Some things… worth the pressure”) delivers closure with earned gravity, no purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “luminous disbelief,” “press her ear against destiny’s door,” “painting their dreams in silver” avoid purple excess by grounding metaphor in character worldview. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with scene rhythm. One minor slip: “quietly savvy in ways that had saved her life more than once” borders on label-speak, but it’s immediately validated by her reading of floral codes. No loops, no scaffold—every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “ice beginning to weep” conveys thaw and emotion; “rivers would flow again” implies geopolitical shift. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold.

Final line’s “absurdity and beauty of beginning again” earns its lyricism through concrete buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong verbs (“devoured,” “crumble”) and varied syntax. Information-rich lines (e.g., “spiral of calcium carbonate” doing double duty as object and metaphor). However, “phobias that had made her Hollywood's most paradoxical stunt double” leans into abstract label-speak, and the phrase “firmly adaptive” reads as unmotivated jargon. No fatal loops, but slight overwriting in the opening paragraph dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences vary in length and structure to mirror tension shifts.

    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “raindrops slide down the crystal walls in distorted magnificence” merges setting, object, and theme. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Mira walked,” “He sat,” “She understood”).

Final line (“That was enough. That had always been enough.”) echoes opening rhythm without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)

Figurative language is purposeful (“docking arms stretched like legs of a sleeping spider”) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “warm”/“icy” pairing in final third, but no loops, scaffolds, or syntactic monotony. Final line (“dreaming of sideways rivers…”) perfectly echoes opening imagery with earned weight.

    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “fault-tolerant, because absolute oracles shattered” conveys worldbuilding, character, and stakes in one clause. Figurative language is controlled—auroras as “grief wearing celebration’s clothes”—without muddle. Minor deduction for slight overuse of botanical/weather metaphors in mid-text, but none obscure causality or dull closure. Final paragraph’s cadence (“Some imperfections… Some silences…”) achieves earned lyricism without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)

Final line (“Maren carried the weight of an axis waiting to be restored”) crystallizes theme without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Zero paraphrase loops; syntactic variety creates rhythm (e.g., em-dash interruptions, periodic sentences). Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“minor chord of her abandoned spy career”). Closure line avoids purple prose, landing with quiet specificity. Minor artifact: one slightly elevated phrase (“familiar enigma of truth itself”) risks abstraction but is anchored by concrete context.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “ash gray, the hue of unraveled stillness” conveys color, origin, and theme in one phrase. Sentence openings vary (“Father Marcus pressed…”, “She knelt…”, “Marcus stepped…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching tension spikes.

Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic cadence—ascending, open, luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is vivid and precise (“dead leaves that scraped across the floor like whispered secrets”), though slightly dense in peak beats—three consecutive figurative descriptions during the drum sequence flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Strong verbs (“exhaled,” “enthrall,” “unwinding”) carry momentum. Final line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “green with verdigris, its brass surface pitted by years beneath the waves” does triple duty (image, history, emotion). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence (e.g., widow’s weeping isolated for impact).

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)

Figurative language is pattern-taught (observatory as “forgotten thought,” seashell as “ephemeral compass”) and pays off without muddle. Minor scaffold in “She would return tomorrow with a recorder… But she would also return…” slightly dilutes propulsion, but rhythm varies effectively overall.

    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “mist held its lotus-hearted ache” avoids purple excess by grounding metaphor in physical sensation (mist, ache). Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Minor artifact: “tanched” (likely typo for “tangled”) slightly jars, but doesn’t obscure meaning. Figurative coherence is masterful—coral, mist, smudged ink all refract the core theme without mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“dust motes danced through amber light,” “gears frozen mid-turn like a life caught between breaths”). Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught—light, music, and mechanics recur with evolving resonance. Minor overwriting in one peak beat (“melody like forgiveness finding its way home”) borders on explicit but is redeemed by its earned placement. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; rhythm varies naturally, and the final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic release.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “brass hull hissing where caustic waves licked the waterline” fuses setting, sound, and threat in one clause. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (kaleidoscope as decoder, arrow as focus). Final paragraph’s cadence accelerates then crystallizes: “The arrow tip gleamed. The kaleidoscope turned.” Minor deduction for slight over-compression in “mathematical hunger embedded in the workshop’s very foundations”—could breathe more—but closure remains razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “servers humming like mechanical ghosts,” “birthday songs, lullabies, drunken karaoke” layer sensory specificity with thematic weight. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with tension. One minor redundancy: “forgotten songs played on” appears twice, slightly dulling the final echo. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (shadows as chains → hounds; crystal as splinter → compass).

Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly echoes the lighthouse beam’s sweep.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “windborne solace,” “fold in patience,” “calving glaciers” all do thematic and atmospheric work.

No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; every line advances character, setting, or theme. Final sentence (“that was enough”) resolves with quiet propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “translucent walls catching the last copper light” does triple duty (setting, mood, foreshadowing). Figurative language is controlled—no purple excess—and rhythm varies purposefully. Minor flaw: “destined mismatches” borders on label-speak but is immediately grounded in vine grafting metaphor. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic resolution without scaffold or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “obsidian on the left side of her face,” “kinetic parapet churning sand and memory,” “whisperfield calm.” Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. One minor slip: “conjured clearings—spaces carved temporarily from reality” slightly over-explains, but immediately redeems itself through dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (“domes catching starlight while the world below remained shrouded”).

Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly resolves the rhythmic tension established at the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (“light like honey,” “clouds like slow thoughts”) and never muddled.

No loops, scaffold, or register drift; final lines achieve propulsion through syntactic variation and concrete image (“Ella Fitzgerald sang on”).

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “spoons had bent three days ago, curling in on themselves like dying leaves” establishes voice, stakes, and rule-break in one stroke. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (shadows “looked almost like people,” automaton unfolds “like a flower remembering spring”), avoiding muddle. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with intensity, and every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “shrewdly innocent in her trespass” compresses motive and action. Figurative language is precise (“ache that never quite healed,” “sorrow into stars”) without purple excess. One minor redundancy: “forgiving skeptic” appears twice, but the second use reframes it as earned self-forgiveness. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic resolution—cadence slows, then lifts with the child’s laugh.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “frosted surfaces reflectively vibrant” does triple duty (visual, tactile, thematic). Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances plot or character. Figurative language is coherent—light metaphors (dragon’s breath, stars, pearls) accumulate without contradiction. Minor deduction: “zephyr bloom” slightly over-explained, but rhythm (“cold light, gentle as...”) justifies it. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“gathered... stood... looked back... made her way”) mirrors resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “carpets of emerald velvet,” “data once screamed through cables at the speed of light” merge tech and organic imagery without mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary (“She touched…”, “After the confession…”, “Mira knelt…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances character, setting, or theme. Minor deduction for slight overuse of figurative language in one high-pressure beat (“honeyed hush… thick and sweet”), but clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “mist breathed through the feral nexus like something alive” establishes rhythm without purple excess.

Figurative language is purposeful (“skeletal apple trees,” “flash-paper alchemist,” “frost scattered from her lips like released spirits”) without muddle. Sentence openings vary naturally; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence.

Figurative language is pattern-taught (“shingled hush,” “mineral sweat”) and payoff-integrated. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“She had traveled,” “Above the grotto’s mouth,” “Her name was”).

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “hauntingly practical” workshop conveys history and function in three words). Minor overwriting in “crystallized it through the slow work of blade against grain”—“crystallized” slightly strains the metaphor established earlier. Otherwise, syntax varies masterfully, paragraph lengths mirror thought rhythms, and every image serves theme or character. Final line’s “here and gone between one breath and the next” risks cliché but redeems itself by echoing the story’s core concept with fresh specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density (“chemical ghosts,” “fractured stillness,” “phosphorescent spray”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, setting, or theme.

    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (fire/ash/volcanic motifs) and never muddled in peak beats. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies naturally (fragments, complex sentences, inverted clauses). Final line (“preparing to sing”) recharges the opening ash image without redundancy. Minor deduction for one slightly elevated phrase (“unyielding compassion”) that borders on abstraction but is grounded immediately after.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“dry fountain basins lined every corner, their pipes clogged with crystallized recollections”).

No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is controlled (“thundering calm,” “roots beneath her feet”) and avoids muddle.

No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; sentence variety supports emotional cadence. Final line perfectly recharges the cupped-hand motif.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting in “blade of frozen night” risks purple prose but is redeemed by consistency. One paraphrase loop: “each accurate hour was its own small restoration” / “each correct chime a prayer”—slightly redundant, but rhythm justifies it. Final lines avoid scaffold; “searing reverie of dusk” earns its lyricism through accumulated specificity. No filter-verb stacks or syntactic monotony; read-aloud rhythm varies masterfully.

    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“dust settled into corners where children played and old women wept” conveys setting, theme, and emotion). Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual breath. One minor flaw: “thistled calm” slightly strains metaphor coherence (thistles imply pain, calm implies peace)—a hairline muddle in a peak descriptor. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or artifacts; closure image is sharp and unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with zero loops or scaffold. Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot: “sharp edges that had been smoothed only where the wearer's skin would touch” reveals both object and ethic.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, setting, or theme. Minor redundancy in “competing narratives” phrasing (lines 22 and 28) triggers a −0.3 loop penalty, but no scaffold or filter-verb stacks dull immediacy. Figurative language is coherent (sedimentary truth, abrasive calm), and sentence openings vary naturally. Closure image (“smiled in the darkness. It was enough.”) earns its quiet power without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is purposeful (“silences were fuller than others,” “autumn leaves surrendered to gravity”) without purple excess. Minor deduction for one near-paraphrase: “the weight of students who had stopped coming, of traditions that had stopped mattering” slightly overlaps conceptually, though the cadence justifies it. Otherwise, syntax varies, verbs are strong, and the final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors tentative hope.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most lines multitask (e.g., “iron bones bleeding orange” establishes setting, tone, and metaphor). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“synaptic plasticity” slightly clinical), but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence earns its lyricism. One near-paraphrase (“ruins” / “broken promises”) prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “amber sky,” “honey-thick light,” and “phosphorescent moss” serve atmosphere and plot. Sentence openings vary (“The lightning collection tower stood…” / “Travelers rarely came…” / “A woman approached…”), avoiding monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “phosphorescent algae painted everything in shifting green light” establishes setting, mood, and motif in one stroke. Sentence openings vary (“Coral had claimed…”, “She had been…”, “Mira threaded…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., post-revelation pause before ampoule exchange). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language (“grief wrapped around desperate hope”) remains coherent. The final line (“Some conversations were worth eternity”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Each sentence multitasks: “The staircase provided. The staircase always provided, in its terrible, generous way” establishes setting, character worldview, and thematic tension in 14 words.

Sentence openings vary (“Vera had been climbing…” / “Today, she rolled…” / “Her heart—that stubborn, hoping thing—quickened”), and paragraph cuts heighten momentum. The final line’s dice rattle echoes the opening, closing the loop without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with high information density (“moonlight that dripped through condensation-streaked panes”).

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “tide pools holding the last breath of retreating water” does setting, mood, and metaphor in one. Figurative language is coherent (light as “fishing line,” rocks as “vertebrae”) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the climax (“trailing light… like a fishing line cast into deeper waters” borders on mixed vehicle), but closure remains vivid and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“teeth that seemed to exist in too many dimensions”). Figurative language is controlled—no muddle or purple excess—and rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, plot, or atmosphere (“The metal had cracked... split by time and salt” conveys history, obstacle, and decay). Figurative language is restrained and coherent (sun as “weight,” city “protesting”).

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “ivy crawled… threading through broken skylights” establishes setting, mood, and metaphor). Zero paraphrase loops; syntax varies purposefully. Figurative language is coherent (serpents swallowing tails → self-consuming lies). Minor density in mid-section (“chemical analyses… linguistic studies…”) borders on catalog but serves thematic accumulation. Final paragraph’s cadence (“covering the tracks that led nowhere and everywhere”) earns its lyricism through prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“barnacles crusted the marble benches where lovers had once whispered promises they couldn't keep”). Figurative language is controlled and coherent (drowning crown, tapestry of longing). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “pressure of fathoms pressed against reinforced glass domes” conveys setting, physics, and mood). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor overwriting in “dappled resolve”—slightly abstract—but immediately grounded by action. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“readjusted her lamp… began the patient work”) crystallizes theme without redundancy. Near-flawless, but “dappled resolve” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose maintains high information density—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere—but occasional figurative stacking (“grief hung heavier than the mists below,” “sorrow she couldn't carry in her chest”) slightly dilutes propulsion in early beats. However, line-level control sharpens under pressure: the climax uses stark, kinetic phrasing (“Light blazed… shadow scattered… reassembled”) without purple excess. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence (e.g., the single-line “But paper wasn't enough anymore” as pivot). Minor deduction for one near-redundant descriptor (“crystalline spires that captured starlight and refracted it into dreams”), but closure image remains unblurred and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but precise: “tasting copper and ash,” “clouds churned in patterns that resembled brain tissue.” Minor overwriting in “perturbation equations scrolled… each variable representing…” slightly slows momentum. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resignation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“gears that had waited centuries began to turn”). Rhythm varies—long descriptive phrases for dusk, short clauses for action (“She pulled…”, “Gears… turned”). One minor overwriting lapse: “perpetually surprised expression she now wore whenever she looked at the sky” slightly abstracts; could be more embodied. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; figurative language is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “sieved hush” conveys auditory void and emotional suspension in three words. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“She had come,” “For twelve years,” “But the letter”).

    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “wind had eaten the stone,” “letters she never sent,” “wisdom often wore the face of someone we loved.” Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency (“the brass weight a familiar burden against her hip”). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (fog as “old grief,” poles as “wooden sentinels”), never muddled. Minor scaffold in “merrily melancholic” risks label-speak but is immediately grounded in action (humming Marcus’s shanty). Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with paddling cadence, and the final line resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or conflict. Figurative language is purposeful (“weight of them pressing like a phantom limb”) and consistent—no mixed metaphors.

The final line (“searching for meaning in the spaces between what was written and what was meant”) echoes the newspaper motif without redundancy, closing the syntactic and thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is potent but not overwhelming—“stars burn cold from a distance but could consume worlds up close” crystallizes Mira’s paradox without muddle. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the spice description (“cinnamon bark stripped from trees that remembered the first words ever spoken”), which edges toward purple prose but doesn’t obscure closure. Otherwise, rhythm, clarity, and propulsion are masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence multitasks (e.g., “lungs burning and heart full of desperate hope” conveys physical state, emotion, and motive). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“time sliding past like glass,” “grief preserved in amber”) and pays off in the saucer’s glow. Zero loops or scaffold—every image advances plot or character. Closure beat (“three years of love restored”) avoids summary by tying directly to tactile anchors (cards, saucer, tablecloth tracing). Read-aloud rhythm varies masterfully: long lyrical flows for memory, staccato urgency for ritual acts.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“cathedral of salvaged memories,” “liquid starfire”), but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats—e.g., “emotional residue that shimmered faintly in certain light” slightly muddles cause/effect. Sentence variety supports momentum, yet one paraphrase loop exists (“grief for something lost, yes, but beneath it, a darker thread. Guilt.”). Still, line-level craft largely serves propulsion and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“wealth felt like walls and she wanted windows”). Figurative language is coherent (fireflies = “captured constellations,” sand = “crushed obsidian”) and pattern-taught early. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; paragraph lengths vary purposefully. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “whispering hush” description (“sound so layered and ancient it felt like the breath of something sleeping”)—elevated but not jarring. Closure beat (“tides… give everything away”) is clear, resonant, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, propulsive, and varied: opening sentence establishes tone and stakes in one sweep; metaphors (“shadows… grown teeth,” “cradle of sparks”) are coherent and purposeful. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the middle (“twelve sparks, waiting for a cradle”)—a near-abstraction—but it’s redeemed by immediate grounding in named recruits. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic shift from action to poised aftermath, with zero artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful (“aurora rippled… like silk torn from dying stars”) and consistent—no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; high information density (e.g., “friction disappeared” explained through ships sliding, people gripping ropes). Closure beat is artifact-free: “the eels began to dance” resonates without overwriting. Read-aloud ear confirms rhythmic control under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“sea of gray violence,” “shadow alphabets”) is coherent and purposeful. Minor flaw: slight overwriting in “furiously tranquil waves, an oxymoron made weather,” but it serves thematic resonance. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; closure beat (“smiled into the illumination”) lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “brass gears whirring softly against the backdrop of the quiet brook” merges sound, material, and setting in one breath. Figurative language is purposeful—dragonflies “skated,” teacups “shattered”—never purple. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with tension. Zero loops or scaffold—every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Final image (“brook flowed on”) echoes opening, recharging the motif with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: “water-damaged Thoreau” conveys history, humor, and stakes in three words. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Mira discovered,” “She remembers,” “The coffee tin sits”). Figurative language is precise (“fractured light through broken glass”) without muddle. Minor deduction for one slightly purple phrase (“luminous and cracked”) in peak beat, but propulsion remains taut. Final line’s repetition (“Always together. Always under stars.”) is purposeful cadence, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “latticed walkways rising and falling with atmospheric currents that remembered the ocean” establishes setting, character, and theme in one breath. Figurative language is coherent (compasses flicker like indecision; music weaves between projection and reality). Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Final line (“the piano silent at last”) resonates by reversing earlier motifs without redundancy, closing the sonic arc cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “purple starflowers cascaded down limestone terraces” merges setting and theme in one clause. Figurative language is purposeful (“doubt glowed... like phosphorescence”) without muddle. Minor density in mid-section (“documenting how stories shifted...”) slightly slows momentum but anchors BRR compliance. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Final line’s cadence (“empirically whimsical, gloriously uncertain”) crystallizes tone without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each line multitasks (e.g., “ghost ship’s compass... pointed to things other than north” establishes mystery, character history, and plot device). Figurative language is consistent (nautical/mist motifs) with no mixed metaphors. Minor deduction: slight overuse of lyrical modifiers (“impossibly intricate,” “particular silence”) in opening beats, though never obscuring clarity. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully mirrors tidal return, earning its lyricism.
