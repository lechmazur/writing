  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.4)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("gradual change" appears 3x, "needless drama" 3x, "humility kindling" 2x). Template cadence emerges in middle ("Day by day...layer by layer") and filter-verb clustering appears ("she saw," "she felt," "she spent hours"). Information density is moderate but repetitive phrasing dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of clarity ("She traced a frozen tendril with her finger, watching it melt into revelation") but suffers from overwriting in places. Phrases like "drifting resonance" and "luminous creations" appear multiple times, creating subtle loops. The text relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("quiet wonder," "vital pauses") that reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("pressed against his ribs like a forgotten heartbeat") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("silently expressive" appears 4 times, "unshaken marvels" 3 times). Several sentences begin with character names creating mild template cadence. Information density generally high but some scaffold remains ("Elias knew then that...").

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with evocative imagery, but some redundancy appears: "weary"/"weariness" repetition, and the "chased stillness" concept restated multiple times. The phrase "inadvertently stubborn" feels forced into the narrative. Information density is high in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"their lives measured in whispers and rationed breaths," "shadows like ghosts with full baskets." However, some abstract phrasing weakens density: "nourished our legacy," "stitching grandparents' tales to grandchildren's dreams." The figurative language occasionally strains ("vines twisting like forgotten promises") but doesn't obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery, but suffers from overwriting in places ("ephemeral glimmers of forgotten divinity," "half-remembered dream"). Template phrases like "spiritually curious soul" and repeated abstract concepts ("foggy lucidity" appears 4 times) create some drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements, but overwriting appears in peak beats ("quaking reverie" repeated three times, mixed metaphors like "bridges pulsed with life" while being "veins"). The prose suffers from occasional register drift into overly elevated diction and some template cadence in the vision sequence, though clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("staggering grace" appears three times) and some overwrought metaphors. Filter verbs cluster in places ("he memorized," "he knelt"). Information density is good in action sequences but some descriptive passages could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.2)
    Strong imagery appears throughout ("hulls encrusted with barnacles," "ashen plumes that danced under the aurora"), but the bracketed self-corrections create severe artifacts that break immersion. Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("tears mixed with the brine on her cheeks"). The text also contains repetitive constructions and some purple prose that reduces clarity ("wary wonder," "battered marvel" used multiple times).

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, though figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("cascade of pale light that bathed the portrait in otherworldly radiance"). Minor template cadence appears in the emotional sequence ("Tears pricked...she wasn't just...but a guardian"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, and no significant loops or scaffolding appear.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.0)
    Strong moments like "the molten glass swirling like a captive storm" demonstrate control, but template constructions appear ("Elias stepped," "Elias spotted," "Elias ventured"). The prose occasionally loops concepts—"safe zones for inquiry" and "sanctuaries where inquiry could flourish" paraphrase without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Several template phrases weaken momentum: "trembling certainty" appears twice verbatim, "whispers/whispering" cycles throughout, and abstract declarations like "vulnerability wasn't weakness—it was the crack through which truth flooded" replace concrete imagery. The prose maintains basic clarity but relies on tell-heavy constructions ("Heart pounding," "driven to prove") that dull immediacy. Mixed metaphors (seashell's "oceanic memory," library as "cosmic spotlight") muddy key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "marbled hush" appears four times with minimal variation, and "summarizing silence/summarizing it/summarized" creates repetitive stems. Template cadence emerges in "She retold... summarizing" constructions. Information density suffers from ornamental descriptions that don't advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("the last light fractured across icicles like forgotten memories") but suffers from paraphrase loops and abstract redundancy. Multiple sentences restate the amalgamation concept without added pressure. Filter-verb stacks ("she sensed," "Elara felt," "she saw") appear in peak moments, dulling immediacy. The final paragraph's philosophical density ("thoughts came from everywhere and nowhere, amalgamated through the loops of existence itself") trades concrete image for conceptual summary.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong control in places but suffers from ornamental density—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Mixed metaphors appear ("mistrust had seeped...like rain" then needs "thawing"). Template phrases like "with trembling fingers" and "breath caught" diminish originality. The resonant hush repetition works as intentional pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from exposition-heavy passages that slow momentum. Sentences like "These weren't mere toys; they were talismans of mended deceptions" tell rather than show. Some metaphors strain ("hedges twisted like forgotten promises"). Information density is uneven, with backstory about 2092 creating drag rather than advancing present action.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dense figurative language pervades without clear pattern or payoff ("icy warmth," "frozen flames," "tapestry of sideways eternity"). Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("gasped, tracing a projection"). The meta-commentary about word count breaks immersion entirely. Information density is moderate but some passages feel padded with atmospheric description.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structure and rich imagery, though density occasionally tips toward overwriting: "pregnant pauses," "liminal realms," "spectral memories" cluster densely. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some metaphoric strain appears ("lapped at the orchestra pit like forgotten applause") but generally serves atmosphere. Minor template cadence in the middle section with repeated "Elias + verb" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from overwriting with metaphor density too high for peak beats ("clouds clung like forgotten dreams," "veil," "ethereal dance" in opening alone). The bracketed meta-commentary about word count and adjustments severely disrupts momentum and reveals scaffolding. Template phrasing appears in emotional descriptions ("wave of auroral sorrow washed over her").

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variety and purposeful compression. However, several overwrought phrases impede momentum: "like a vein pulsing with half-remembered life," "whispering secrets of industrial ghosts." The extended metaphors occasionally strain clarity without adding pressure. Filter-verb clusters appear in emotional peaks ("he felt the pull," "he wondered if") reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with good information density, though several instances of purple prose ("fireflies," "lantern") and some paraphrase loops ("regenerative silence" appears 6 times with similar phrasing). Template cadence in "He saw... He entered... He seated" sequence deducts -0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine lyricism but suffers from repetitive phrasing—"ordinary magic" appears 5 times, "dreaming roots" 4 times, "cautious/cautiously" forms 4 times. Sentence variety generally works though some constructions feel strained ("her movements softly adaptive to the boy's hesitant energy"). The piece maintains momentum despite the repetition, and the eclipse sequence flows well.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("displaced axis that had tilted the world's forgotten pivots"). Some repetition of "displaced" and "bronze" works thematically but borders on excessive. The final sentence effectively crystallizes the piece though "bronze eternity" risks purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing ("transpose his life/existence/lives" appears 5 times; "open secrets" 6 times; variants of "orchestrate" 4 times) creating synonym churn rather than precision. Template cadence runs appear ("Elias saw...Elias smiled...Elias watched"). Several metaphors strain clarity ("shifting from monotonous rhythm to symphony"). The line "lives transposing in harmony" exemplifies the abstract telling that replaces concrete dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from consistent abstraction ("threads of reality converged like whispers") and repetitive constructions around the core concepts. Multiple instances of "unraveled stillness" and "muffled clarity" create loops, while peak action moments summarize ("The possession recoiled slightly") rather than dramatize with concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dense figurative language occasionally obscures clarity ("horizons folding into infinities of sound"). Template phrases appear ("trembling fingers," "thick with anticipation"). The prose achieves moments of beauty but overwriting in peak beats dulls momentum—"the glass spire trembled faintly with the birth of day" feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from abstract figurative language that obscures concrete action: "timelines fusing in a cascade of light" and "fractured timelines...leaving her soul scattered across what-ifs." Template phrasing appears ("She had glimpsed...and now...she would"). The labyrinth section improves with clearer action but resolution returns to abstraction. Line "between the drop and the ripple" effectively captures suspended time.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structure, but several issues accumulate: repetitive use of "filament of hush" (4x), "audibly muted" (3x), and "turning seasons" (3x) without sufficient variation; some overwritten metaphors ("petrified bloom," "silent rivers"); and occasional redundancy ("hush mirror her struggle, then crack it open"). The template-like rhythm in places ("She recalled... Perhaps, she thought... With steady hands...") detracts from otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between tranquil observation and rising tension. Information density is generally strong, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. However, abstract phrases like "layered tranquility" appear multiple times, and some constructions ("progressing laterally" used both literally and metaphorically) create minor opacity without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and rich information density. Some overwriting appears ("gnawing motivation," "spectral signatures") but doesn't obscure clarity. The final sentence's multiple participial phrases create slight awkwardness. Generally strong rhythm and momentum, with effective use of specific technical language (bioluminescent threads, ultraviolet revealing).

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades with purple phrases like "luminous forms pulsing like captured auroras" and abstract metaphysical musings that slow momentum. The meta-commentary about word count ("Wait, error in count—true total is 712 words") is an egregious artifact that shatters the fictional frame. Template phrases like "ethically playful" and "passionate subtlety" read as forced prompt insertions.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("skeletal husks of shipwrecks," "ripples unbind the stillness") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "chronic hush" (5 instances) and "magnificent simplicity" (3 instances). Some abstract scaffolding appears in emotional summaries like "etched with weariness." Information density is moderate; several passages could compress without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("static kiss," "amber grotto's hush") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around transformation/subsume concepts and occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages. Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly in the middle section describing her trade and clients. Information density is uneven, with some paragraphs doing multiple jobs while others merely restate.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished with varied syntax and strong imagery. However, several ornamental phrases don't advance the story ("symphony of violins still humming"), and there's repetitive use of "cautious exuberance" and "silent contributors." The elevated diction occasionally drifts toward purple without earning its flourishes.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.1)
    Template phrases repeat throughout ("luminescent ache" appears 3 times, "bold sympathy" 4 times), creating synonym loops that dull impact. The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("crystals refracted light into rainbows that danced across the crater's rim") but suffers from overwriting in emotional peaks and repetitive sentence openings ("Elara..." begins multiple sequential sentences).

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery, but several passages suffer from abstract complexity that slows momentum ("the interrupted cadence now a personal torment, pulling her between past sketches and future voids"). Some conceptual redundancy appears in the time-borrowing explanations. The final paragraph achieves strong closure rhythm despite earlier density issues.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dense figurative language appears in most sentences ("moon had risen high enough to silver the silence," "gnawed at her," "twisted like roots") without pattern-teaching, creating ornamental overwriting. Several paraphrase loops occur ("ambiguous loss"/"undefined and lingering," "quantify the heartache"/"mathematics of emotion"). The prose achieves atmosphere but sacrifices momentum to decorative language.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("to become visible to those who needed him"/"to become visible, not for glory"). Template cadence appears in "Elias knelt...and together they imagined...In that shared silence" sequence. Metaphorical consistency holds with the sapphire/shadow imagery threading throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.8)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "releasing control"/"letting go"/"released the tight hold" repeat the same concept. Template cadence appears in transformation description ("Her veins tingled... her skin prickling... She felt her thoughts slow"). The meta-comment about word count breaks immersion entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax, though some overwriting appears ("haggard awe" repeated, "unearthed convergence" used multiple times). Information density is good but occasional redundancy exists ("exhaustion"/"fatigue" proximity). The "thresh" metaphor works but approaches overuse.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though several instances of elevated diction feel forced ("sanctum," "interstices"). The repetition of "steadily unpredictable" and "overlapping shadows" creates some template cadence. Information density varies—the pilgrimage backstory could compress further while the possession moment could expand for clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("fragments of weathered scrolls and bone-carved maps") with good rhythmic variation across sentences. Information density stays high in descriptive passages. However, template cadence appears in the vision sequence ("She saw how... Navigating this absence, Elara compiled..."), and abstract phrasing dulls immediacy in places ("visions rippled outward, reactively stirring hearts"). Some metaphors strain credibility ("turning navigated absences into paths forward").

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of overwriting diminish impact: "symphonies of ink," "emotional currents of a journey," "urban riddle." Template phrasing appears ("With trembling certainty" repeated, "analytically artistic" used as compound modifier). The final paragraph contains some scaffold phrases that could be cut ("In that moment," "knowing this journey would").

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, several template phrases appear: "sculpt space for reflection" (used twice), "entangled memories" (repeated), "unheard symphony" (multiple variations). Some overwriting in figurative density during the vision sequence. The final third contains unnecessary abstraction that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows strong moments ("walls that shimmered like fractured rainbows") but suffers from abstraction loops in crucial beats: "void within her had cracked," "quiet revolution of the soul," "purpose anew" remain conceptual rather than concrete. Template cadence appears in the resolution sequence ("She was unchanged... but the void... Intrigue had given..."), reducing propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("deathly vitality" used repetitively), some template phrasing ("Heart pounding with deathly vitality"), and minor scaffold in the mathematical formula presentation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dense figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff ("gilded-leaf stationer," "elusive grains of time," "incandescent restraint"). Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum, particularly around the concept of collecting textures/histories. The prose prioritizes atmospheric description over narrative propulsion, creating beautiful but static passages.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths matching tide patterns, though occasional overwriting appears ("treacherous streams," "indifferent embrace"). Information density high—most lines advance atmosphere, character state, and accumulated stories simultaneously. Some abstract phrasing ("texture of memories") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but repetitive use of "retelling/reimagined" (8 instances) creates mild template cadence. Some abstract phrasing ("universal riddle," "ephemeral compass") lacks concrete grounding. The "gloomy cheer/cheerfulness" repetition feels forced rather than pattern-taught. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously. However, template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("Lira's orderly intuition guided her," "Lira's absorption of shocks peaked") and some paraphrase loops ("reorganization meant honoring the foundation while adapting"). Abstract phrasing like "orderly intuitive" and "dual allegiance" creates distance. The prose maintains momentum despite these artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some overwriting appears ("silvery melancholy," "ethereal quiet that had whispered across this void for eons"). Information density is high when describing the chemical process and sand grain discovery. Template phrases like "purposefully curious" repeat without variation, and some metaphors strain ("shadows pooling like forgotten dreams").

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("iron tracks kissed the edge of a restless harbor") but suffers from occasional purple patches and the meta-commentary about word count that breaks immersion. Some metaphors strain ("whisper of his soul poured into steel"), though overall clarity remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose suffers from consistent overwriting with figurative language in most sentences ("creaked under the weight of perpetual frost," "iron walls flaking like old skin," "veins of continents"). Template cadence appears in runs like "Elias stood...He would herald...He shook it off" and paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("singular convergence" repeated four times). Information density is moderate but hindered by ornamental description.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant overwriting issues: "wild hush" appears 4 times, creating repetitive phrasing. Dense figurative language clutters high-pressure beats ("weathered stones, carved with runes that seemed to pulse faintly in the dimming light"). The 800-word story is delivered as a single paragraph wall of text, eliminating visual rhythm. Some effective moments like "cobblestones humming underfoot" but momentum stalls under ornamental description.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong momentum through the crisis. Deduction for overwriting in places: "lonesome splendor of drowned antiquity," "fragile thread of hope," and clustered figurative language in high-pressure beats without clear payoff (-0.5). Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures create momentum. However, abstract phrases like "sustaining impossibilities" and "hovering slightly askew" occasionally muddle clarity. Some metaphorical density in peak moments ("sustaining the impossibility that stories could bridge chasms") edges toward overwriting without full pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several template patterns weaken momentum: "One [time marker]" opens four paragraphs; "Elias [verb]" repetition creates drumbeat rhythm. Strong moments like "kiss that promised ecstasy but delivered the slow burn" show capability. Overuse of abstract compounds ("mournful elation," "resonant awakenings") and some paraphrase loops around the debt concept reduce clarity. The prose serves the atmosphere but lacks consistent propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pervasive overwriting dulls momentum: "shadow infused with orchid solace—a gentle, blooming comfort that wrapped the desolation in petals of quiet hope" exemplifies the density problem. Template structures appear ("She was...", "They gathered...", "The canyon walls...") and abstract metaphors obscure concrete action throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from extensive paraphrase loops ("interrupted journeys" appears five times with minimal variation) and abstract declarations that replace concrete action ("her faith, lost amid diaspora drifts and skeptical urban nights, flickered here"). Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("She sought...," "She carried...," "She wandered..."). The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the key transformation, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures, but suffers from overwriting in places—"holographic billboards flickered like dying stars" and similar elevated metaphors appear frequently without pattern-teaching. Some template cadence emerges in the middle section with repetitive "He/His" openings across multiple paragraphs. Information density remains solid with most lines advancing atmosphere or action.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density through specific imagery like "threading needle with silken starlight" and "prismatic light onto her chart." However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "unheard stories"/"faint narratives," "echoed silence"/"eternal hush," and the concept of hidden truths restated multiple times. Template cadence appears in "Elara traced...She traced" and "She would slip...She would." Information density remains strong in technical passages about synchronization.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("roots coiled like forgotten promises") but suffers from repetitive abstract phrases—"fierce tenderness" appears four times, "singing spirits" five times. Some sentences strain with elevated diction ("cognitive smoothness that omits misunderstanding"). The figurative density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in describing the spiritual mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwritten with figurative language in most sentences ("mist-clad atrium," "sedative spell," "lotus-hearted ache") creating density without purpose. Multiple paraphrase loops like "shared anxieties" appearing four times, and template phrases like "grafting new meaning" repeated verbatim.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from overwriting with dense figurative language that occasionally obscures clarity: "the world folded into the gentle crease of a daydream" and similar constructions appear frequently without clear payoff. The meta-commentary about word count at the end is a significant artifact that breaks immersion. Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("spark of curiosity ignite within him"), and several passages loop concepts without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "The coin was her talisman, a reminder that beauty often hid in the scratches of hardship." Some template cadence appears in the reflection sequence ("The first reflection... Another reflection..."), and phrases like "methodically playful" repeat without variation, creating minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong prose rhythm and varied syntax supporting scene momentum. Vivid imagery like "vines twisted like frantic thoughts" does multiple jobs. Some elevated diction ("verdant," "nascent") slightly strains the rogue scholar register but doesn't obscure clarity. Information density high with minimal scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    While individual sentences achieve lyric beauty, the prose suffers from density overload—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern or payoff. Phrases like "centuries of longing weaving through her veins like the off-key wind" mix metaphors confusingly. The text loops conceptually around longing/centuries/transformation without advancing, and abstract constructions ("photosynthesized grace," "ensconced peace") obscure concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is moderate with purposeful figurative language like "foxglove regret" recurring meaningfully. However, several passages contain conceptual redundancy—"deserted marvels" appears three times with minimal variation, and phrases like "extinct feelings" and "forgotten names" cycle without adding pressure. The prose occasionally loops in abstraction rather than advancing through concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("dust motes danced like forgotten syllables") but suffers from repetitive structures and abstract emotional labeling. Template cadence appears in "She [verb], She [verb]" patterns across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops emerge with "restore that trust, to mend what the quiet had torn" restating the same concept. The final paragraph's "trust restored...ready to face whatever lay beyond together" explicitly summarizes rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    While individual sentences often achieve poetic resonance, repetitive structures appear ("Elias had come," "Elias stood," "Elias felt") and some metaphors stretch thin. The "slyly heartfelt" repetition feels forced rather than pattern-taught, and abstract phrases like "harmonizer of worlds long at odds" lack the story's otherwise concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like "leaned like weary sentinels" but suffers from repetitive "blooming/withering" constructions (appearing 6 times). Several sentences run long without clear rhythmic purpose, particularly in exposition-heavy middle sections. The metaphor density occasionally obscures clarity ("fragments of the red planet smuggled into Earth's quiet corners"), though key images land effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("golden stalks that twisted like veins under harvest moons") but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern or payoff. Template cadence appears in "she recalled...she arranged...she stepped" sequence. Abstract phrasing like "fractured hush" and "featherly determined" repeats without gaining precision. The line "necessary distances were the quiet architects of meaning" ventures into explanatory territory that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe scaffold artifacts throughout: meta-corrections ("Wait, recount"), word-count tracking ("Total words: 512"), and self-conscious adjustments break narrative flow. Abstract phrasing dominates ("shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite") without grounding. Template academic register ("renowned," "anaerobic deep") clashes with attempted lyrical tone. These artifacts directly touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from overwriting with figurative language in nearly every sentence ("guardian of ephemeral memories," "bittersweet fog," "candle in twilight"). Template cadence appears in runs like "She had found...and now it became...," "Elara smiled...Elara felt...Elara continued." The phrase "cheerful gloom" repeats four times, creating a loop that dulls its effect.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("shells like applause," "salt-kissed machines") but suffers from conceptual redundancy—"orchestrated serendipity" appears multiple times without evolution, "calculated wilderness" repeats verbatim. Template phrasing emerges in "Elias watched," "Elias lifted," creating mechanical cadence. The phrase "between acts" appears four times without sufficient variation or payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades with phrases like "ethereal tendrils extended from the tattoo, weaving through the air like fledglings testing gales"—multiple metaphors stack without adding precision. Template cadence appears in "Elara rose...Elara directed...Elara smiled." The prose prioritizes ornamental description over propulsion, with many sentences doing single decorative duty rather than advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant overwriting pervades the piece with ornate phrases like "the harbor's soul whispered through every ripple and refraction" that prioritize atmosphere over momentum. Multiple paraphrase loops occur ("reading between the lines" appears twice with similar meaning; the ripple-reading sequence restates the same insight). Template cadence emerges in "Elias rose...Elias walked...Elias smiled" progression. The prose achieves atmospheric density but sacrifices clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=2.4)
    Catastrophic meta-commentary artifacts ("Actually, recalibrating: prior was 752") break all narrative momentum and reveal generation scaffolding. Beyond these breaks, prose shows competence with varied sentence structure and some strong images, but the text-artifact violations touching closure disallow any higher scoring. Multiple template phrases like "hard softness" appear forced.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density, though repetitive use of "serene upheaval" (appears 4 times) and some template cadence in the middle section ("She began by... Next, she... Elara's heart quickened..."). The opening and closing sentences effectively bracket the piece, but occasional overwriting ("vast mandala pulsing with tidal light") dulls precision.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though figurative language occasionally overwhelms ("ivy choked the very air, its tendrils weaving through shattered windows like veins of green memory"). Minor template cadence in "She + verb" constructions mid-story, but closure beat maintains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.9)
    Significant repetition issues: "perceptively calm" appears four times, "borrowed heartbeat" seven times, "echoes/echoing" six times. Template cadence pervades: "She had...," "She moved...," "She pictured...," creating monotonous rhythm. The prose relies on abstract descriptors ("dusky harmony," "grace") rather than concrete specificity. Filter verbs and paraphrase loops dull immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("silver light, flawed yet magnificent") but suffers from repetitive structures ("She had brokered... She moved operatively gentle") and some overwriting in metaphor density. Template cadence appears in the ritual sequence, though information density remains generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though figurative density occasionally tips toward overwriting ("ghosts," "living storms," "heartbeat" in quick succession). The "amoral heart a little less fractured" feels forced thematically. Information density is high and propulsion maintains through most beats.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("flakes drifted like forgotten whispers") but suffers from overwriting in peak beats—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears in "She extended...She worked...She stepped" construction. Mixed metaphor in "harvest of echoes" being both "fragments" and something drawn "into her bodily poetic core."

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and information density, though some elevated diction ("urbane," "seedy bars") occasionally feels overwrought. Minor template cadence appears in "Elias had defended... doubt crept in" sequence but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant overwriting pervades the piece with stacked modifiers ("verdant grotto perched above the endless drift of clouds, where moss-cloaked vines draped like forgotten veils") and abstract conceptual language that dulls momentum. Template cadence appears in the structure-building sequence ("She gathered...her hands steady as she began...Each structure was..."). While individual sentences achieve lyrical moments, the density of figurative language without pattern-teaching (-0.7) and occasional register drift into academic diction ("pragmatic rituals, grounded in the biology of light refraction") accumulate to obscure the story's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose demonstrates variety in sentence structure and some evocative imagery ("rope stirred, its braids undulating like waves"). However, several passages contain unnecessary scaffold ("She had come here, drawn by legends") and the text occasionally over-explains what's already shown ("now a bridge between past and present").

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("ancient oaks clawed at the sky like forgotten sentinels"). However, modifier density weighs down key passages—"precisely playful shadows," "ethereal grit," "translucent and wry" cluster without advancing pressure. Some template phrasing appears: "Elara traced...with trembling fingers" follows stock gesture patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant repetition weakens momentum: "dusky harmony" appears 4 times, "schematic representations" 3 times, "empirically ironic" 3 times, "frugal" 5 times, creating template-cadence issues. The prose relies on abstract descriptors ("otherworldly pulse," "ethereal light") rather than concrete sensory detail, though syntax varies and grammar remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose demonstrates solid control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the memory transmission. Some overwrought phrases ("enforced quiet," "poison that Elara sensed") and repetitive constructions around "shifting grace" create minor density issues. The cellular memory sequence maintains clarity despite conceptual complexity, though "grace carries us" and similar abstractions weaken precision.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structure and effective rhythm during the breathing sequence. Information density is good with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "glass mountains" (5+ instances), some abstract descriptors ("ethereal spires," "infinite worlds"), and occasional register elevation that doesn't match the craftsman POV.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from overwriting with dense figurative language appearing in most sentences ("shadowed husk," "verdant invasion," "deciduous vows"). Multiple instances of template cadence ("Elias grumbled...he refused...," "When the eye was done, Elias lowered...") and unnecessary modifiers ("endearingly feisty," "gnarled hands") reduce momentum without adding specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    Persistent overwriting issues: "bewildered curator" appears verbatim, "brightened disquiet" repeats, and abstract constructions like "simply complicated shadow" and "nonlinear threads binding her to an eternal, bewildered curation" create opacity. Template phrases ("wandered the astral orchard," "gnawed at her") and elevated diction that occasionally drifts into purple prose reduce propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dense figurative language appears in most high-pressure sentences without clear payoff ("labyrinth's paths now aligning like chords resolving in suspense"). Multiple mixed metaphors compete—musical, botanical, and temporal—creating cognitive friction. The prose prioritizes ornate description over momentum, with abstract phrases like "harmonizing the discordant timelines" replacing concrete action at the closure beat, dulling the specific mechanics of rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose density is high with most sentences advancing atmosphere or character state. However, multiple instances of overwriting appear: "blissfully aberrant," "unkindled solace," mixed metaphors ("carousel horses frozen mid-gallop" while fog parts). Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("Lira's face sharpened... not monstrous but majestic"). The ending note about word count and trimming disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose tends toward overwriting with dense figurative language ("serpent on a workbench," "welcoming arms") that occasionally obscures clarity. Template cadence appears in the rope-braiding sequence ("First, she loosened... she pressed it... Gently, she rewove"). Information density is high but momentum drags during the extended magical procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("Each line spoke of the storm's fury") but suffers from occasional overwriting: "iridescent forms slicing through the veil like lightning in a parched sky." Some template phrasing appears ("Deeper she ventured," "With deliberate care") though information density remains adequate for the ritual's precision.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variation and strong imagery, though several passages contain unnecessary abstraction and mild redundancy. The line "coincidences were not mere chaos, but threads woven with meaning" appears twice with minor variation, creating a paraphrase loop. Some sentences carry philosophical weight that could be grounded in more concrete imagery, particularly in the resolution paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.4)
    Severe repetition issues: "deepening hush" appears 7 times, "preemptively nostalgic" 4 times, "conjecture/conjectured" 6 times, creating template cadence. Abstract phrasing dominates ("sculpt identity from experience" repeated verbatim). The prose achieves atmospheric density but synonym churn ("whispers/murmurs/susurrus") and conceptual loops significantly impair momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("rockets soared...bursting into a vast mosaic") but suffers from overwriting in peak beats with figurative language appearing in most sentences without payoff ("cascades of night-blooming jasmine," "conspirators in the gathering dark," "defiant stars"). Template cadence appears in the climax sequence ("With deliberate care...," "With a flick..."). The density often works against momentum rather than enhancing it, particularly in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery, particularly in descriptions of the grotto and divination process. Information density is moderate with most lines advancing atmosphere or meaning. Deductions for occasional purple patches ("ethereal glow," "sacred space") and some repetitive phrasing around observation and seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong sensory specificity and rhythmic variation, particularly in the gravity inversion sequence. Information density is generally high, with most sentences advancing atmosphere or character. However, some metaphorical accumulation becomes dense ("silken thread...pulsing against her skin"), and phrases like "forgotten luxuries" and "opulent" feel slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose rhythm varies effectively and supports the meditative tone, but repetitive phrasing appears ("vaulting hush" x4, "in transit" x3) without full pattern-teaching payoff. Some abstract constructions blur immediacy ("silence transforming under his care into a comfort"). Information density is generally strong with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though momentum occasionally slows in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe overwriting pervades: nearly every noun carries modifiers ("neon-veiled spires," "rain-slicked towers," "vaulted chamber"). The meta-commentary about word count ("Wait, trim to fit; actual count will align in final. No, ensure 600-800") is an egregious artifact. Template phrases accumulate ("Heart pounding," "pulse quickened," "eyes traced"). Information density is low; many sentences merely describe without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.9)
    Strong moments like "shadows slithering across the floor like tendrils" demonstrate capable prose, but template cadence pervades: "She had burned...She had cut off...She lifted...She whispered." Abstract constructions like "loaded emptiness that pressed against her like an unyielding fog" and "fading threshold between her solitude and the echoes" create opacity. The paraphrase loop between "cutting off all contact" (line 2) and "cut off contact" (line 20) adds redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from density issues - nearly every sentence contains figurative language ("shadowed seams," "veined with roots," "quantum veil"). Template cadence appears in "She had encountered... she decided to play... she twisted the bolt" progression, and "shadowseam wonder" repeats mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally strong prose with evocative imagery, though some overwriting appears: "the first yawn of evening" feels precious, and "eloquent silence" gets repeated without variation. The standing waves concept is well-integrated, but phrases like "machinery that had both built and broken fortunes" edge toward purple. Information density is good, with most sentences advancing atmosphere, character, or discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("edges of the greenhouse blurring like ink in water") but suffers from repetitive phrasing: "factually mystical" appears 5 times, "shivering bliss" 6 times, "forgotten patterns" 6 times without meaningful variation. Several passages contain paraphrase loops ("No longer merely withdrawn, he was the weaver" followed by similar restatements). Template cadence emerges in multiple "Elowen [verb]" constructions. These artifacts don't obscure closure but create drag.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm supporting discovery pacing. Multiple instances of paraphrase loops ("small kindnesses" concept restated, dust patterns described redundantly) and some overwriting in metaphorical density ("veil," "bloom," "illuminate"). Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions across 3+ sentences. Information density high in discovery sequence but dulled by conceptual repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows strong moments ("dusk bled into velvet sky") but suffers from abstract concept-loops around "indifference" and "coded freedom." Several template constructions appear ("Elara froze," "His eyes met hers"). The extended single-sentence description of the phone booth key disrupts momentum without sufficient payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from overwriting in peak beats: "eerie nostalgia," "fleeting rainbows," "forgotten dreams" pile figurative language without pattern-teaching. Template phrases appear ("emerged from the shadows like a ghost," "heavy with eerie nostalgia"). Information density is moderate—some lines do multiple jobs, but others merely embellish. The closing image lands cleanly despite earlier ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though several instances of elevated diction blur clarity ("ashen skyborne arbor," "liminal stillness when whispers of ancestors mingled"). Some repetitive phrasing around "mossy delight" (appears 3 times) and "prodded" (4 times) creates minor loops. The accumulation of "tiny monuments" and transformation language in the final third maintains momentum despite occasional overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.8)
    Generally clean prose with good sentence variety and information density, but severely damaged by the fourth-wall-breaking meta-commentary about word count at the story's end. This major artifact disrupts the closure beat and reads as external scaffolding rather than narrative text.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, and the alchemical process maintains clear sequential logic. However, significant overwriting appears: "luminous regret suffused the chamber" and similar elevated diction clusters densely without pattern-teaching payoff (-0.5). Template cadence appears in "He would... He ground... He inscribed" sequence (-0.4). The prose achieves moments of clarity but struggles with consistent purple patches.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.7)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages ("Deep in the gorge's throat, a new soul cried out, its wail twisting through the air like a threadbare melody"). However, several abstract phrases weaken precision ("luminous ache" appears 4 times, "weight of betrayals," "unspoken burdens"), and some metaphor mixing occurs (souls both "echo" and have "ether"). The repetitive "pursued" creates mild template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("the air humming with invisible radiation that promised purification through pain") but suffers from conceptual redundancy and abstract phrasing. The "mathematics of mercy" concept repeats without evolution, and phrases like "displaced rootedness" and "rooted pull" create mixed metaphors. Filter verbs accumulate in the trauma sequence ("He felt," "memories surged"), dulling immediacy during a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    While individual sentences achieve lyrical beauty, the prose suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing ("elusively tangible" appears three times, "eternal instant" four times) and occasional overwriting ("like fog solidifying under moonlight"). The density of figurative language in high-pressure moments ("whispered the translation, a phrase from the between-tongues, her voice unraveling the glyph like a thread from a seam") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies action.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=2.8)
    The embedded revision notes and word-count commentary constitute severe text artifacts that destroy narrative momentum. Lines like "Wait, that's over—adjusting for count" and "Final count adjustment" are generation artifacts that should never appear in finished prose. Some individual sentences show competent craft, but the meta-interruptions pervade the crucial final third.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong moments like "fragments of frost-laced panes rained into the abyss" demonstrate control. However, abstract phrases proliferate: "negotiable veil," "temporal sprawl," "pinpoint of forever." The phrase "rustling awakenings" appears four times with minimal variation. Several sentences restate rather than advance, particularly in the philosophical passages.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.3)
    Strong moments of lyrical precision alternate with overwriting. Information density varies - some passages achieve multiple effects while others feel ornamental. Notable template cadence in places: "Elias whispered...Elias composed...Elias pocketed." The prose would benefit from pruning figurative excess, particularly in non-climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like "echoes danced like fireflies in twilight" but suffers from occasional overwriting ("metaphysical weave, frayed yet unbroken, hidden in the chamber's core—a pulsating orb"). Some template phrasing appears ("Elias felt," "Elias smiled") and abstract constructions like "tinkersong wonder" repeat without always advancing meaning. Information density is generally good, with most sentences carrying multiple functions, though the extended covenant exposition creates a momentum dip mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (setting/character/atmosphere). Rhythm varies appropriately, accelerating during descent and vision. However, several overwrought metaphors strain clarity ("limestone cliffs loomed like ancient sentinels," "womb of the earth"), and the phrase "resonant hush" appears four times, creating unnecessary repetition. Some filter constructions reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors (wood knots as "temporal knots," compass rose "dissolved into waves") and elevated diction mismatched to scene pressure. Template phrasing appears in "Elara's eyes widened," "tears mingling with," and the explain-everything final paragraph. The "turbine-hum reverie" repetition and abstract phrases like "ethereal threads" and "layered meanings" create opacity. Filter-verb stacks in the vision sequence ("She saw," "Elara felt," "she understood") trigger additional deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is generally strong with most sentences advancing multiple purposes, and the prose avoids major loops or scaffolding. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("gentle obsession that whispered," "umbral tenderness") and repetitive descriptors for the amber light reduce precision, while filter constructions ("she felt the pull") occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dense figurative language appears in most sentences ("labyrinth of leather-bound tomes," "invisible current," "spring in her chest") without payoff, creating overwriting that obscures action. Template phrases like "her life a archive of forgotten injustices" and repetitive "searing" descriptors indicate scaffold, while the rushed ending adjustment ("Wait, that's over—adjusting for count") breaks narrative immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose clarity generally serves the story, with evocative opening imagery of "weathered paper lanterns swaying along the fog-shrouded docks." However, repetitive phrasing appears throughout ("rejecting false comfort"/"rejected false comfort," multiple uses of "reimagine civilization"), and the working memory section contains list-like constructions that stall momentum. The rushed ending summarizes crucial action in generic terms.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("apple trees whispering secrets to the starlit skyline") but suffers from density issues with figurative language in most sentences without payoff. Multiple abstract metaphors pile up ("genie's wish," "bridge across centuries," "embers in the velvet night"). Template cadence appears in the memory sequence ("had sneaked...pocketing it...vowing silently") and paraphrase loops occur with "disquiet/unease" variations.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("crystalline walls trapped the night's chill like forgotten breaths") but suffers from density overload and abstract phrasing. Several passages border on purple prose with stacked modifiers ("wild, tranquil flow"). Template structures appear ("She had inherited...," "She began...," "She clutched...") and some metaphors strain credibility (seeds as "pinpoints of low entropy").

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("bell tolled once, a deep, resonant note that vibrated through the stone and into his bones"). Some overwriting appears in descriptive passages ("roiling sea far below, stars winking through gaps"), and mild repetition of "hush" and "microclimate variations" creates minor loops.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive overwriting weighs down momentum: "sentinel carved from stardust and silence," "luminous rebels streaking across the void," "elegant blades of forgotten light." Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("feeling the stars' terror and triumph, their plunge not an end but..."). The prose prioritizes ornamental metaphor over narrative propulsion, with nearly every sentence carrying figurative language that doesn't accumulate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good, with most lines advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("ethereal forms flickering into view like mirages given form") and some abstract phrasing that reduces immediacy ("profound unraveling").

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("Light bent, numbers swirled into irrelevance") but suffers from density overload and abstract loops. Phrases like "anticipated mysteries" appear four times; "texture of time" recurs without variation. The elevated register occasionally obscures clarity, particularly in explaining the post-Reckoning world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose achieves lyrical rhythm with varied sentence structures and sensory specificity. However, template phrases appear ("warmly attentive" used twice identically, "burnished hush" repeated three times) and some metaphors strain ("harmonizing discord" mixed with physical shell-handling).

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm shifts, though some overwrought phrases appear ("petrified giants from the earth," "eternal pact"). Information density is moderate - most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. The phrase "brazen calm" repeats three times, creating intentional pattern. Some filter constructions ("he felt") could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows purposeful rhythm and varied sentence structure, particularly in atmospheric passages. However, abstract formulations like "chemistry of homecoming" and "rebellious fusion" appear repeatedly without concrete grounding. Several instances of elevated diction ("elusive alchemy where particles of memory and soil fused") create distance where immediacy would serve better. The phrase "alchemy settle" and similar conceptual abstractions dull momentum in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but occasional overwriting appears ("blooming jetty" as both setting descriptor and thematic vehicle feels strained). Some template cadence emerges in the middle ("He knelt... He recalled... He worked...") though the closing rhythm recovers well.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("earth split like forgotten promises," "sun bled orange across the cracks") and good momentum. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("veins woven like veins in the leaf") and occasional register elevation ("reluctant heroism," "wild heart") that slightly dulls immediacy. Clean grammar and varied syntax support the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose tends toward density with multiple complex metaphors per paragraph ("graveyard of flickering emergency lights," "humming void," "spring uncoiled"). Some passages suffer from modifier stacking and abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy, particularly in emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments like "The spire pierced the heavens like a frozen spear" but suffers from occasional overwriting—"cautious abandon" appears as conceptual contradiction without embodiment, "architects of balance" reads as elevated abstraction. Information density remains solid through integrated action-description, though some template fantasy phrases ("howling winds," "frozen spear") lack specificity. The accumulative rhythm builds effectively toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from abstract modifiers and conceptual redundancy: "luminous absence" appears four times, "nomadic penumbra" three times. Template cadence emerges in lines 24-29 with repetitive "She/Her" openings. Information density is moderate—many sentences restate concepts rather than advance action ("bright void that mirrored her existence—present in what was not there").

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong figurative language ("corridors twisted like veins," "thunder grumbled distantly, hidden in the mountain's belly") creates atmosphere, though density occasionally overwhelms in early paragraphs. Some abstract phrasing weakens immediacy ("remembering became painful" could be more embodied). Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions, and the prose avoids repetitive structures despite the nightly pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("villagers suspended mid-step, mid-breath, like pieces on an unfinished board") but suffers from overwriting in places. Template cadence appears in the labyrinth sequence ("Here, the woven hush intensified... He fidgeted productively... Deeper in, illusions assailed him"). Some metaphors strain credibility ("platinum labyrinth... like the veins of a silver leaf"), and the elevated diction occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and information density, with evocative phrases like "sky bruised with perpetual twilight." However, multiple paraphrase loops appear ("forged hush"/"silence hammered into shape," "refracted"/"splintering"/"dispersing"), and some metaphor vehicles strain coherence (how does one "forge" a hush?).

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    Opening sentence runs 38 words with multiple subordinate clauses that challenge clarity. Strong imagery throughout ("brass and iron," "pitted with pockmarks") but several abstract phrases weaken immediacy ("thread through the steam vents," "tapestry of dire enchantment"). Repetitive "narrated" and "quilting" metaphors create minor loops. Final image lands effectively with "beacon against the acid night."

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, particularly strong in oasis description. However, multiple text artifacts reduce score: paraphrase loop ("temporary eternity"/"temporary eternities"), register drift into elevated diction ("intimately aloof no longer just to others but to his own unraveling"), and some purple prose ("pocket of eternity," "soul suspended"). Template cadence in "He knelt...he lifted...he unpacked" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("jasmine laced with the earth's quiet pulse") but suffers from occasional overwriting—"screaming in its quiet fury" forces paradox. Template phrases appear: "Minutes stretched into eternity," "gruff laugh." The piece would benefit from pruning some abstract conceptual language.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs: "waxing gibbous, his mind tugged at half-formed ideas" links lunar phase to mental state efficiently. Strong verb choices throughout ("hunched," "groaning," "clutched"). Minor template cadence in "Elias [verb]" constructions across several paragraphs. Some figurative density borders on overwriting ("star-kissed and silent no more") but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("gnarled sentinels suspended on terraced ledges") but several overwrought passages strain clarity. Template repetition appears ("Elias murmured...," "Elias prepared...," "Elias spoke...") costing −0.4. The verb "occlude" appears five times, creating noticeable repetition. Some metaphors feel forced ("Pain bloomed like a hidden fungus").

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, but several issues: redundant phrasing ("witnessed isolation" appears multiple times), some purple moments ("clung like a lover's regret"), and abstract constructions ("borrowing memories from objects touched by the desperate"). The line "softly persistent" repeats without clear pattern-teaching purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several overwrought passages: "phosphorescent fungi and vines heavy with luminous flowers, petals unfurling like secrets." Template cadence appears in "He followed...He approached...He consulted." The bracketed metacommentary at the end severely damages flow. Filter-verb clusters in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful imagery. Deductions for overwriting in places ("silken gown whispering against the stone floor like a veiled threat"), some register drift into elevated fantasy-speak, and the vague mechanics of the climactic incantation that weakens momentum at the crucial beat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant overwriting issues throughout: mixed metaphors ("ember nexus's twilight casting long shadows that danced like unspoken doubts"), redundant descriptions, and template constructions ("Elara smiled, pocketing a spark of the moment"). The prose often prioritizes ornament over momentum, with multiple paraphrase loops that restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows good rhythmic variation and information density, particularly in dream sequences where syntax mirrors disorientation. However, several instances of elevated diction feel forced ("talisman against the confusion," "lifelong vigil"), and there's occasional redundancy in emotional description. The "jaded wonder" repetition works as pattern but edges toward template.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors (fog as both veil and substance that "clings"), repetitive thematic phrases used 4-5 times each, and purple prose throughout ("visual poetry of mist-shrouded mechanisms"). Template cadence appears in structural repetition ("Elara watched...Elara perceived...Elara felt") and the paraphrase loop of screw descriptions reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from template cadence ("She sipped...She pulled...She began") and abstract descriptors ("fragile pause," "invisible marks"). Key transformative moments rely on telling ("she felt the shift") rather than concrete imagery. The phrase "scars reborn as tales etched in eternity" exemplifies the tendency toward abstraction over specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose suffers from overwriting with metaphors in most sentences ("paced the aisles like a shadow with a deadline," "ethereal grit that clung to her coat like urban fog"). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions. However, the closing image of music lingering despite fallen trees achieves genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from consistent overwriting with stacked modifiers and abstract metaphors that obscure clarity ("pregnant with all possibilities," "resonant hush that blended with the library's timeless silence"). Template cadence appears in repetitive "he [verb]" constructions. The meta-comment about word count breaks immersion. However, some phrases achieve genuine poetry, and the paradoxical descriptions occasionally land effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("fjord-quiet hush," "razor edges where choices lingered") but suffers from overwriting in places. "Eminently peculiar" repeats unnecessarily, and abstract phrases like "erosion of certainty" and "cutting away of illusions" create distance. The reversal sequence maintains momentum despite dense figurative language, but some sentences strain under their metaphorical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose achieves moments of lyric precision ("dew-kissed entrance," "azure fire") but suffers from repetitive "quiet wildfire" phrase appearing three times. The bracketed editorial notes at story's end constitute a major artifact. Some passages lean toward exposition ("a method to revolutionize quantum security") rather than embodied scene.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("rainwashed library," "clover melancholy") but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence carries metaphorical weight without sufficient breathing room. Template cadence appears in the scrawl interpretation sequence ("Next marking...It mirrored..."). Some paraphrase loops around the father's contradictions reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("glass panels fogged by perpetual dampness") and rhythmic control. However, several passages suffer from abstraction and telling: "cultivating a rapport that felt immediate, vital" and "recounting memories that soured, laughter that turned to silence" summarize rather than dramatize. The phrase "cultivated estrangement" appears multiple times without variation, creating repetitive phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant overwriting issues throughout: dense figurative language in most sentences ("twilight draped," "bruised lavender," "defiant fragrance"), repetitive conceptual phrases ("weight of small moments" appears 3 times, "haunted euphoria" 4 times), and runs of complex sentences that sacrifice clarity for atmosphere. The prose often does single-duty description rather than advancing multiple story elements. Template cadence appears in several passages ("She sat... she traced... As she did...").

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "ivy twisted like courteous vines, politely refusing to yield." However, several overwrought phrases appear ("gnawed at his nomadic soul," "fragile bridge in the anarchic calm") and some repetitive constructions ("Elias felt," "Elias lifted," "Elias vanished"). The extended rumor chain sequence contains some synonym churn that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid sensory specificity, though some passages suffer from modifier stacking ("fleeting tongues of migratory spirits") and occasional purple prose ("the quiet blaze of her spirit flared softly, illuminating paths forward"). The extended metaphorical language occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in emotional passages.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose displays strong rhythm and varied syntax, particularly in the opening. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. However, several abstract phrases lack concrete grounding ("contingent relationships—delicate webs of cause and effect") and the middle section contains some scaffolding around the concept of editing history that could be more elegantly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant overwriting issues throughout: "luminous harbor by moonlight shimmered like a forgotten dream," "joyful sorrow," "quietly charismatic smile that warmed the cool air." Multiple template phrases appear ("Elias felt," "Lir watched," "Together, they walked"). The prose achieves moments of clarity in the silence-mapping sequences but suffers from consistent purple tendencies and repetitive constructions that dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe line-level issues pervade: "volcanic tenderness" repetition, the jarring meta-commentary about word count, overwrought metaphors ("cataclysm of ash and love"), and template phrasing ("her heart burned with," "tears filled with"). The bracketed editorial notes destroy any remaining prose credibility. Information density is compromised by redundant emotional assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("sound waves curling like smoke") but suffers from repetitive phrasing - "auroral sorrow" appears 6 times, "quietly rebellious" 3 times, "drumming on everything" variants appear 5 times. Some metaphors strain coherence (universe inhaling/exhaling as structural device). Information density is high but momentum occasionally stalls in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is solid with most lines advancing multiple story elements. Template cadence appears in the opening ("Elias patrolled...The structures stacked...Elias, the maintenance worker") and some paraphrase loops ("his steps seeming random yet precisely aimed"). Minor scaffold in transitions but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with dense figurative language ("canal's lazy curves," "stars' quiet insistence") that slows momentum. Template phrases appear ("for the first time since," "drawn here by whispers") and the prose suffers from abstract emotional labeling rather than concrete embodiment. The opening sentence runs 31 words, creating immediate density issues, and paraphrase loops appear in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.3)
    Information density is moderate with chess metaphors and mist imagery serving multiple functions. However, numerous abstract declarations slow momentum ("humble rebellion," "dormant defiance," "thoughtful revolt"), and purple patches like "walls shimmered like deep ocean veins under a perpetual mist" add ornament without pressure. The phrase "forests of second thoughts" appears four times, creating unnecessary repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax and strong imagery, but some overwriting in metaphorical density ("frothed like whispered secrets," "moon's indifferent gaze") and repetitive conceptual phrasing around "guarded heart" and "combative tenderness." The final paragraph maintains momentum despite length, delivering the transformation sequence effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythmic variation and information density, particularly in "Whittle by whittle, the bird took shape," though some overwriting appears: "hummed like forgotten gods," "creaking under the weight of enforced silences." Minor template cadence in repeated "whittle" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose achieves moments of beauty ("shadows danced like fleeting whispers"), it suffers from overwriting - nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching payoff. Template cadence appears in "She placed...She began...She stepped" progression. The density of metaphors ("moth circling flame," "ancient sentinels," "silken wings") creates opacity rather than clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.2)
    Generally clear prose with vivid imagery of glass and flowers, but suffers from repetitive structures ("Elias... Elias... Elias..." openings) and occasional purple patches. Template cadence appears in the plant arrangement sequences, and some metaphors strain clarity ("silver threads through the courtyard").

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.4)
    Severe overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("golden shadows lengthened as the pilgrimage crested into a symphony") and purple prose density. Template cadence appears in "Elara [verb]" constructions repeated across paragraphs. The paraphrase loop "powerfully gentle touch...powerfully gentle wave" and synonym churn around "connection/ties/bonds" create redundancy that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, especially in descriptive passages. Deductions for multiple paraphrase loops ("mourning jewelry—lockets etched with wilted roses and shadowed cameos—taking shape" restates prior information) and occasional overwriting in figurative language ("curtains of intention, ethereal veils woven from starlight and will"). Template cadence in the Lira sequence ("Lira approached...Elara watched...Lira unfolded").

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("Rain pattered against the skylight, beads racing down the glass like frantic thoughts") but suffers from exposition-heavy dialogue and abstract declarations. The final paragraph's "profound reconnection to the human threads" exemplifies the story's tendency toward conceptual summary over concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong imagery and varied sentence structure, but overwriting appears throughout with dense figurative language in most sentences without clear pattern-teaching ("dust motes danced like forgotten stars," "atoms of nostalgia," "spectral figure"). Some paraphrase loops occur ("forbidden knowledge" concept restated multiple times). The elevated register occasionally obscures momentum, particularly in action sequences where ornate description slows the dance around the pagoda.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("clouds billowed like pages turned by an invisible wind") but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching payoff. Some metaphor mixing ("shadows stretched like fingers" vs "shadow unbound...like smoke"). Template cadence appears in "She had seen...," "She paused now...," "Elara's sharp eyes..." progression. Information density is moderate but could be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive overwriting with mixed metaphors ("spine forged in this nocturnal vigil"), redundant phrasing ("quietly vivid" appears four times), and template emotional progression. Multiple paraphrase loops: "fragile convictions" restated as "shattered illusions," then "fragile convictions, once shattered." The final third contains extensive scaffolding ("The end of the night marked a beginning") that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from overwriting with dense figurative language ("mist from a forgotten sea," "meteor's streak") that slows momentum. Several paraphrase loops appear ("seeking closure"/"closure demanded action"). Template structures recur ("She + verb" patterns). Information density is uneven, with the digging sequence extending without adding new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("dust motes danced like forgotten stars") but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching. Mixed metaphors appear ("storm brewing in her spatially imaginative mind"). Template cadence emerges in the psychometry sequence with repetitive "she saw/she envisioned" structures. The "hushed thunder" repetition works thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    Very dense figurative language appears in most sentences without clear pattern or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Metaphorical density ("shadowed rapture," "veils of light," "gravitational longing") pervades high-pressure beats. Rhythm varies well and no scaffolding present, but elevated register throughout creates distance from immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong opening establishes voice and world efficiently, but prose suffers from repetitive "bloom/blooming" (7 instances), template cadence in "He had discovered...To access...Elias began," and abstract phrasing like "occasionally everywhere presence." The final paragraph's "cultivation was not conquest, but a gentle unraveling" reads as explanatory rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptive passages like "Towering trees loomed overhead, their trunks forged from interlocking gears and pistons, branches swaying with hydraulic grace." However, abstract phrases like "wild frontier of his mind" and "hum of insight" recur without gaining specificity, and some sentences rely on telling rather than embodied showing ("Elias realized this translocation was no curse but a gift").

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose achieves moments of evocative clarity ("waves whispered secrets to the veiled ridgeway") but suffers from repetitive constructions and synonym loops around key concepts (traverse/traversed appears 5 times, "gently persistent" 4 times). Several sentences restate similar content without adding pressure. The opening and closing lines effectively bookend with transformed imagery, but middle sections contain scaffolding phrases that reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("choir family scattered like notes on wind") with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, abstract phrases like "seraphically mundane" and "frostbitten hope" create opacity, while some passages contain mild redundancy ("fragile melody hummed in his chest, unspoken yet alive"). The filtering through "cobalt" repetition works as pattern but occasionally dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose has moments of strong imagery but suffers from occasional overwriting ("the pause of shifting constellations" repeated, abstract phrases like "fractured the balance of the cosmos"). Some template cadence in the message-placing sequence. Information density is moderate with some passages doing single duty. Minor issues with abstract rather than concrete language in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.6)
    Multiple prose artifacts damage momentum: the awkward meta-commentary about word count ("Actually, recalibrating narrative for precision"), repetitive "moored/drifting" usage (7 instances), and template phrases like "Hours blurred as she worked." The paraphrase loop about paths disappearing/vanishing/erasing occurs across multiple paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with mixed metaphors ("thunderous serenity," "fires banked," "thunder muffled in silk") and elevated diction that obscures rather than clarifies. Template phrases appear throughout ("driven by an unyielding motivation," "pregnant with the need"). The bracketed word-count commentary and phrase "But wait, that exceeded—trimming back in mind" reveals unrevised generation artifacts that severely damage the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("Her rebellion, once armed with fire, now bloomed with purpose" restates the transformation), and template phrases like "Heart pounding" and "Eyes narrowed" lack specificity. The closing contains mild scaffold with abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose shows strong moments ("shrapnel like confetti from hell") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts—"pearl of stillness" appears 6 times, "optimism anchored in realism" 3 times. Some filter-verb stacks dull immediacy ("She recalled how..."). The template cadence penalty applies (-0.4) for repeated "She [verb]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant overwriting throughout: "crestfallen spirit ached with a luminescent glow," "walls seemed to close in with the rising tide's relentless murmur," multiple abstract compounds like "consensus reality." The prose reaches for literary effect through stacked modifiers and conceptual abstractions rather than precise, embodied language, creating opacity especially in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("shadows devoured the sun," "ephemeral patterns that twisted like living script") but suffers from repetitive constructions and the egregious meta-commentary about word count that destroys the story's final momentum. Multiple filter-verb clusters ("Elara traced," "sensing they were," "she retrieved") diminish immediacy in action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong moments ("the library's echoes seemed to hold their breath") but suffers from density issues - nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Several template constructions appear ("She had always been... but now"), and abstract phrases like "bravely conflicted" and "dizzying quiet" repeat without evolution. The writing maintains clarity but could benefit from selective pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clear and rhythmically varied prose with sophisticated imagery. However, dense figurative language in most sentences creates overwriting, particularly with repeated abstract phrases like "tranquil blaze" and "engraved quiet." Some register drift toward overly literary diction in high-pressure beats reduces immediacy and threatens to obscure the concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, particularly in the sensory-rich opening. Some abstract phrasing ("divine remnant whispered in legends," "articulation of the voids between notes") creates mild opacity. The figurative language generally coheres, though "sleepwalking constellations" bleeding "like ink in water" mixes vehicles slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.6)
    Multiple prose artifacts weaken momentum: "whose empire of ink and headlines spanned continents" reads as template biography; "velvet sky" and "silver sentinel" are stock descriptors; the parenthetical word-count tracking disrupts flow. The phrase "orbits of regret" appears four times without evolving meaning. Paragraph lengths lack variety, creating visual monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.7)
    Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but several instances of ornate phrasing slow momentum ("a hush as profound as a meteor's silent descent"). The phrase "time folded in on itself" appears three times, creating a mild loop, and some metaphors strain clarity ("the lab's acoustics, a baby's cry twisting through the folds of time").

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose achieves moments of vivid specificity ("fingers stained with pastel hues," "tile flake tucked into her pocket, where it hummed"), repetitive constructions appear ("Elara's whimsical," "Elara smiled whimsically") and abstract phrases like "emergent hush" and "lilac unease" recur without variation. Template cadence in "for the elder... for the youth" section creates predictable rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.6)
    Some elegant phrasing ("jagged fissures wept auroras of ash") but periodic overwriting with abstract conceptual language ("gentle radical," "warm coldness"). Template cadence appears in the ritual sequence ("She saw... She renamed... She spoke..."). Information density is good but occasional paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("no longer fully trapped, her retrocognition a tool now, not chains" restates the transformation).

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery like "Lanterns strung like fireflies swayed gently, casting patterns that danced across Eliza's vision in soft, nostalgic indigo." Minor issues with abstract phrasing ("possibilities flickered like fireflies—new stages, revived troupes") and some density in the middle section where multiple metaphors cluster without advancing action.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("trails of colored LEDs danced across canvas like fireflies in a jar") but suffers from scattered template phrases and mild overwriting. Several paraphrase loops appear ("somatic awareness, those subtle bodily signals") and register occasionally drifts academic, dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax, though several instances of elevated diction clash with immediacy ("post-slumber epoch," "inextricable from the earth's own pulse"). Information density is high, but the final paragraph contains summary-mode telling that diminishes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously. However, abstract phrasing ("raw possibilities," "unearthed silence") appears frequently without concrete embodiment, and some metaphoric vehicles strain coherence (buttons as both "threads" and "mosaic").

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. However, several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("vouchsafe her presence," "convergence") and the metaphor density in places like "earth tilting toward bloom" edges toward purple prose. The writing sustains momentum despite these ornamental moments.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.9)
    Significant overwriting issues include dense figurative language ("spindrift serenity," "fog clung like a reluctant lover") and the final section's repetitive template cadence ("Elias smiled... Travelers ahead would find... And so..."). The paraphrase loop around the palimpsest concept and synonym churn ("distill/percolate/essence") further weaken momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("thorny blooms slicing the twilight with precise beauty"), but several instances of abstract phrasing weaken immediacy: "quiet thrum of sustained compassion," "will to resist his own unraveling." The "phototropic" repetition works as pattern but the kindness-as-light metaphor gets stretched. Information density is high and paragraph rhythm varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose achieves moments of strong rhythm ("each stroke deliberate, pulling her deeper into reflection"), several passages suffer from abstract phrasing and mild overwriting—"the kind where the world holds its breath, suspended between wave and whisper" strains for effect. Some paraphrase loops appear ("quivering hush" restated multiple times) and figurative density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows with varied syntax and strong imagery, though several overwrought phrases strain clarity ("atomically reflective quality, mirroring not just light but the very quanta of reality"). Template cadence appears in the "She [verb]" pattern across paragraphs 6-8. Information density remains high with most sentences advancing multiple story functions.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like the opening's vivid imagery but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "prismatic quiet" (appears 3 times) and "thread that connects all things" (appears 3 times). Some sentences reach for elevated register that dulls momentum: "inevitably whimsical energy, as if the lilies themselves conspired in gentle jests." Information density is moderate with some redundant emotional labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without payoff ("fragile as starlight on fogged glass," "ethereal pull," "gritty symphony"). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("protesters rubbing their temples," "Harlan staggered back, clutching his head"). Mixed metaphors clash (stars as both "whispers" and "tricksters playing games"). The final image achieves clarity but earlier passages bog down in ornamental description.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades peak moments: "lover's embrace turned vise," "wistful melody fueled her inner mutiny," "defiant harmony against confinement" stack figurative language without clear vehicles. Template cadence appears in "She paused...She grasped...She ascended" structure. Mixed metaphors muddle clarity: spaces have "veins," engage in "mutiny," and "weep for liberation" without coherent logic.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive overwriting with stacked modifiers ("mist-shrouded pit," "hesitant lance," "deliberate care") and template constructions weaken momentum. Repetitive phrasing appears throughout: "Elara's portraits... Elara's sketch... Elara turned back." The phrase "unifying opposites" and variants appear six times, creating conceptual loops. Mixed metaphors ("lance the case's heart") and abstract formulations ("empathy's lens") replace concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.5)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structures. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for: "spongey dread" appearing twice (-0.4), abstract phrasing like "tentative hope" in closure paragraph (-0.3), and slightly overwrought metaphors ("barnacle on dying whale," "etched the sky in jagged permanence") that accumulate (-0.5).

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose achieves moments of strong lyricism ("jagged peaks pierced the sky like forgotten promises") but suffers from occasional overwrought metaphors and abstract conceptual language around "pixelated amnesty." Some paraphrase loops appear ("bridge-song fiddler" concept restated multiple ways). Information density is high and the final image lands cleanly, preventing lower scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression, with effective images like "money's exotic hues catching the light." However, repetitive phrase structures appear ("Elias felt...," "Elias chose...," "Elias approached...") and the abstract final line about "harmonizing echoes" dulls what should be a sharp closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dense figurative language appears in most sentences ("hushed embrace," "canopy of twinkling stars," "midnight solace wrapping around her") without serving accumulative pressure. Multiple mixed metaphors muddle clarity: stars as "beacons" then "chroniclers," the telegram as both "relic" and "lantern." Template cadence runs through "She witnessed... She reached out... She unfolded" structures.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant overwriting issues pervade, particularly stacked modifiers ("twisted apple branches spun like silent warriors in eternal drill") and abstract descriptors ("warlike serenity," "serene deception"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear (the unbending is described redundantly across several paragraphs). Template cadence emerges in the "She [verb]" constructions. Information density suffers from ornamental phrases that don't advance story.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between description and action. Some repetitive phrasing around "anxious elation" and "purposeful curiosity" creates minor loops. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story functions, though occasional abstract phrases like "intersection of dreams" could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("roots snaked between bleached bones like veins feeding on the dead") but suffers from repetitive phrasing—"inlaying meaning everywhere" appears three times, "fiercely gentle" twice. Template cadence runs appear in sequential "She [verb]" constructions. The final image lands cleanly, though middle sections contain paraphrase loops around the bartering concept.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm shifts and strong opening/closing images. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "vast archive, waiting for someone to listen to its stories" strains the metaphor, and phrases like "faltering pulse" and "tactile promise" push toward purple prose. The reflection-to-action ratio also creates some momentum drag in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several passages suffer from abstract density and register drift: "energies dispersing yet reconverging in higher dimensions" and "biological imprint of quantum leaps from corporeal to spectral" blur clarity without advancing pressure. Template constructions appear ("She longed to understand," "She envisioned," "She planted") creating mechanical rhythm. The prose achieves moments of beauty but overreaches with stacked abstractions that obscure rather than illuminate, particularly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose achieves moments of genuine beauty, it suffers from density overload—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without sufficient breathing room. Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle clarity ("smelted it—not with fire, but through alchemical acceptance"). The piece would benefit from strategic simplification to let key images resonate. Template cadence appears in the middle section with repetitive "he [verb]" structures.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, but several instances of overwriting dilute impact: "resonant hush" appears twice, abstract phrases like "entropy," "latent radiance" lack concrete grounding. The filter-verb cluster ("he felt it," "Elias noticed," "he brought it") in the discovery sequence dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from overwriting with dense figurative language ("ivy tendrils that curled like accusing fingers," "veins of green blood") and repetitive constructions ("daringly methodical" appears three times). Template cadence emerges in parallel structures, and several paraphrase loops weaken momentum, particularly in the reflection-heavy passages.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence variety and rhythm generally work, though some overwrought metaphors strain clarity ("petals of a nocturnal flower" for the cipher). Multiple instances of template phrasing appear ("she felt," "she stepped," "she ventured") and abstract descriptors like "latent energy" and "ambient hush" lack specificity. The prose is competent but occasionally relies on atmosphere over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity and varied sentence structures. However, several instances of abstract conceptual phrasing ("propagate destinies," "perforated path," "communal bloom") create opacity. Some synonym churning around destiny/fate/path concepts. The elevated register occasionally tips into purple prose territory.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density high - most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or plot simultaneously. Deductions for repetitive phrasing ("radiant hush" appears 4 times, "threshold of stillness" 3 times) and occasional overwriting in figurative language ("veils of green and violet," "silken veils").

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from ornamental density—"the vineyard hush of ripened secrets and silent vines" adds texture without advancing story. Template repetition appears in "Kindly decisive, Elara" (used 3x) and conceptual loops like "committed caretaker"/"caretaker eternal." The paraphrase loop "finding peace in the hush that followed" after "contentment bloomed in acceptance" weakens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("brisk breeze swept up from the sea") but suffers from overwriting in figurative language—nearly every beat contains metaphorical description that occasionally obscures clarity. The final meta-commentary about word count is a critical artifact that breaks immersion. Template phrases like "wrapped around her shoulders like an unwelcome cloak" and "fog" metaphor for confusion feel stock.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from abstract density ("threads of time," "dissolution into nothingness," "ethereal proof") and repetitive mystical phrasing. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "vanishing to appear" concept restated without advancement across paragraphs 4, 10, 17, 20, 23. Template rhythm in "She [verb], [abstract noun phrase]" dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery. However, abstract phrases like "harmonic stone skimmer" and "weathered resolve" appear multiple times without clarification, and some elevated diction ("inexorably," "cataclysmic") creates occasional opacity. The text maintains momentum despite these moments of abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive abstraction and synonym loops weaken line-level execution: "brilliant dimness"/"brilliant in its dim"/"dim brilliance" repeat without adding meaning. Template cadence appears in "She believed...She sensed...she resolved" constructions. The phrase "underachieving" appears 7 times without variation, creating mechanical repetition rather than purposeful pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("bubbles trailed like unspoken words") with strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. However, several phrases repeat unnecessarily ("luminous vows" appears 4 times, "meteor hush" 3 times), and some metaphors strain clarity ("the tag clutched like a compass"). The final lines land with appropriate resonance despite these minor redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("coins clinking like distant echoes"), though occasional overwriting appears ("wavelength align with her purpose, to tune her essence to the harmonic frequency"). Some abstract phrasing ("quiet enthusiasm," "stellar doubt") repeats without sufficient variation, creating minor template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("hesitant fireflies," "forgotten moons") and occasional register elevation. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but phrases like "distant intimacy" and "fragile closeness" edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic variation and purposeful imagery, though figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("first light fracturing through its crystalline arches like hesitant promises"). Some conceptual repetition occurs with "brittle devotion" and variants of "lukewarm" without adding pressure. The dripping sequence effectively varies sentence structure to match the methodical timing work, and technical clarity remains strong throughout despite occasional overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft shows competence with varied sentence structures and atmospheric precision. Repetitive use of "precisely humane" (3x) creates mild template cadence. Some purple moments ("velvet black of night," "twilight bled") border on overwriting but don't obscure clarity. The "mirrored hush" motif effectively bookends without feeling forced.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the ritual sequence. Information density high in descriptive passages. However, multiple instances of elevated register ("cosmic alchemy," "elusive whispers," "symphony of patterns") create mild overwriting, and phrases like "ancient freshness" appear four times. The "alchemy of the soul" line particularly weakens the otherwise strong closing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum through the crisis moment. Strong specificity in technical details (bio-steel branches, solar fabric leaves, signal amplifier). Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "watcher's burden" (appears 4 times), some abstract constructions ("suffocating weight of solitary judgment"), and occasional overwriting in descriptive passages that slightly slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Good sentence variety and information density, with most lines serving multiple functions. However, the prose trends purple with stacked modifiers and elevated diction ("ethereal expanse above the shattered remnants"). Some repetitive phrasing around "opposites" and overwrought figurative language that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.3)
    Repetitive phrasing weakens momentum: "storm-born silence" appears four times, "notably receptive" three times, "safeguarding space for innovation" twice verbatim. Template cadence runs through "He decided...He planted...He envisioned." These loops and the abstract "across the hush of a possibility just born" construction that repeats blur precision.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose tends toward purple with "ghostly chorus that lingered like unspoken regrets" and similar constructions appearing frequently. The metaphorical density occasionally obscures clarity, particularly in "tangled mass of thorny vines, symbols of the unspoken barbs." Information density is high but sometimes at clarity's expense.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Through the veil of sleep" appears three times). Template cadence in middle sections ("She nosed it free...She envisioned...She decided"). Information density high when describing sensory detail but some paraphrase loops around the homesickness concept detract.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose displays strong imagery but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats contains figurative language without pattern-teaching payoff. Template cadence appears in the experimental sequence ("First, he heated... Nothing... Undeterred... Again, he refined..."). The overwriting particularly affects momentum in crucial transformation moments. Clear spatial choreography and varied sentence structure provide partial mitigation.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves solid clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. However, several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("felled by some ancient catastrophe," "nomadic fleets") and the phrase "serenely electric" appears twice, creating unnecessary repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several purple patches strain clarity ("stars above blurred into a spectral grotto below, its cavernous walls glowing with ethereal light") and the rushed pacing compresses complex action into run-on sentences. The phrase "permanent transient" appears forced as oxymoronic description rather than organic to scene.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments like "sinew thread—harvested from forgotten anatomies, tough and alive with the ghost of muscle memory" but suffers from occasional density overload and abstract phrasing. Some sentences strain under modifier weight ("realistically imaginary—ethereal yet grounded"), and phrases like "texture of connection" repeat without variation. The elevated register occasionally obscures rather than illuminates.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.6)
    Several template phrases recur ("somber marvel" appears 6 times, "balanced/balancedly curious" 4 times) creating repetitive cadence. The prose suffers from abstract telling ("the weight of isolation," "newfound purpose") and filter-verb clusters ("she felt," "she pondered," "she knew"). While individual sentences are grammatically clean, information density is low with multiple paragraphs restating the same concepts about edge geometry and starlight navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine atmosphere but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence carries figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Mixed metaphors appear ("emotional contagion" alongside heart rhythms), and phrases like "reeling hush" repeat without evolution, creating ornamental rather than functional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant overwriting throughout with stacked modifiers ("corroded panels and tangled wires, remnants of experiments"), abstract metaphors ("weight of the ocean pressing down like an unyielding whisper"), and repetitive phrasing around the "crashing hush." The prose often tells what it just showed, particularly around Elias's claustrophobia. Information density is moderate but could be much tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and atmospheric phrases like "the radio's persistent static finally cleared into a hush of open airwaves." However, several paraphrase loops appear ("steadied to a serene sixty, the midnight solace deepening" essentially restates calm twice), and abstract descriptors like "quiet determination" and "meaningful tightening" lack specificity. The phrase "life's rhythm restored" feels templated.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves strong imagery but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without sufficient breathing room. Mixed metaphors appear ("diamond's flaw catching light like a trapped scream" conflates visual and auditory). Some overwrought phrases ("chaotic ballet," "strata of forgotten time") and repetitive constructions around texture/echo imagery create mild monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("cracking ice over hopeful waters") but suffers from occasional overwriting - "frost-kissed" appears twice, and phrases like "the harmony untamed revealed itself" lean purple. Template cadence appears in "She metamorphosed... She stepped... She clutched." Information density is generally good but some scaffolding remains.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from repetitive "resonantly soft" (3x) and template cadence in action sequences ("They began to uproot... Twigs snapped, metal groaned..."). Mixed metaphors appear ("sky-bridge woven from vines and starlight" clashes with physical playing), and filter constructions accumulate in peak moments, dulling immediacy despite some strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("shadows lengthened across the arcade's mosaic floors") but suffers from density issues with metaphorical language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff. Phrases like "brittle hush" repeat without evolution, and some constructions strain clarity ("fostering bonds that the drones of surveillance couldn't sever" uses abstract nouns where concrete action would strengthen).

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with vivid phrases like "faded posters peeled like forgotten dreams" and maintains momentum through varied sentence structures. However, several passages contain near-paraphrase loops ("misting hush"/"soft fog"/"ethereal quiet" cluster) and some metaphors strain clarity ("inside the chime of wind bells" as temporal marker). The writing leans heavily on atmospheric accumulation, occasionally at the expense of precision.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("scholars debating entropy's rhyme"). Some elevated diction in peak moments ("veiled intimacy," "cosmic lyre") creates mild register drift, and occasional template cadence appears ("She believed...She traced...She saw") though momentum largely sustains through varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information-dense prose with strong moments ("developing the negative in a darkroom carved from the cliff"), but overwriting appears in metaphor-heavy passages. Template phrases like "vitalizing her days" and "luminous absence" repeat without variation, and abstract constructions ("the hush of improbable beginnings") occasionally obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.6)
    Overwriting pervades with abstract descriptors ("hush of cosmic possibility," "boundless connection," "cosmic reunion") and repetitive cosmic/shadow/star imagery. Template phrases like "Elara gasped," "Elara nodded," "Elara felt" create mechanical transitions. The prose prioritizes atmospheric accumulation over clear action, with vague spatial markers ("stepped into a alcove") and abstract emotional states reducing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentences vary in length and structure, creating readable rhythm. Several evocative images land well ("coracle through the shallows," "mossy stones"). However, abstract phrases like "decades' worth of loss" and "crisp, nostalgic instant" lack concrete specificity, and some metaphors strain ("memories...pilfered not by thieves but by time's indifferent tide").

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic variation and purposeful paragraph structure, with effective sentence-level propulsion in action beats. However, figurative density overwhelms several passages—"steam rising like whispers from the graves of forgotten dreams" stacks metaphors unnecessarily. Template phrases appear ("coil in her gut," "cornered animal") and some paraphrase loops occur around the exile concept, though the closure image lands cleanly without ornamental interference.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variety and purposeful paragraph structure, with evocative phrases like "cascade of growth—blossoms unfurling in hues of impossible wonder." However, figurative density is excessive in peak beats without pattern-teaching ("insatiably creative fire," "tendrils seeking threads," "rivers of liquid light" in rapid succession). Some phrases like "radiant hush" appear multiple times, creating mild repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("Each knot released a hush that filled the air") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrases. "Lucid unrest" appears three times, creating unnecessary repetition. Some metaphors strain ("memories like fractured memories"). Information density is generally good, with most sentences advancing the ritual or emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive constructions ("Elias traced," "Elias cross-referenced," "Elias stepped") and abstract emotional descriptors ("empathetic weight," "shielded openness"). Several paraphrase loops appear (father's quest described multiple ways). Information density is moderate—most sentences advance plot but some reiterate established facts. The meta-commentary about word count disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clear prose with beautiful imagery, but significant overwriting issues. Dense figurative language in most sentences of high-pressure beats without clear payoff, purple prose tendencies, and repetitive elevated diction. Phrases like "sophisticated melancholy" and "melancholic undercurrents of discovery" create register drift that clashes with natural narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and visual paragraph breaks, avoiding monotony. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously. Overwriting appears in peak moments ("binary blooms that hid pleas for connection") with −0.5 for density; template cadence emerges in "She... She... Her fingers..." sequence with −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe overwriting pervades: "ascending servant, chosen from the lower decks of the cloud-city for her unyielding poise" could be "ascending servant chosen for her poise." Template constructions repeat ("By the fifth floor," "Sixth floor," "Seventh floor," "Eighth"). The single-paragraph wall and multiple mixed metaphors (light as whispers, runes blooming as frost flowers) create opacity. The self-correction about floor counting ("No, she corrected inwardly...But recalibrating her count") breaks flow artificially.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.7)
    Generally strong rhythmic control and atmospheric density. However, repetitive phrasing appears ("dusty starlight," "spooled wholeness," "quietly explosive") and some metaphorical density borders on overwrought. Information density is good but occasional clarity issues arise. The accumulative structure justifies some repetition, but execution could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.8)
    Repetitive use of "fractal/fractally" (17 instances) creates template cadence that dulls impact. Phrases like "heightened stillness" appear 3 times verbatim, and "discovering limits" recurs mechanically. Several paraphrase loops exist: "faces dissolved into anonymity, a limit she had long accepted yet chafed against" restates rather than advances. These artifacts accumulate to reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose flows smoothly but suffers from ornate phrasing ("starling murmurations danced like living inkblots") and repetitive structure. Filter phrases like "Elara felt" and "she realized" dull immediacy in key discovery moments. The text lacks the propulsion needed for stronger engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied syntax and strong imagery ("crystalline fortress," "frozen tears"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in middle section ("She pushed...she wandered...") and occasional abstraction ("deeper ache," "quiet repairs") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and rhythm. Some overwriting appears ("brambles of despair," "thorny, resilient, and eternally entwined") but doesn't obscure clarity. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance story though some border on ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades with abstract metaphors ("bruised awe" appears 4 times, "hush" 7 times) and elevated diction that obscures clarity. Template patterns emerge in "She had found it... She traced them... She leaned closer..." constructions. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over propulsion, creating momentum drag especially in the visions paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from overwriting with mixed metaphors ("shadows that danced like awkward lovers"), unnecessary modifiers, and the jarring meta-commentary about word count that breaks the fictional dream entirely. Some strong images exist ("brass wings glinting," "crystallizing the paths into slippery graves") but density issues and the bracketed artifacts significantly harm momentum. Template cadence appears in "She began... She traced... She moved."

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied syntax, though metaphors accumulate densely ("symphonically minded," "braided ravine," "foam patterns," "chrysalis") without always advancing pressure. Some filter-heavy passages ("She thought of," "She described") dull immediacy during key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("counter carved from petrified fog") but suffers from density issues - figurative language appears in most sentences without always advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the incision sequence ("She incised... Elara incised..."). Some abstract phrasing ("integrated fragmentation," "mindfully scattered") creates opacity. -0.6 for density without payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("sandpaper those rough memories smooth," "festering in her palate") and purple constructions ("fleeting promise," "unspoken dream"). Template cadence appears in the pavilion sequence with repetitive "she [verb]" structures. The prose achieves moments of clarity but stumbles through ornamental density.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm and varied sentence structure, with purposeful repetition of "under the hush of borrowed starlight" bookending the piece. Information density is high. However, several instances of elevated diction feel forced ("vigorous tenderness," "empathetically decisive"), and there's occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages that reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but overwriting pervades: "shadows twisted like forgotten helixes," "quaking tremor that blurred his vision." Mixed metaphors appear ("canyon's vast canyon"). Template phrasing emerges in "He saw them clearly now" followed by exposition. The prose achieves moments of clarity but stumbles on ornate figurative language that occasionally obscures rather than illuminates.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    Overwriting pervades with phrases like "latent blaze," "clandestinely luminous," and "seeds of vigilance" repeated as labels rather than evolving meanings. Template cadence appears in "Elara's fingers... Elara's heart... Elara's motivation..." structure. Clear progression and serviceable prose, but the figurative density ("fire in her veins," "testament to the vigilance") dulls rather than sharpens key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good information density, though some metaphorical density in high-pressure beats ("empathy itself in motion—fluid, connecting her pulse"). Minor template cadence in "She strummed again" followed by "Elowen strummed on" but maintains momentum through varied sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("the sky bruising into purples and golds") but suffers from abstract repetition of "beauty in the difficult" and some overwrought metaphor. Template cadence appears in middle section ("Elias closed his eyes...He correlated them..."). Information density is moderate; several passages could compress without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong vocabulary and varied syntax but suffers from overwriting in places - "intuitively descriptive" appears twice as awkward modifier chains, and metaphors occasionally strain ("ember" for motivation). Some passages achieve beautiful rhythm ("tears welled in his eyes, the words intuitively descriptive of grief's layered quietudes") while others feel overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    Overwriting pervades key beats: "colossal oaks intertwined like ancient lovers," "dark sunrise," "symphony she danced within." Template cadence appears in "As days blurred...Elara prepared...The treetop world moved on." The prose prioritizes ornamental description over propulsion, with multiple paraphrase loops around the same concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clean, propulsive prose with good momentum through the inversion sequence. Some mild redundancy ("whirling silence" appears four times) and occasional overwriting ("auditory ghosts, revealing paths obscured"), but information density remains high and the action choreography tracks clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density high in technical passages. Deducting for repetitive constructions ("Elias + verb" pattern appears frequently) and some overwriting in atmospheric descriptions ("forgotten monoliths under a shrouded sky").

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.7)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing atmosphere, character perception, or plot. However, several instances of ornate phrasing obscure clarity ("oscillating repose," "synesthetically blessed") and some conceptual repetition occurs around the sculpted hush concept. The prose occasionally prioritizes lyricism over momentum, particularly in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong moments of clarity and rhythm appear in lines like "the silence so profound it buried her footsteps like an unseen avalanche of hush." However, the prose suffers from repetitive use of "avalanchingly quiet" (4 instances), abstract phrasing like "harvested insights" that appears multiple times, and occasional overwriting in the vision sequence. The compound modifier "avalanchingly" feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm, particularly in the climactic paragraph where short questions punctuate longer descriptive passages. Some figurative density in peak moments ("lucid turbulence," "fractured rainbows," "turbulent flow") approaches overwriting without pattern-teaching. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Multiple instances of repetitive phrasing ("vibrating sympathetically" appears 3 times, "coax wonder from the routine" twice, "germinating" variants). These loops and some overwriting in metaphorical passages ("aurora-born heroes") reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    The meta-commentary at the end ("Wait, that's over—let me adjust for exact count...") creates significant line-level debt. Some repetitive phrasing and template constructions throughout. Otherwise, prose has good rhythm and atmospheric density, but these artifacts harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant overwriting issues pervade the text with dense figurative language in nearly every sentence ("raveling silence," "hushed and inexorable," "stoically sparkling"), creating prose opacity that slows momentum. Template repetition of "wistful," "stoically sparkling," and "raveling silence" across multiple beats triggers the pattern-artifact penalty, though the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dense figurative language appears in most sentences ("shadows dappling," "chunks of stone plummeted like forgotten dreams," "whispered defiance") without clear pattern or payoff, creating overwriting density (-0.7). Template cadence in "Elowen watched...Elowen emerged...Elowen returned" structure (-0.5). The prose achieves atmosphere but sacrifices momentum to ornamental description.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally flows well with varied sentence structures and clear imagery. However, some repetitive phrasing appears ("cyclically spontaneous" used 6 times, "dream-murmur" 4 times) that could be varied. The opening and closing lines effectively bracket the story, though some middle sections contain slight redundancy in describing the parallel universes.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery—"smooth pebbles balanced in a deliberate spiral"—but suffers from abstract phrasing like "luminescent ache" appearing multiple times and "bottled essence of safety" that muddles concrete meaning. Long sentences occasionally lose momentum, particularly the 89-word sentence describing the stone stack discovery. The final image lands effectively despite these periodic density issues.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades with dense figurative language in nearly every sentence ("salt-kissed winds," "frozen bolt of lightning," "serpents in the night") without clear pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears in repetitive "He [verb]" constructions, and several paraphrase loops weaken momentum, particularly around the shadow-steering sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs—"The structure, a colossal boulder hollowed by ancient winds and tethered by vines" establishes setting while suggesting transformation. However, several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("god Arcturus," "sun maps from forgotten astronomers") and some metaphor density in peak beats reduces clarity ("quietly explosive truth settling in her chest"). No major loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong rhythmic control and varied syntax, but figurative density overwhelms in places—nearly every sentence contains metaphor or simile. Template cadence appears ("Elias lifted...Elias carried...Elias sketched...Elias saw...Elias smiled"). The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("moonlight slicing through roiling clouds") but overwriting diminishes momentum, particularly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant overwriting pervades the piece with purple prose like "veins of silver that pulsed like forgotten heartbeats" appearing in most sentences. The bracketed meta-commentary creates severe artifacts. Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs, and abstract descriptors ("harmonious renewal") replace concrete imagery at crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several instances of synonym churn weaken momentum: "shadowed alcoves cradled paradoxes nestled one within another" and repetitive use of "paradox/paradoxical" (6 instances). Template cadence appears in "Elias descended, staying above in body... but leaving in spirit." Information density varies, with some passages achieving strong compression while others rely on abstract descriptors like "enlarged tranquility" without concrete anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but "heuristically gentle" appears twice verbatim and some overwriting occurs ("morning mist," "skittish child"). Abstract philosophizing about normality could be more concretely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades with stacked modifiers ("gently meticulous nature a quiet anchor amid the shifting veils") and abstract metaphors that obscure concrete action. Template phrasing appears in "she moved through...with deliberate grace" and "her mind weaving patterns"—stock constructions that dilute specificity. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over clarity, particularly in peak moments where "recalibrating to infuse frequencies with stabilizing echoes" abstracts the crucial action.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose artifacts significantly harm momentum: the meta-commentary about word count, the forced "sound of trust breaking" metaphor repeated abstractly, and overwritten phrases like "comforting unease" that appear multiple times. The actual/adjusted word count notation breaks immersion entirely. Some strong sensory writing exists but is undermined by these scaffold elements.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.9)
    The meta-commentary disruption ("But wait, that's over—recalibrate") severely damages the ending's coherence. Multiple false endings and word-count anxiety create severe momentum loss. Some elegant phrases exist but are undermined by the self-conscious editorial intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows moments of beauty ("crystals casting auroral sorrow across its pages") but suffers from overwriting—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching. Template phrases like "triumphant surrender to the inevitable" and repetitive "auroral sorrow" diminish momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("colossal panes of fogged glass arched over labyrinthine walkways"), some filter verb clusters ("she believed," "she realized," "she found"), and slight template phrasing in the discovery sequence. Information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "bells swaying in orchestrated chaos," but several issues accumulate: repetition of "muted vigor" and "glisten" weakens precision, and abstract phrases like "color of wonder" lack concrete grounding. The template-like progression of visitor transformations (approach, listen, transform) creates predictable cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is generally strong with varied sentence structures, but template cadence appears in the resolution sequence ("Elias moved on...," "He gazed...," "He paused..."). Some paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("fragmented wholeness" concept restated multiple times), and the extended denouement dilutes the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from overwriting: "vibrant courtyard at dawn where the community gathered like dew-kissed flowers" and similar flourishes slow momentum. Template phrases like "that old companion" and "silent sentinel" reduce freshness. The extended metaphors ("sandstorm calm unbroken—steady as dunes shifting") muddle rather than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose shows strong moments of poetic compression and imagery, but suffers from overwriting in places—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Template phrases like "as a spider spins its web" repeat without sufficient variation. Some metaphors strain clarity ("lyrical traditions of old poets who hid revolutions in rhyme"), and there's occasional register drift into abstraction that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("its massive form crashing against the docks in a final, shuddering sigh") but suffers from occasional overwriting and register drift. Phrases like "earth's quiet hoard" and "echoes in amber" feel performatively literary. Some template cadence appears in the middle section with repetitive "he/his" constructions, though the closure sequence maintains cleaner propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery, but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff. Phrases like "whispered secrets," "tranquil blaze," and "terrestrially cosmic" risk purple prose. The meta-commentary about word count breaks immersion completely.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose tends toward overwriting with stacked metaphors ("steam from Earl Grey mingled with the scent of aged books and wax") and abstract formulations ("mysterious familiarity blooming into confession"). Several paraphrase loops appear ("agreed upon lies, polite fictions"). The meteor shower description maintains atmosphere but "silent symphony" strains coherence. Line-level control wavers between vivid specificity and purple abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.3)
    Several template patterns weaken the prose: "Elara [verb]" constructions dominate, creating rhythmic monotony. Overwriting appears in stacked modifiers ("charmed skeptic," "tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve"). The metaphorical system around "resonance structures" and "vibrational alignments" lacks clarity, reading more as mystical hand-waving than concrete mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("wisely enduring" appears 5 times, "pearl twilight" 6 times) that dulls impact. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("She had forged... she had wisely endured...") and several paraphrase loops restate rather than advance ("calibrated treason into forgiveness, enduring wisely to embrace").

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("progressively disclosing," "richly perceptive" appears multiple times) and abstract language that dulls immediacy. The meta-commentary at the end ("Wait, that's over—let me adjust") breaks immersion entirely, though some passages achieve lyrical momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in passages like "carved deep into the frozen monolith, the shrine's walls gleamed with veins of blue ice." Information density remains high as most lines advance both atmosphere and plot. However, some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("burned like the candles' flames") and occasional abstract phrasing ("unspoken bonds that had sustained the crew") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates control with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "scintillatingly somber" fireflies "like tears sparkling on a mourner's cheek" stacks figurative language unnecessarily. Template phrases like "demure audacity" repeat verbatim. The philosophical register occasionally drifts into abstraction that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant text artifacts severely damage the prose: "But wait, that's over—adjusting," "[600-800 achieved in core...]" and similar drafting commentary. Beyond artifacts, density issues create opacity ("forensic mosaic," overwrought constructions). Information moves the story forward but clarity suffers under the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant repetition issues damage momentum: "variant allegiances" appears 7 times, "cobalt portico" 6 times, creating template-cadence problems. Sentences like "Elias smiled, the lonely visionary who had shaped it all" and the subsequent three fragments read as scaffold rather than purposeful rhythm. Mixed metaphors ("fireflies in the static") and overwriting in peak moments further reduce clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose tends toward overwriting with stacked modifiers ("positively wistful" appears three times) and elevated diction that occasionally obscures clarity. Some metaphors strain ("symphony of gleaned redemption that sweetened the air"). Information density is high but the ornate style sometimes impedes momentum, particularly in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe overwriting pervades with purple prose like "fleshly ethereal dance of protection and adaptation" and mixed metaphors (ice as "nomadic ghosts," water's "hesitant breaths"). Template cadence appears in repetitive "Elias [verb]" constructions and synonym churn around the artifact's properties. The prose prioritizes ornamental description over clarity and momentum, with abstract philosophizing ("sonic absolution—the core concept that had haunted Elias's dreams") replacing concrete action in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("silver thread weaving through the stars") but suffers from occasional purple patches and abstract phrasing. Template cadence appears in middle sections ("One by one, they..." "Days blurred into weeks..."). The opening and closing sentences effectively bookend with strong imagery, though some middle passages lose propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose density works in places ("flashlight cutting through the humid gloom like a hesitant blade") but suffers from repetitive constructions and overwrought metaphors. "Watchfully calm" appears twice verbatim; "empirical observation" three times; "controlling influence" twice; "entangled memories" twice; "fortified vulnerability" twice. The template pattern of trait-phrases weakens momentum, and several sentences could be compressed without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("dust motes danced in slanted beams") but suffers from occasional overwriting and repetition of key phrases ("aptly deliberate" appears three times, "vibrant hush" twice). Some metaphors strain ("clockwork heart pulsing with brass veins"), though line-level control generally serves the meditative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery. However, some phrases edge toward purple prose ("churning haze," "whispering brass"), and there's occasional template cadence in the transliteration sequence. Information density is high, with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though some metaphors strain ("fetus in brass womb").

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant template cadence issues: "Elara [verb]" structures dominate, creating monotonous rhythm. Multiple paraphrase loops appear ("crashed on Europa"/"debris field on Europa's icy crust"). Overreliance on abstract descriptors ("unquenchable motivation," "brightly attentive eyes") over concrete detail. The prose achieves clarity but lacks propulsion, with many sentences doing single jobs rather than layering information.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.6)
    Heavy overwriting burdens the prose: "shadow-laced peacekeeper," "weathered tower," "frost-kissed fruit" stack modifiers without precision. The bracketed meta-commentary about word count breaks immersion catastrophically. Template phrases like "heart pounding yet steady" and "armed with their stories woven into her own resolve" read as scaffold rather than crafted prose. The final confused addendum about word count adjustment severely damages professional presentation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong lyricism ("floes clattered like forgotten thoughts") but suffers from abstract phrasing ("reality slipped in her loose grip") and repetitive constructions around wind/solace imagery. The phrase "fold in patience" appears three times with diminishing returns. Information density is uneven, with some passages doing single rather than double duty.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("taillights fading into the twilight like a reluctant farewell") but suffers from periodic overwriting and abstract phrasing. Several instances of elevated diction clash with the rural setting ("intersubjective understanding," "inexorable pull"). Some sentences could be tightened—"the conversation unfolded with passionate subtlety, words flowing like the slow pour of aged wine" strains for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose tends toward overwriting with dense figurative language: "silken walls fluttering like breaths caught in eternal suspension" appears in nearly every paragraph. Some redundancy in describing the clearings and the echo multiple times with similar phrasing. The writing is competent but would benefit from selective pruning to increase momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant template cadence runs appear throughout ("She had come...," "She opened...," "She gathered...," "She began...," "She whispered..."). Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "piecing together the fragmented stories" followed immediately by photos as "puzzle piece in her subtle archive." The prose relies on abstract descriptors ("earnest whimsy," "perceptively calm," "whimsical fire") rather than concrete action, with filter-heavy constructions dulling immediacy ("Elara felt the field's magic stir").

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe overwriting issues pervade the text with abstract metaphors ("words as living entities," "wild, branching fractals") and repetitive thematic statements. Template cadence appears throughout ("Elias placed...," "Elias stepped...," "Elias testified..."). The phrase "suspended hush" recurs 7 times without evolving meaning. Information density is low—many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong imagery and rhythm but carries moderate density issues—"tidal longing" appears three times, "echoes"/"clinging to echoes" recurs, and some figurative language clusters heavily ("fog's embrace," "magnetic ghosts murmuring fragments"). Information density is good when describing concrete actions with driftwood and chalk.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.2)
    While individual sentences are well-crafted, there's significant overwriting in descriptive passages—"frost-rimmed windows," "silver-streaked beard," "polished obsidian eyes" pile up without advancing story. The prose tends toward ornamental metaphor ("girders groan like ancient bones") rather than clean propulsion. Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the "ephemeral" concept being restated multiple times.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    Several instances of overwriting appear: "decisively kind" repeated, "pulsing stillness" used three times, some purple moments ("glided through corridors," "eternal dawn"). Template phrasing surfaces ("As the serene hospice music therapist," "With each verse"). However, the prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("hope's fragrance lingered, a final, pulsing note in the stillness") and maintains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose clarity suffers from consistent overwriting and register drift, particularly in phrases like "sealed awakenings buried within the fabric of time itself" and "harmonize the world's fractured cycles." The text exhibits template cadence in repetitive "she [verb]" constructions and relies on abstract conceptual language over concrete imagery. Information density is moderate but momentum stalls during exposition-heavy passages about the runes and world mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive use of abstract concept-phrases ("nostalgic innovation" appears 5 times, "forgiving skeptic" 3 times) creating template cadence. Mixed metaphors muddle clarity ("mistakes into constellations," "cleft in certainty"). Several paraphrase loops occur, particularly in the closing paragraphs where similar sentiments repeat without added pressure. Information density is compromised by ornamental abstraction rather than concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts ("zephyr bloom" appears 5 times, "resurface" 6 times, "pearl of stillness" 3 times). Information density varies; some passages do multiple jobs while others loop concepts. Figurative language occasionally overwhelms clarity ("mist swirled like blooming petals"). No major grammar issues but sentence variety could improve.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without sufficient breathing room ("verdant moss garden where rusted servers cradled emerald cushions"). Template phrases like "quietly proactive grace" and "watchful dreamer" recur mechanically. The prose prioritizes ornamental description over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive overwriting with stacked modifiers ("feral nexus of the ancient coastal woods"), abstract descriptors ("swirling hush"), and repetitive phrasing ("against the current" appears 5 times, "lucidly watchful" 4 times). Template cadence in the cameo sections follows identical structure. The prose prioritizes atmospheric effect over clarity and momentum, creating significant drag.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose shows moments of beauty but suffers from repetitive structures ("Elowen smiled," "Elowen released," "Elowen packed," "Elowen's laughter" in sequence) and occasional purple patches like "luminous orb of autumn's promise." Several paraphrase loops appear, such as the redundant descriptions of renewal in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong syntactic variety and vivid imagery create momentum, but several instances of elevated diction and abstract phrasing dull immediacy ("geography of grief," "wilderness," "unseen horizons"). Some paraphrase loops appear in the middle section where the pattern arrangement is described multiple ways without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong opening establishes voice and atmosphere, but middle sections contain repetitive phrasing around "peripherally" and "harvest." Template cadence appears in the sequence "Elias began... Elias adjusted... Elias stored" though variety improves toward closure. Information density is generally high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition of key concepts without becoming loops. Information density is high—most sentences advance both atmosphere and plot. However, abstract phrases like "universal truths" and "map of human frailty" lack the concrete specificity that would elevate the writing, and some metaphors strain ("loom for universal truths").

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of lyric precision ("each bead a fleeting prism catching the dying light") but suffers from repetitive structures and some overwriting. Template cadence appears in memory crystals ("Here he was... But gone in an instant"). Information density varies—strong in sensory moments, weaker in abstract grief descriptions ("hollow in her chest"). Several filter-verb stacks in memory sequences reduce immediacy. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively with kettle/carving frame.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, but moderate overwriting in figurative density ("droplets hung mid-air like suspended regrets," "whispers that carried snippets"). Template cadence appears in fragment collection sequence ("One fragment...Another..."). Information density is good but some paraphrase loops around the erosion concept reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and good momentum. However, several overwrought metaphors strain clarity ("equations for hope," "cosmos of what could be") and some template constructions appear ("Elara knelt...Elara adjusted...Elara had not just"). Information density could be higher in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic variety and information density in places, but suffers from overwrought metaphors ("glacial hush descending like a slow-moving ice sheet"), repetitive abstract descriptors ("excruciatingly gentle" appears 3x), and the meta word-count commentary breaks immersion. Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.6)
    Several instances of overwriting weaken momentum: "serene upheaval" appears three times, creating a template pattern; abstract phrases like "architecture of lies" and "tapestry of half-truths" substitute for concrete imagery. The prose achieves clarity but suffers from repetitive conceptual language and occasional purple patches ("twilight's embrace cool his skin").

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions, but overwriting appears throughout: "tendrils of mist curling like spectral fingers," "shroud of quiet contemplation," "bioluminescent creatures rising in the night sea." Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle clarity (rope as both "labyrinth" and "sacred text"). Template cadence appears in the "here/there" construction and repetitive "Elias" sentence openings.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.6)
    Generally clean prose with evocative moments—"golden foliage drifted like forgotten memories onto moss-covered paths." Some figurative density threatens clarity ("cartographer of scars," "geography of healing") but doesn't fully obscure meaning. Minor template cadence appears in the "He [verb]" constructions mid-story. The writing achieves atmosphere but occasionally prioritizes poeticism over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the assembly sequence. However, abstract philosophizing creates density issues—"flawed genesis," "hollow echo of life," "sterile order" accumulate without concrete grounding. Several metaphors strain clarity ("stalactites that pierced the gloom like the teeth of some ancient beast").

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.7)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm in passages like the grafting sequence. However, several abstract phrases lack specificity ("defiant harmony," "unyielding compassion," "gracefully alert poise"), and there's some repetition of concepts (scars/singing appears multiple times). The opening sentence runs long at 35 words. Information density is moderate but could be higher given the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("dry lips of stone spouts whispered") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff. Template phrases like "luminous skeptic" and "realistically imaginative" feel forced. Several instances of elevated diction that doesn't quite fit ("sidereal patience" used repeatedly).

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The gear warmed against her, its mechanisms clicking faintly as if urging her onward, computing paths through the recursive haze." However, some figurative language approaches oversaturation ("nebula's swirling mists, thick with ionized particles") and occasional template cadence appears ("Elowen felt...Elowen pinged...Elowen extended").

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures support the meditative tone. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive "thundering calm" phrase (4 instances), some filter-verb clustering ("Elias felt," "he sought," "he needed"), and occasional purple prose in butterfly descriptions that don't fully pay off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm in the pendulum and tide descriptions. Multiple instances of abstract phrasing ("incremental absolution," "ethically diligent," "shared balance") that feel prompted rather than organic. Some overwriting in metaphorical passages ("tides that lapped against the tidal obsidian ridge," "fractured mirrors, whispering secrets") reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dense figurative language appears throughout without always serving pressure ("velveteen gloom" used three times, "tender organization" twice). The meta-commentary about word count creates a major artifact. Template cadence emerges in discovery sequence ("Each thread...revealed," "As he pieced...grew clearer"). Some effective moments exist (the silo description, moonlight staging) but overwriting and repetition accumulate throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dense, concept-heavy prose creates momentum issues with phrases like "to seed innovation within the constraint of a world grown stagnant" and repetitive constructions ("would warmth return, or would floods drown"). Multiple template cadences appear ("Elara had journeyed," "Elara selected," "Elara recalled") and the elevated register often obscures rather than clarifies the action.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, repetitive constructions appear ("Elias + verb" patterns, "thistled calm" used three times) and some abstract phrases like "narrative drought" and "story famine" become conceptual crutches rather than embodied images.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("edges like forgotten regrets"), but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: the safety/illusion concept restates across multiple sentences without added pressure. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions. Filter-verb stacks in the middle third ("she prepared," "she drew," "she arranged") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("the waterlogged tunnels hummed with the indifferent drip of eternity") but suffers from density issues - nearly every sentence carries figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Some overwriting: "viral shadow lifting like fog from a fetid marsh." The excavation sequence maintains good momentum despite occasional purple patches.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong opening/closing lines. However, several instances of overwriting appear in peak moments ("the unlearning of hatred," "traveled stillness of evenings") without pattern-teaching payoff, triggering -0.5. Some metaphors strain credibility ("shadows lengthened across the velvet tomes"). Template cadence appears in the teaching sequence with repetitive "the poet... the worker... the violinist" structures.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant overwriting mars peak beats: "ethereal shadows on the rusted beams," "symphony of past and possibility," "verdant futures." Template cadence appears in "He knelt...He cleared...He pressed." The paraphrase loop of "gentle rebellion" concepts repeats across multiple paragraphs. Information density suffers from abstract philosophizing that doesn't advance plot.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("fireflies began their mimicry of lost power") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear pattern-teaching. Several abstract phrases ("gateway of mystery," "portal to enchantment") and repetitive constructions around wonder-preservation create mild momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong control but suffers from overwriting—phrases like "sanctifying the space through displaced objects" and "hushed reverence that blazed like embers under ash" strain for effect. Information density is high but some metaphors feel forced ("streetlights daydreamed"). The writing would benefit from pruning ornamental language while preserving its lyrical core. Template cadence appears in the restoration sequence ("He started with...The toy...Chairs he drew").

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong imagery but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language ("certainty like a shroud," "cascading truths," "unspooling like vines"). Template patterns appear ("The first revelation," "The next truth," "The third revelation"). Final paragraph's meta-commentary about word count breaks immersion entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of precision ("stairs spiraling without origin or end, defying entropy") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Balancedly daring, he dared") and abstract density that occasionally obscures concrete action. Several passages loop conceptually without advancing pressure, particularly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong rhythmic control and varied syntax support the dreamlike atmosphere. Information density high in descriptive passages. However, multiple instances of abstraction ("methodically hopeful," "profound, saffron quiet peace") and some template phrasing in the daydream sequences ("In his mind's eye," "In the vision") create scaffold. The modifier-heavy prose occasionally obscures rather than clarifies ("moon-tipped bristles danced under the waxing glow").

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose achieves atmospheric density and avoids major loops, it suffers from overwriting in places—"the monumental waterfall's roar muffled the world's chaos" could be simpler. Multiple complex noun phrases slow momentum ("the tactile knowledge of shaping dough into initials—a dying art she was desperate to rescue"). The writing is competent but occasionally chooses ornament over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose shows moments of strong rhythm but suffers from repetitive abstract phrases ("latent radiance" 6x, "bleak exhilaration" 4x, "neatly inventive" 3x) that become template-like. Dense figurative language in nearly every sentence creates overwriting without payoff. Line "threads of destiny snapping, hunger's curse lifting" tells what should be shown through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose shows moments of atmospheric control ("velvet over thorns," "shattered glass that glittered with an unnatural, lingering luminance") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around the luminance concept. The catastrophic meta-commentary ("Word count error—must fit," "Actually," "Adjust") creates unprecedented artifact density in the final third, obliterating narrative momentum. Template phrases like "twisted her mind" and "faltered, revealing fear's core frailty" further erode line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of vivid imagery ("sea's vast mirror fractured into sapphire shards") but accumulates figurative density that occasionally obscures clarity. Template repetition appears in "Leeward's [trait]" constructions and some synonym loops ("restless euphony"/"restless pulse"). The climactic sequence maintains momentum despite heavy metaphor layering, with strong verb choices ("dubbing," "sketching," "generating") driving action.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose density is high with purposeful figurative language ("sunwashed dread," "silence a cipher waiting to crack") but suffers from occasional template cadence in middle sections ("Elara believed... She raised... She persisted"). Some filter verb clustering ("Elara wondered," "she vowed," "she pored") dulls immediacy in transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose achieves strong moments of sensory specificity ("iron rails choked by ivy that climbed the faded signposts like possessive fingers") but occasionally loops conceptually, particularly around the noble lies theme. Information density is generally high though some reflection passages could be compressed. Minor template cadence in middle section ("Elias knew...Elias traced...Elias felt") detracts from otherwise varied rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    Several strong images ("boots sinking into damp sand," "bioluminescent algae") demonstrate capable prose. However, abstract phrases like "interlaced absences" appear repeatedly without earning their weight through concrete dramatization. The meta-commentary about word count and revision ("642—no, recalibrate") severely disrupts momentum. Template phrasing emerges in emotional beats ("stoically sensitive," "quiet fire of his inner world").

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    Generally clear prose with good information density, but several repetitive elements reduce momentum. "Tranquilly perceptive" and "dappled resolve" appear multiple times, creating template-like echoes. Some parallel sentence structures create rhythmic monotony. Clarity remains intact but efficiency could improve.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though figurative language occasionally overwhelms ("shadows of leaves twisted like anguished spirits"). Some template cadence appears in the ritual sequences, but rhythm generally varies naturally and supports the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dense figurative language appears in most high-pressure beats without clear payoff ("cold star," "digital spear," "bloom of fire and shrapnel"), creating opacity rather than precision. Template phrases like "bleak exhilaration" repeat five times, and abstract constructions ("intangibly tangible") muddle clarity at crucial moments including closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Elara [verb]" opens multiple paragraphs) and occasional overwriting ("stardust robes," "luminous paths etched by ancient astronomers"). Information density varies—some passages layer action and atmosphere effectively while others loop through near-synonymous descriptions of cosmic connection.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with effective imagery and rhythm. Good metaphorical work in opening lines. Some repetitive phrasing around "sieved hush" and minor template cadence in sentence structures. A few instances of slight overwriting that don't quite reach artifact level but create small momentum drags.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from consistent overwriting: "storm-worn parapet," "furrowed hush," "untethered alliances prematurely." Template constructions appear throughout ("Elias nodded," "Lira lingered," "Elias smiled faintly"). The paraphrase loop in lines about recycling mistakes (paragraphs 5, 8, 10) dulls momentum. Strong opening image but repetitive "mist" references (7 instances) create monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.2)
    Strong moments like "the launch's wooden ramp creaking like a reluctant confession" show capable prose, but the text is riddled with fatal artifacts. Meta-commentary brackets, word count notes, and visible revision marks ("710—wait, trim for exact") demonstrate complete failure of line-level control. Template phrasing appears in emotional beats, and the final paragraph's compressed summary replaces scene work with scaffolding that destroys readability.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("delicately robust" appears twice verbatim), abstract emotional labeling ("jaded wonder"), and the jarring meta-scaffolding in the final paragraph that reads like visible revision notes. Strong moments exist (the lake description, the newspaper code revelation), but overwriting in places ("inverted sky," "ethereal blue-green") and the self-conscious ending significantly harm line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe overwriting throughout with mixed metaphors ("bones softened like moonlight on water"), repetitive phrasing ("paradoxically steady" appears multiple times), and editorial scaffolding visible in the final lines. Template cadence runs ("She [verb]," "Elara [verb]") and synonym churn ("cosmic intimacy"/"intimate vigil") further muddle clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments of density ("each breath a tangle of ethereal vapors that clung to her lungs like forbidden secrets") but suffers from overwriting. Multiple instances of stacked modifiers blur sense ("ethereal hourglasses half-buried in mist, their sands frozen in perpetual dusk"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("willingly perplexed" concept restated), and figurative density in high-pressure beats lacks payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.5)
    Several runs of template cadence ("Elias activated...Elias initiated...Elias began") and abstract phrasing ("pure intent," "serene expanse") that dulls specificity. Strong moments like "shimmers danced under his light" and "gravitationally lighter when happy" show capability, but overwriting in phrases like "resolve ghostly yet unyielding" creates distance. Filter-verb stack in ritual sequence reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the prose achieves moments of beauty ("constellation on earth that mirrored the heavens"), it suffers from overwriting in key beats—"vibrant hush" appears four times, creating a paraphrase loop. Dense figurative language in nearly every sentence of high-pressure moments ("gritty silk," "hollow vessel," "seeds of light") dulls impact without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive constructions ("Elara's vigilance... Elara's inventive mind... Elara sealed") and some overwritten passages ("luminous fort at twilight, where walls shimmered like captured starlight"). Information density is adequate but several sentences restate rather than advance, particularly in the middle sections describing the sundial mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose density works effectively in places ("silvery helix," "frictionless fall") but suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around "sacred patterns" and some template constructions ("Elara's breath caught as..."). Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the curse's effects being restated rather than deepened.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Deductions for repetitive use of "storm-kissed wonder" (appears twice), "furiously tranquil" (twice), and "cartography of scars" (twice) creating mild template feel. Some elevated diction borders on purple ("tempests that mirrored his inner turmoil").

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant repetition issues: "diplomatically fierce" appears four times, "dignified chaos" twice, "while waiting" three times, creating template cadence. Overwritten metaphors accumulate ("symphony of whispers," "veins of doubt," "lion debating with scholars"). Some sentences sprawl without advancing pressure. The prose reaches for literary effect but often achieves purple rather than precise.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("pages yellowed, spines cracked like old bones") but suffers from repetitive "blooming" variants (appears 4 times) and abstract constructions like "ferrying ideas that fractured the monotony." The participial opener "Sorting the books by the moonlight's luminous fracture" creates unnecessary simultaneity confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.8)
    Information density suffers from abstract phrasing ("audacious performance," "defiant song") and some paraphrase loops around the longing/memory complex. The prose achieves moments of clarity ("fingers still aching from the keys") but relies heavily on elevated diction that occasionally obscures concrete action, particularly in the climactic performance sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves lyrical density without sacrificing clarity, though some abstract phrases ("luminous doubt," "empirically whimsical") repeat without variation. Strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Minor template patterns in "She [verb]" constructions. Information density is high with most sentences serving multiple functions.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong moments like "the breezy islet hummed with the aftermath of rain" show skilled prose, but repetitive structures appear ("Elias rose," "Elias spoke," "Elias lifted") and some passages loop concepts ("unspoken apologies" appears multiple times). Metaphorical density occasionally obscures clarity ("tides of remembrance," "cerulean regret," "wounds reopening"). Filter constructions and abstract phrasing ("felt the unspoken apologies take form") reduce immediacy in key beats.

    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, with no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. The opening and closing lines are particularly strong.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences doing multiple jobs of advancing story and atmosphere. There is a minor instance of potential synonym churn ("unshaken marvel" appears three times), but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image. The final line is a masterful, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "skeletal fingers," serves character and atmosphere without muddle. Line-level craft supports clarity and momentum through to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished and evocative, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductive for a template cadence in the opening ("measured in whispers and rationed breaths") and a slight over-density of metaphor in some beats, which, while beautiful, momentarily slows momentum without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic but occasionally overwritten with figurative language in peak beats, though clarity persists. Minor synonym churn (e.g., "foggy lucidity" repeated) slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose has high density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting occurs (e.g., repeated "quaking reverie"). However, no loops or scaffolds obscure closure, and figurative language supports the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor flaw is the repetitive use of the phrase "staggering grace," which creates a slight template cadence. However, this does not obscure causality or closure, and the sentence-level propulsion remains clear and effective throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and information density. A minor template-cadence issue appears with repetitive "wait—" constructions in the final paragraph, creating a slight scaffold that disrupts the closure's momentum. This prevents a higher score despite otherwise exemplary line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is densely poetic and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. There is a minor risk of overwriting in the relentless figurative language ("lantern's heart," "swirling vapors"), but it remains coherent and serves the accumulative, textural drive. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure causality or the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally lush, controlled, and purposeful, with strong rhythmic variation. A minor artifact penalty (-0.4) is applied for a template cadence in the phrase "drip-drip of melting ice" and "the thawing heart, that gradual dissolution..." which creates a slight repetitive stem. The closure beat remains clear and unaffected.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong, vivid, and propulsive. However, it is occasionally slightly overwritten with stacked modifiers and figurative language ("stars above mocking her with their unyielding light," "chasm of betrayal yawning"). These moments, while often effective, create minor density spikes that slightly slow momentum in an otherwise tightly paced narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, poetic, and highly effective, with strong rhythmic control. Minor deductions for slight overwriting in phrases like "ambered hush—the preserved silences of ancient prophecies, trapped like insects in golden resin," which, while beautiful, slightly slows momentum. No loops, scaffolds, or clarity issues; the closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic but occasionally overwrought (e.g., "fractured across icicles like forgotten memories" strains coherence), though artifacts do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is vivid with strong rhythm, but minor overwriting occurs, like "ambiguously clear" repetition, without harming closure. Information density is high, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No major artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and sensory density. However, minor overwriting is present (e.g., "forgotten promises," "fabricated realities had shattered lives like fragile glass"), applying figurative language in clusters that slightly slow momentum. These artifacts do not touch the closure beat but prevent a higher score. Sentence-level propulsion is otherwise strong and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic but suffers from overwriting (e.g., "tapestry of sideways eternity") and minor artifact loops, though clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, minor overwriting occurs in peak beats (e.g., "liminal realms where the living world blurred into the echoes of the departed"), applying figurative pressure that slightly blurs sense. A few synonym loops ("inspired no longer by mystery but by resolution") create minor scaffold, but momentum and clarity are largely maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in phrases like "ethereal dance a reminder of beauties" slightly reduces concision, but no loops or scaffolds harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but minor overwriting occurs (e.g., "drowsy alertness" repeated). Figurative language is generally coherent, and propulsion is strong without loops obscuring closure. A slight register drift in peak beats prevents a higher score, but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("regenerative silence that healed without words") that slightly dulls immediacy, and a subtle template cadence in lists of decay ("ivy claiming pages... air hung heavy..."). The closure beat, however, remains crystal clear.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight repetition of "cautious exuberance" and a template cadence in "Her steps were soft...". These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, but occasional stacked metaphors ("bronze quiet of forgotten epochs") risk purple prose; no major artifacts harm momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful, and syntax varies naturally to support momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly dense and rhythmic, with strong information density. Minor artifacts include some repetitive stems ("unraveled stillness") and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in peak beats ("like blue-tinged fog"), which creates a minor drag on momentum without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, a tendency toward dense figurative language ("a quiet inversion where the sky seemed to cradle the earth") creates minor momentum drag in early beats. The clarity and propulsion recover fully for the powerful closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose has high density and rhythmic control, but slight overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "forgotten stars") doesn't obscure closure. Sentences advance story without loops; propulsion is clear in beats like the shadow confrontation. Information is concise with varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language (e.g., "petrified bloom") that avoids muddle. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; sentences advance story and atmosphere cleanly. Peak beats maintain clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is concise and rhythmically varied, with high information density and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is controlled, and sentences advance story and atmosphere. Peak beats maintain clarity without muddle, supporting propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is richly textured and purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "danced like forgotten regrets") and one potential paraphrase loop ("wistful disposition" / "wistful fractures"), but these do not materially obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, but figurative language sometimes overwhelms clarity in peak beats (e.g., "texture felt in the heart's quiet roar"). Minor paraphrase loops and abstraction prevent higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("sounds lingered like half-forgotten whispers") is consistent, purposeful, and never muddles clarity. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, with rhythm and syntax perfectly matching the contemplative yet charged atmosphere. The final line is a powerful, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "static kiss." Sentences are clear and concise, with strong verbs and specific nouns. No artifacts obscure closure; read-aloud flow is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, but minor overwriting (e.g., repetitive "cautious exuberance") and figurative density slightly dull momentum. No major artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, a tendency toward dense figurative language ("luminescent ache," "graft herself") creates minor momentum drag in a few high-pressure beats. The final paragraph's cadence is effective, but some earlier sentences could be more concise. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor deductions for occasional dense metaphor clusters ("swirls of half-formed illustrations") in high-pressure beats that momentarily slow momentum, though clarity is never fully obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language ("stalactites wept crystalline tears") is consistent and voice-motivated. No loops or scaffold issues; sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the scene's emotional cadence. Minor overwriting risk in peak beats, but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmically varied, with high information density, though occasional figurative stacks (e.g., "sense memories weaving like cool sapphire threads") border on overwriting without harming clarity. Momentum is maintained, and no loops or scaffolds obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, minor artifacts prevent a higher score: "verdant shroud" is a slightly cliché metaphor, and the triple repetition of "behaviors" in one sentence creates a faint template cadence. These are hairline slips that do not touch the closure but indicate a lack of absolute mastery at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, but some phrases verge on decorative ("fractured skies and parched horizons"). A minor paraphrase loop occurs with "haggard awe" used three times. The closure beat, however, remains clear and unaffected by these artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and no significant artifacts; figurative language is coherent, though "bright darkness" risks mild contradiction but serves tone.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush and highly descriptive, which generally serves the accumulative mode. However, this density occasionally flirts with overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "painting absences where histories had frayed"), creating minor momentum drag. The sentence-level rhythm is purposeful and varied, supporting the story's contemplative pace. No critical artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but occasionally overwritten, with minor repetition like "analytically artistic." However, rhythm varies purposefully, and clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor text artifact exists: a template cadence run ("Elara nodded..."; "Lir gasped...") in adjacent paragraphs during the climax, and a slight synonym churn between "unheard symphony" and "full orchestra." These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in "What if... What if..." and slight synonym churn ("quiet storm," "hushed thunder"). These do not obscure closure, but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the peak beat describing the ink's effect ("shadows danced on the walls as if the chemicals in the air conspired"), which momentarily risks clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "textures of devotion rough as the trees' scarred skin" slightly mixes metaphors (texture/touch vs. visual scar). This is a hairline slip that does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, but occasional overwriting like "echoing with the lap of waves" risks mild figurative stacking. No major loops or artifacts harm clarity; information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely exceptional with high information density and vivid imagery. A minor deduction for a slight figurative overload in the peak emotional beat ("Gloomy cheer washed over him—the joy of hearing her again, bittersweet in its impermanence, like laughter in a storm") which slightly slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and vivid with strong propulsion, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, though slightly purple in peaks without muddling clarity. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and closure image is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythm and variation, but suffers from minor overwriting (e.g., "shadows pooling like forgotten dreams") that adds decorative texture without advancing pressure. No major loops or artifacts, but figurative language in peak beats slightly muddles clarity. Information density is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. A single minor artifact ("heartfelt artisan" and "heartfelt ache" slightly chime) prevents a perfect score but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor artifact exists: a slight over-reliance on compound-complex sentences in the opening paragraph ("hunched over his scarred desk... the air thick... as if the frozen lake...") creates a measured cadence that, while beautiful, slightly impedes the initial momentum. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure, which is rendered with crystalline clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally trends toward overwriting and synonym churn (e.g., "wild hush" appears multiple times, "whispers of wind tangled with forgotten echoes"). This decorative density, while often effective, creates minor momentum drag in places, preventing a higher score despite the overall beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and clear propulsion. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the opening paragraph ("coral-veiled columns," "lonesome splendor," "ethereal glow") which, while beautiful, borders on decorative in a high-pressure beat. However, it quickly tightens and remains clear throughout the critical closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language, like "thread the labyrinth," is purposeful and clear. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and sensory density, though it occasionally leans into decorative phrasing ("pools of mournful elation"). A minor template cadence is detected in the description of the ghost's appearances, and a slight paraphrase loop exists between "mournful elation" and "elated in sorrow," preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent, though minor overwriting ("shadow infused with orchid solace") slightly slows momentum in peaks. No paraphrase loops or scaffold artifacts; sentence-level propulsion is strong. Rhythm supports the lyrical tone without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, though minor figurative stacking in peaks slightly reduces clarity without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and a controlled, purposeful rhythm. However, a minor pattern of slightly overwrought phrasing emerges ("quiet ache," "dying stars," "tactile soul"), creating a subtle textural consistency that, while often beautiful, occasionally borders on stylistic excess. This does not obscure closure but slightly diminishes line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic, though slightly overwritten in places (e.g., "leaves of sapphire hue drifted like forgotten constellations"). A minor figurative muddle prevents a higher score, but momentum is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose has high density and varied rhythm, but figurative language stacks in high-pressure beats (e.g., "fierce tenderness" repeated) create mild overwriting without pattern payoff. No major artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, this density occasionally borders on overwriting in high-pressure beats, with a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives ("lotus-hearted," "shrewdly innocent") that can feel slightly manufactured. The sentence "She knew these notes held not just words, but the raw fears of separation..." is an example of exposition that tells what the imagery should show. No major artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and poetic with varied rhythm, but some overwriting (e.g., "bitter coffee that tasted of forgotten dreams") introduces minor figurative muddle. Information density is high, and propulsion remains clear, with no significant loops or artifacts harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly inventive with excellent rhythm. Minor artifacting: some near-synonym phrasing ("suspended moment," "pause elongated") and a slightly over-stacked metaphor ("fractal patterns" of sound). However, these do not obscure causality or closure, and the information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic variation. No significant loops or figurative muddle harm closure, though slight overwriting exists in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and purposeful, with varied rhythm, but figurative density in peaks like "spectral flowers" risks slight muddle. Minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "centuries of longing" repeated) reduce momentum without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language coherent and pattern-taught. No loops or scaffolds obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and purposeful, with high information density. Rhythm is controlled and varies with the scene's needs. Minor artifacts: a slight synonym loop ("cautious exuberance"/"careful recklessness") and a mildly stacked modifier ("low vibration that resonated"). These do not obscure causality or dull the closure image but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and minimal artifacts. Some metaphorical phrasing like "dappled resolve" is consistent but slightly overwritten in spots.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in peak beats (e.g., "like a healer's promise") and a few near-synonym phrases ("forging paper trails," "craft a new self"). These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly descriptive, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, a tendency toward slightly over-written or redundant phrasing appears ("fractured hush of a world reshaped," "drifting prism terrace... suspended in the void") which, while often beautiful, occasionally creates minor momentum drag without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language serves the tone without muddle; sentences advance story efficiently, even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor deduction for occasional moments of overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "cheerful gloom deepened into a soft laugh, tinged with melancholy"), where figurative language stacks slightly and risks blurring sense. The closure, however, remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language enhances clarity, and sentences propel the story. Read-aloud test passes smoothly, with peak beats remaining clear.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. Rhythm is controlled and varies naturally with the ritual's pace. A minor instance of potential overwriting ("Pain bloomed like a dark rose") slightly dulls the immediacy of a peak beat, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction is applied for a slight risk of overwriting in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "noctilucent reckonings—those ethereal glows of insight"), where the figurative language momentarily borders on abstraction, though it remains legible and does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting occurs (e.g., "hard softness" repeated near the end). No major artifacts obscure closure; sentences advance story efficiently. Figurative language is generally coherent, though slightly stacked in peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful, with varied rhythm and clear propulsion. Minor overwriting risks (e.g., stacked metaphors in peaks) but no artifacts harming closure. Information density is high, and sentences advance story efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished with vivid imagery, though occasional figurative density slightly slows momentum; however, it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, but this creates minor momentum drag in high-pressure beats with stacked metaphors (e.g., "prism parapet gleamed like shattered rainbows"). While purposeful, the figurative language occasionally borders on overwriting, though it never obscures causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a few artifacts prevent a higher score: the repetitive use of "flawed" and the slightly templated cadence of "She was the forever war peace negotiator." These are minor and do not touch the closure, but they are noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and vivid, precise imagery ("bruised with gathering clouds," "swirl like ghosts"). A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the peak beat: "the fractured grace of the landscape evoking a ballet frozen mid-step" is a beautiful but slightly abstract image that momentarily pauses the tactile immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush and highly deliberate, with strong rhythmic control. However, a pattern of figurative language ("bodily poetic grace," "limbs flowing like stanzas") creates minor density artifacts in high-pressure beats, slightly obscuring the immediacy of the climactic unlock.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. However, minor overwriting occurs with near-synonym loops ("hush...silence...quiet") and a slightly over-stacked metaphor ("pulse with half-lit epiphanies—fleeting insights..."). These are minor artifacts that do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation and sensory density. However, minor artifacts prevent a 9+ score: a tendency toward ornate phrasing ("fragile exodus marking the twilight of their ancient lineage") and a slight over-reliance on visual description at the expense of other senses in peak beats create occasional, minor drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, though slight overwriting occurs in peak beats (e.g., stacked metaphors). No major loops or scaffolds; propulsion is clear, and closure is unharmed. Figurative language is generally purposeful and pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and vivid, precise imagery ("iridescent veins," "gritty veil"). A minor deduction for a pattern of slightly overcooked figurative language in a few spots (e.g., "dancing in exact patterns as if mocking her quest"), which creates a fleeting moment of stylistic self-awareness that slightly detracts from momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but purposeful, with good rhythm and propulsion. Minor overwriting (e.g., "dusky harmony" repetition) slightly dulls clarity but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor instance of overwriting occurs in the line "shifting grace—fluid, elusive, reappearing when needed most to mend what hatred had torn," which slightly disrupts the narrative momentum with abstract summation. Otherwise, the language is dense and propulsive, doing multiple jobs of advancing character, theme, and atmosphere simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion that accelerates with the protagonist's breathing. A minor instance of potential overwriting occurs in "crystalline, resonant, where every breath echoed against invisible cliffs," where the figurative language stacks slightly. However, this is a hairline slip that does not obscure clarity or harm the closure, and the sentence-level craft otherwise remains flawless and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied syntax; minor overwriting risks (e.g., "deciduous vows" slightly strains metaphor) do not obscure closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts harm momentum; read-aloud rhythm supports accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten (e.g., "brightened disquiet" risks mixed metaphor), with minor synonym churn. However, rhythm and clarity propel the story without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and figurative but maintains momentum with varied rhythm; minor overwriting occurs in peaks (e.g., "harmonies that echoed only in the mind"), yet no significant artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwrought, e.g., "unkindled solace" risks mixed metaphor. Rhythm is generally strong, with good propulsion. Minor artifacts like synonym churn, but no major loops obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor figurative muddle appears in the peak beat ("like archiving a storm into shelves of calm"), which is a slightly strained metaphor that briefly obscures sense. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with concision and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor issues include slight density in figurative language ("petals of silence") and a few redundant phrases ("hammered repose" appears twice). However, these do not obscure causality or closure, and the line-level craft is otherwise exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on compound sentences in high-pressure beats and a few near-synonyms ("thistle-blown hope," "thistle-light but unyielding"). No loops or scaffold that harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is lush and highly polished, with excellent rhythm and information density. Most sentences advance multiple jobs of character, atmosphere, and plot. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "preemptively nostalgic" is repeated three times, creating a slight synonym loop that, while thematically relevant, creates a small echo. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure beat. Figurative language is consistent and coherent, supporting the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: some near-synonym loops ("whispering against the dew-kissed earth") and a slightly over-written phrase ("volatile essence that could birth or consume"). However, these do not obscure causality or dull the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and sensory density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "like kelp strands in a current" following other metaphors), but it does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "silences held tastes like rare spices" is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative texture, with clear closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and a varied, purposeful rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity rather than obscuring it. A minor instance of potential register drift ("fluidly logical") and a subtle paraphrase between "vast emptiness" and "void of loneliness" prevent a perfect score, but momentum and clarity are superb.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and vivid with strong rhythm, but slight overwriting occurs (e.g., "holographic ghosts of ancient forests" risks purple prose). No major artifacts or loops; clarity and propulsion remain high, especially in climax.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is exceptionally vivid and dense, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "unfurling it like releasing a long-held breath") and a near-paraphrase loop between "magnify small kindnesses" and "magnifying these obscured generosities." These do not harm closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally dense and purposeful, but suffers from minor figurative overload in high-pressure beats (e.g., "unraveling plans... like dying embers"). This creates a slight drag on momentum and clarity, though it does not fundamentally obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but purposeful, with varied rhythm and high information density. Minor artifacts include synonym churn (e.g., "vested hush" repetitions) and some mixed metaphors, but they don't harm closure. Read-aloud flow is generally smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly crafted with excellent rhythm and density. However, the repetition of "mossy delight" (3x) and "prod/prodding" (3x) creates a minor template cadence, preventing a higher score. Figurative language is otherwise well-controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is concise and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density, as in "mist rising like ghosts." No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language enhances clarity. Peak beats maintain coherence without muddle, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor prose artifact exists: the repetition of "echoed silence" creates a slight, unintentional loop that dulls the phrase's impact. The description is otherwise vivid and purposeful, and the closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely clear and propulsive, with high information density. A minor deduction for a few instances of potentially mixed metaphor ("heart a drum of abandon tempered by care") and a tendency toward ornate diction in high-pressure beats that slightly slows momentum without fully obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts are present: a tendency towards stacked, slightly redundant metaphors (e.g., "forged hush, a silence hammered") and a paraphrase loop near the end discussing "truth" and "refraction." These slightly dull the closure's clarity but do not break it.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly purposeful, with excellent rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight over-density of figurative language in some high-pressure beats (e.g., "like incense laced with foreboding"), but it remains coherent and largely serves the tone. No loops, scaffolds, or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is exceptionally lush and controlled, with high information density and varied rhythm. However, a -0.4 deduction is applied for a template-cadence run of figurative language in the high-pressure climax ("Fragments resurfaced: Kai's laughter... their first tentative kiss... promises etched..."), which slightly dulls the immediacy of the beat despite its beauty. The closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythm and sensory detail. Minor deductions for occasional moments of slightly overwrought description (e.g., "rusted monoliths," "unnaturally low" auroras) that momentarily stall momentum, but these do not obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is largely crisp and purposeful, with strong information density. However, minor artifacts slightly dull momentum: a cliché ("voice sharp as a fresh broadsheet"), a slightly mixed metaphor ("tangled legacy"), and a moment of near-paraphrase ("echoing legacy" followed by "orbits like distant moons"). These are minor blemishes in an otherwise well-controlled line-level execution that propels the story to its closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density—e.g., "warm coldness" encapsulates tone and theme. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the renaming beat. Minor artifact: slight over-density in peak beats ("aberrant mercy bloomed... warm against the cold steel") risks abstraction but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, with varied sentence openings.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and highly sensory, effectively mirroring Eliza's perception. However, this density occasionally flirts with overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "echoes blooming into tapestries of color"). A template cadence emerges in a few adjacent sentences describing the ghost's form and voice. The closure image remains clear and potent despite these minor artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong information density. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the final paragraph ("glowed eternal," "forged something profound") which feels slightly elevated compared to the grounded, embodied language preceding it. However, clarity and momentum are never obscured, and there are no loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic variation, though minor overwriting occurs (e.g., "factually mystical" borders on label-speak). No significant loops or artifacts obscure causality; propulsion remains clear through to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally flirts with overwriting; phrases like "the accumulated snow, not yet melted by the hesitant sun" and "mutting the world's clamor to a hushed symphony" are slightly redundant. This creates minor momentum drag in the opening paragraphs. The clarity and propulsion recover strongly for the climax and closure, with clean, advancing sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, a pattern of elegant, complex sentences creates a consistent, somewhat uniform cadence that, while often effective, occasionally borders on overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "The palimpsest promise reformed in his heart—simple, renewed"). This minor artifact prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly purposeful, with excellent rhythmic control. However, a minor artifact penalty (-0.3) is applied for a pattern of stacked modifiers and near-synonym phrases (e.g., "scorched wasteland," "quiet resolve," "forgotten secrets") in the opening graph, creating a slight initial overlayering before the narrative finds its precise, propulsive footing.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, though figurative language occasionally stacks in peak beats ("shadows that danced like living memories"). Minor template cadence appears in three consecutive "their" phrases during the spectral manifestation. No artifacts harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor deduction is applied for a slight risk of ornamental density in phrases like "inevitably whimsical energy" and "prismatic refractions," which, while beautiful, momentarily approach a decorative stack. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure beat. The sentence-level propulsion and information density are otherwise exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied syntax and strong rhythm. Minor overwriting in phrases like "ethereal pull of the cosmos" slightly dampens momentum but doesn't harm clarity. No loops or artifacts affecting closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery ("forgotten veins," "wistful echo of freedom").

    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, clear propulsion, and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied syntax that supports propulsion. Minor overwriting in metaphors does not harm clarity or closure. No significant loops or artifacts; craft is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose has high density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in metaphoric stacks (e.g., "forgotten heartbeats") slightly dulls peak beats. No significant loops or artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for occasional dense phrasing ("enlarged tranquility") and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats, but it never obscures causality or closure. Momentum is well-maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density ("frost nipping the air and leaves carpeting the ground in crimson decay"). Minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "whispering encouragements to the earth as if it were a skittish child," but clarity and momentum are maintained. No significant artifacts or loops detract from closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished, vivid, and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a tendency toward dense figurative language ("crystallizing into fleeting diamonds," "fragile as the illusions") creates minor decorative overload in the opening, slightly slowing momentum. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the clarity of the closure beat, where the language becomes more direct and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with good syntactic variety and information density. Minor issues include slight repetition of "comforting unease" and template-like phrasing in false start descriptions, but no major artifacts harm propulsion or closure. Figurative language is generally purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly dense, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward stacked metaphors (e.g., "veins held comet trails") and a single template cadence ("Elara wondered... Elara needed..."). These do not obscure closure but slightly dilute line-level precision in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and sensory density. A slight artifact exists: the phrase "auroral sorrow" is repeated three times, creating a minor pattern that, while thematic, slightly dulls the final image's impact. Otherwise, propulsion and clarity are superb.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "nostalgia gripped him like rust, pulling him," "static resisted, coiling like thorns"), though the pattern is consistent and voice-motivated. No loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and poetic but maintains momentum, with sentences advancing story, character, or atmosphere ("Curiosity, that old companion, drew her out"). There is minor figurative stacking in high-pressure beats (e.g., "stories multiplied as dawn deepened"), but it remains legible and voice-motivated. No significant loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure causality or closure. The final image is clear and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and dense, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally trends toward density, with figurative language appearing in most sentences ("shadow given form," "symphony of encrypted verses"). This creates a minor artifact of slight overwriting in high-pressure beats, though it never obscures causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("like a shadow fleeing light") and a template cadence in "His fingers traced the residues—dark whorls suggesting...". However, clarity and momentum are never lost, and the closure image is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density, but minor overwriting (e.g., "terrestrially cosmic") causes slight figurative muddle. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and no loops obscure closure. Craft supports momentum without major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Every sentence advances character or atmosphere.

The final line is a masterclass in concision and resonance, perfectly capping the accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density. However, minor instances of ornate phrasing ("veils of forgotten light") and a tendency toward abstract embodiment ("luminous sorrow") create slight momentum drag and prevent a flawless score. The closure beat remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly dense, with sentences doing multiple jobs of advancing character, atmosphere, and theme. Rhythm is varied and purposeful. A minor deduction for a subtle template cadence in the recurrence of "pearl twilight" and "wisely enduring," and for a single mixed metaphor ("scalpel's incision" alongside "wild rebellion").

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is richly textured and purposeful, with high information density. However, it occasionally flirts with overwriting; phrases like "reed-blown melancholy" and "serpentine nexus" are evocative but risk decorative stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor artifacts include a slight template cadence in early description ("The ancient stone wall... murmured secrets... Hiroshi... moved with the quiet grace...") and one mixed metaphor ("like tears sparkling on a mourner's cheek"), but clarity and momentum remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally concise and propulsive, with high information density. A minor scaffold phrase ("But wait, that's over—adjusting...") creates a slight momentum drag and reveals a processing artifact. Otherwise, sentences are clean and advance character and plot effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, some figurative language strains coherence (e.g., "storm's pulse sync with his heart") and creates minor artifacts. The density of poetic description in high-pressure beats occasionally slows momentum, though it never obscures causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly textured with excellent rhythmic control. Minor deduct for slight repetition of "lonesome splendor" and "positively wistful," which feels slightly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control that supports the atmospheric pressure. There is a minor instance of slightly overwrought phrasing ("static longing") that briefly calls attention to itself, but it does not obscure causality or dull the powerful closure image. The language is otherwise flawless and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, but slight overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "luminous ache" repetition) introduces minor artifacts, though closure is unharmed.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful sensory detail. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "pulsing stillness" appears three times), creating a mild pattern that slightly dulls the immediacy of the closure scene without breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor artifact is present: the phrase "quietly deliberate" is used three times, creating a slight template cadence. The description of the key's "mechanical heartbeat" is a standout, perfectly blending sensory detail with concept.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and elegant, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. No major artifacts harm closure; minor overwriting is purposeful and doesn't obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten with minor figurative density (e.g., "zephyr bloom" repetition); rhythm varies, though some loops slightly dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and information density. However, slight figurative density appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "vulnerability wrapped around her like a protective shroud"), and a minor paraphrase loop occurs near the end ("quiet resolve" / "honeyed hush"). These are minor artifacts that do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density, but slight overwriting in peak beats (e.g., stacked metaphors in "swirling hush enveloped him like a lover's breath") risks muddle, though clarity remains at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with minimal artifacts. Some figurative language leans purple but remains coherent; propulsion is clear, and closure is undulled by line-level issues.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)

    Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied sentence openings and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("crystallized time," "fleeting prism") is pattern-taught and pays off. Minor artifact: "rust-hued peace" slightly elevates diction but is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, enhancing rather than obscuring clarity. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; every sentence advances atmosphere and character. A minor register elevation in "spectral remnants" is voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. However, minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a template cadence emerges in descriptions of wonder ("stoic wonder," "familiar cloak," "quiet mysteries"), and the phrase "equations for hope" is a near-abstraction. These are minor but noticeable in an otherwise polished text.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense with figurative language but maintains rhythm and clarity. Minor artifacts include repeated phrases like "excruciatingly gentle" and synonym churn, though they do not harm closure. Information density is high, advancing story and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor overwriting is present (e.g., "prismatic whispers," "labyrinth of secrets"), creating a slight density that, while often beautiful, occasionally borders on ornamental rather than propulsive. The closure, however, remains clear and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is vividly descriptive and highly polished, with strong rhythmic control and information density. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward abstract language in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "geography of healing," "lonesome splendor"). However, no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddles obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, some figurative language verges on overwriting ("shadows danced like forgotten dreams") and creates minor coherence issues. A few phrases feel slightly redundant ("quivered," "tremble," "quake"). Momentum remains strong, and the closure is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor artifact: the phrase "kelp-drift peace" is repeated, creating a slight template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful, though slightly dense in peaks, but clarity remains unharmed.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwritten with dense figurative language; some repetition ("blithe," "velveteen") feels pattern-taught rather than artifact. Rhythm supports accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is rich and rhythmic but occasionally over-relies on figurative language, leading to minor overwriting in peak beats without harming overall clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic but has minor overwriting, such as repetitive use of "thistled calm," which slightly dulls momentum without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and vivid with strong rhythm, but figurative language occasionally overloads beats (e.g., "forgotten bookmarks" simile). No major loops or scaffolds, and closure remains clear. Overwriting triggers a minor deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "synapses firing like new buds" following the dense celestial description) creates a mild figurative muddle, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. However, minor overwriting occurs in peaks, such as the slightly mixed metaphor "words spilling like honey from a cracked comb" following the "unbidden" revelation. This creates a minor figurative muddle in a key beat, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for a tendency toward slightly overwrought phrasing (e.g., "elixirs of memory," "hushed reverence that blazed like embers under ash") which, while beautiful, occasionally leans into decorative density in high-pressure beats, slightly obscuring immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere cohesively.

No scaffold sentences or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density, though it occasionally leans into abstraction ("the texture of a missed opportunity"). A minor figurative muddle occurs in the peak beat describing the rupture as "peeling back layers of infinity like onion skin," which slightly softens the conceptual clarity. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and advance character and atmosphere with concision. No loops or scaffolding artifacts were detected.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose has high density and rhythmic control; figurative language is purposeful without muddle. Minor overwriting in peaks doesn't harm closure; no loops or scaffolds.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor artifact exists: the slightly elevated diction in the climax ("verdant vignettes," "preserved envy") creates a small register drift that momentarily dulls the immediacy of the high-stakes action, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific diction. Minor artifact: the phrase "bleak exhilaration" is repeated three times, creating a slight template cadence that dulls its impact slightly on final use. Otherwise, information density is high and propulsion is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid but has minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "repulsive allure" repetition). Information density is high, with sentences advancing story. No severe loops or artifacts, though some figurative language slightly muddles clarity in the confession beat.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a pattern of dense figurative language in high-pressure beats ("sapphire shards," "forgotten melody," "cryptic script") creates a slight cumulative effect of overwriting that, while beautiful, marginally slows the propulsion of the climax. There are no loops, scaffolds, or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and dense, but suffers from minor figurative overload in high-pressure beats (e.g., "silhouettes fracturing like flawed glass").

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("ivy... like possessive fingers") is purposeful and coherent. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts were detected; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. One minor artifact: the phrase "interlaced absences" is repeated, though it functions as a purposeful motif. The sentence-level propulsion is flawless, and the description is woven seamlessly into action.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong sensory selection. However, it occasionally strains under its own poetic weight, such as in the phrase "dappled—shadowed by doubt yet resolute in its quiet determination," creating a slight register drift from the POV's voice. This minor artifact prevents a higher score, though clarity and momentum are never truly lost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm advancing the story. Minor overwriting risks (e.g., "luminous torment" repetition) do not obscure closure, and there are no significant loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, but slight overwriting and repetition of phrases like "bleak exhilaration" create minor artifacts without obscuring closure. Information density is high, and propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely vivid and purposeful, with high information density. However, some overwriting is present: "brilliant dimness" is repeated, and phrases like "resonance of identity" verge on therapy-speak. A template cadence is detected in adjacent sentences starting with "The pull" and "The drone," causing a minor deduction. The closure beat remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, though minor overwriting ("sky bleeding into the sea like ink in water" verges on decorative). No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story efficiently. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("veils of mist like forgotten regrets") is purposeful, and peak beats maintain clarity despite elevated diction.

    Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm. Figurative language ("creaking like a reluctant confession") is purposeful and pattern-taught. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure causality or closure. Information density is high, with every sentence advancing character or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for the slightly repetitive use of "delicately robust" and the phrase "jaded wonder," which, while thematic, is stated explicitly. The closure beat, however, is executed with clarity and power, unobscured by these minor artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic but has minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "paradoxically steady" repeated thrice) that slightly dull momentum without harming closure. Information density is high, and figurative language is pattern-taught, but template cadence incurs a small deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent, with lines doing multiple jobs. A minor tendency toward ornate description ("beautiful yet suffocating in their infinite whisper") creates occasional slight drag, but momentum is largely maintained, and closure is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for slight adjective stacking ("ghostly resolve" appears twice) and a near-paraphrase loop ("ghosts of the past" / "ghosts of long-extinguished lives"). However, information density is high, and momentum is maintained throughout. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally trends toward overwriting (e.g., "stars wheeling in silent pirouettes across the velvet sky"), applying decorative pressure that slightly dulls the closure's clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, but slight overwriting with stacked modifiers like "calmly inventive grace" creates minor density without obscuring clarity. No major loops or artifacts harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, e.g., "aurora pulsed like veins of cosmic blood" without muddle. Sentences advance story and character efficiently. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly evocative and dense, but this density sometimes borders on overwriting, with a few mixed metaphors ("storm-kissed wonder, a furious tranquility"). The rhythm is generally strong, though occasional adjective stacks slightly impede momentum. The closure image, however, remains sharp and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional overwriting (e.g., "dignified chaos" repetition) slightly dulls momentum. No major artifacts harm closure; sentence variety supports rhythm, and information density is high with concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly accomplished, with vivid, poetic imagery and strong rhythmic control. Information density is high, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a few instances of synonym churn ("fractured glows," "luminous fracture") and a slightly over-written phrase ("the anarchy of confined souls") that briefly stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly polished, with excellent rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, a minor artifact exists: a slight over-reliance on compound-complex sentences and stacked metaphors in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a relic of vows dissolved in the fog of forgotten promises") creates occasional density that slightly impedes propulsion. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the clarity of the closure beat, where the language becomes more direct and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)

There’s occasional density/purple tilt (snowmelt ardor repeated, stacked modifiers) that could be pared for thrust. Minimal redundancy and no scaffold loops that obscure the closure. Punctuation and syntax remain tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line craft is generally strong, with purposeful imagery and rhythmic variation. Occasional purple stacking and echo (“precisely playful,” reiterated symbolic frames) creates minor density bloat without obscuring sense. Information carries multiple jobs often, and syntax stays clear through the dream sequence. The final image threads motifs cleanly with no muddled metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lines are often elegant and dense, but some are purple-adjacent, with motif reiterations that add little (“empirically ironic” appears multiple times without new torque). Information density is good; actions are clear; cadence generally supports accumulation. Minor redundancy and ornament slightly dull peak beats’ sharpness. No major grammatical or sequencing issues.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lines are mostly clean and economical; images do multi-duty (silence as constraint, broken pin as conduit). Some abstract formulations and reiterations (“shifting grace,” “cellular memory” as concept) slightly blur urgency. No major loops or syntactic monotony, but a touch of purple rises in peak beats. Copy is precise and readable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level texture is rich and mostly efficient; images often do multiple jobs. Minor repetition/purple notes (“glass,” “fog,” “frost”) risk redundancy but don’t obscure causality. Syntax varies and momentum holds through the meditative turn. A crisper cut in a few near-duplicate beats could further tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but purposeful; sentences carry multiple jobs (world, theme, action) with minimal redundancy. Occasional heightened phrases risk purple but remain coherent and image-consistent. Momentum is maintained through specific verbs and tool/body details. The final cadence lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally strong and economical, with vivid images and clean mechanics. Some repetition and purple notes (“simply complicated,” “brightened disquiet,” “forbidden knowledge”) create minor synonym loops and abstraction in peak beats. Information density is good, but a few thematic lines tell what images already show. Momentum holds, yet occasional overwriting blunts edge.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences carry strong imagery and momentum; most lines do multiple jobs. Occasional metaphor stacking (music/page/vein/echo) pushes toward excess but rarely muddies sense. Redundancies are minimal, and syntax varies. A slightly easier yield at the end reads smooth rather than sharpened, trimming the final beat’s blade.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong image economy (“Ferris wheel cars dangling like broken dreams”). Occasional purple density and motif reiterations create mild redundancy and abstraction (repeats of “unkindled solace,” conceptual clusters). Syntax variety and momentum are good; no significant scaffolding or loops. The final image is clear, if more conceptual than tactile in its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, concrete nouns, and images doing multiple jobs. Occasional repetition (“warmly methodical,” “fables of absence”) and decorative modifiers slightly thicken the texture. Syntax varies well and momentum is preserved through action-integration. No figurative muddle or scaffold that obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lines carry strong imagery with decent information density; most sentences do more than one job. A few metaphoric clusters (“hammered repose,” “storm,” “flowering”) recur, risking lushness without muddle. Minimal scaffolding or looped statements, and syntax varies to maintain propulsion. The prose remains clear at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lines carry good density—objects, world, and intent often do double duty. Some stacked modifiers and thematic restatements flirt with redundancy (“coincidences… quiet language”), but momentum holds. Syntax varies and images are coherent; no figurative muddle at the peak. Minor tightening could sharpen escalation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line craft is polished with strong image-work and purposeful cadence. Some purple drift and repetition (“preemptively nostalgic,” “deepening hush”) introduce minor density drag. No syntactic errors; information density is generally high. A touch more pruning around reiterated motifs would sharpen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.6)
    Generally elegant lines with strong verb-noun choices and multi-tasking images. However, there’s measurable purple drift and repetition clusters (“playful yet purposeful,” “ambient awareness”) that could be tightened. Crucially, the appended meta sentence about word count is a visible artifact that breaks immersion in the final stretch. Trim redundancies and remove the artifact to restore high-band polish.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is polished with strong images and efficient repetition motifs (pause, reflection, texture) that generally earn their place. A few phrases risk abstraction or purple hue and lightly echo themselves (“texture of time,” “transition periods”), causing minor redundancy. Syntax varies and propulsion holds through a quiet scene. No mixed metaphors or copy slips impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry layered work with few redundancies; rhythm breathes with the scene’s float-and-tighten. Figurative density is high but coherent with the premise; metaphors align (silence as flavor, hush as bloom) without mixing. Minimal scaffold and clean mechanics. A trace of purple risk is contained by consistent patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and purposeful, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. A few repeated phrasings (“vaulting hush,” “in transit”) are motif rather than loop, and imagery stays coherent. The line “to teach silence how to comfort” risks abstraction, but is grounded by subsequent action. Clarity holds under pressure; no figurative muddle at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    Vivid lines abound, yet purple density and paraphrase tendencies appear, and the meta count/length asides are clear artifacts that puncture momentum.

Minor trimming could heighten clarity under peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.0)
    Many lines carry efficient atmosphere and action, but momentum stutters with artifact-like insertions and recap toggles (“Wait… adjusting for count”). Minor redundancy in thematic phrasing and a few stacked modifiers blur urgency. Clean syntax otherwise, with good verb choices and tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, integrated imagery, and momentum without scaffold. A dense metaphor field risks purple in places, but coherence holds and repetitions serve motif (frost, glass, rustling). No major loops or cadence templates dulling tension. Final image lands cleanly with charged specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lines carry rich texture and generally high information density; images often do double duty for world and theme. There is some purple stacking (“filigreed stone…frozen screams,” “burnished sorrow”) and occasional redundancy, but clarity and momentum remain intact. Sentence rhythm varies, and key beats are dramatized rather than summarized. Minor excess prevents a higher mark.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lines carry high information density with few redundancies; rhythm varies and supports momentum. Imagery is mostly clean and congruent with the established physics of the piece.

No figurative muddle interferes with clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is often strong but trends purple with reiterative phrasing (“reverie,” “trap,” “tension”) and stacked modifiers. The meta parenthetical about tally adjustments is a significant artifact that punctures immersion and tone. Some synonym loops and intensifiers could be trimmed for propulsion. Syntax variety and image density are solid otherwise.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are clean and purposeful, with a few memorable images and minimal grammatical noise. There is some abstraction and repetition (“false comfort,” “working memory” as a label) and a touch of purple in places, but not to the point of muddle. Information density is decent; a few summary lines compress well. Sharper verb choices and trimming redundant concepts would improve propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lines are dense yet purposeful; images often do double duty (grooves as veins, echo as bridge). A few phrases verge on repeated motif-labeling (“wild hush,” “tinted revelations”), but they also scaffold pattern. Clarity holds through the peak beats, and there’s little scaffolding or synonym churn. Overall momentum and music are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences carry atmosphere and action with good density, though a few verge on purple and repeat constructs (“echoed silence,” stacked modifiers). Clarity never collapses, and transitions are clean. The prose could tighten by trimming echoes and a couple of explanatory lines. Final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lines are polished and image-rich, with solid momentum through varied sentence lengths. Occasional purple stacking and near-redundant phrasing (“fjord quiet,” “razor edges”) slightly dull edge and pace. Figurative logic holds, and syntax remains clean. Minor trims would heighten propulsion at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lines often do double duty and rhythm modulates well, integrating technical detail without sludge. However, a bracketed/meta sentence (“But wait, 815 is over…”) is a significant artifact that breaks immersion and dulls the closure image. Some metaphor repetition (glow/wildfire) and a few explanatory sentences could tighten. Clean mechanics overall but the artifact is costly at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong sentences with sensory density, but purple edges and abstraction recur (“lucid contradictions,” “aperture,” “responsible gamble”), creating mild redundancy and thesis drift.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and musical, with strong imagery density and generally clean syntax. Some purple tendencies and adjective stacks risk redundancy, but clarity holds. Momentum is maintained without scaffold loops. Final lines resolve by image rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lines are polished with strong images (“letters blooming like frost flowers”), but figurative density and repeated phrases (“scattered light,” floor-by-floor cataloging) verge on overwriting. Minimal redundancy creeps in with near-duplicate cadences during the ascent. Rhythm holds momentum and syntax varies. No major artifacts or muddled metaphors at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lines are generally tight, multi-tasking description with action and interiority. A few intensifiers and reiterations (“dusty starlight,” explicit “He had proven it”) flirt with purple and reduce the final image’s restraint. Syntax and paragraphing vary with good mouthfeel. No major scaffold or filter-verb stacking; momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished, image-dense, and mostly efficient; sensory selection advances both action and theme.

The closing cadence lands cleanly on a charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences carry good density and momentum; images often do double duty. Some ornamental phrasing and phrase-reuse (“brambled hope,” nebula invocations) introduce minor drag. No major loops or template cadences; clarity remains high. Rhythm varies with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line work is polished and sensuous with strong image economy; syntax varies and clarity holds. However, intensifier clusters (hush, bruise, nested patterns) approach purple density at times and create faint echo-loops. The prose keeps momentum but could cut a few near-duplicates for greater propulsion. Final image lands cleanly despite lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is generally vivid and efficient, integrating image with action; the no-touch mechanics are clearly conveyed. Some purple density skirts excess but remains coherent. The late meta-text about word counts is a glaring artifact in the final beats, dulling the closure image and rhythm. Minor repetition is motif-driven rather than filler, but the artifact warrants a significant deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean and economical, with high image density and largely efficient sentences. A few near-repetitions and overt thematic restatements slightly slow momentum (“as the pieces fell into place” echoes). Figurative layering stays coherent; no mixed metaphors that blur sense. Final rhythms land without scaffolding clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is polished with purposeful imagery and minimal scaffold.

The final cadence lands without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lines are musical and dense, often doing multiple jobs, but figurative language is very frequent and occasionally redundant (“intuitively descriptive” repeats; some metaphors overlap). Momentum holds, yet a leaner cut could heighten propulsion. No major grammatical or clarity issues. The final image is clean despite lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and varied cadence; images usually carry multiple jobs. Occasional motif repetition (“undercurrent of wisdom,” “wildflower hush”) risks redundancy but doesn’t stall momentum. Figurative control holds under pressure, and action order remains clear. Slight overwriting in the last paragraph prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean sentences with good momentum; information density is solid and images carry multiple jobs. Occasional purple tilt and motif repetition (“whirling silence,” “echoes”) skim redundancy but don’t obscure causality. Syntax and paragraphing breathe with the action. No significant artifacts or muddled metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is controlled and often elegant, with strong image-economy and instrument detail doing double duty.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lines are musical and mostly economical, with good multi-function images. Some phrase recycling (“raveling silence,” “stoically sparkling,” “recommence”) verges on redundancy and slight purpleing. Momentum remains intact and closure image is clear. Minor pruning could heighten propulsion without dulling texture.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery, but there’s occasional purple tilt and repetition that could be pared (“defiance” and “azure” recur). Momentum holds, yet some lines restate stakes or mood without adding pressure. Syntax varies adequately and copy is clean. Density is good; a touch of pruning would sharpen peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid and largely precise; images (glass refracting like neural pathways) carry multiple jobs. There is some redundancy and purple tint in repeated constructs (“cyclically spontaneous,” “redirected”), and a few declarative summaries blur sharpness at peak beats. Momentum mostly holds, sentences vary, and the final cadence lands cleanly. Minor trimming could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are clear, texturally rich, and generally purposeful; images often do double duty. Occasional purple tendencies and repeated constructions (“luminescent ache,” “reticent”) slightly blunt freshness. Momentum holds, with minimal scaffold or loops. The final cadence is clean and image-led.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lines are musical with high information density and purposeful repetitions, and the final cadence lands cleanly. Some figurative stacking and intensifiers create mild purple drift and small redundancy (“ancient shadows,” “otherworldly routine” reiterated). Despite this, syntax varies and images remain coherent, preserving propulsion. Minor trims could sharpen pressure at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lines carry rich image-density and purposeful cadence, with strong noun-verb choices. Some metaphor stacking and repeated intensifiers (“quietly explosive,” “shimmer”) flirt with overwriting and minor redundancy, slightly softening propulsion. Clarity remains intact; no significant scaffold loops or filter stacks. The final image is clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished, image-rich, and mostly efficient; sentences often do double duty. Metaphor density is high but coherent to the governing motifs (moonlight, measurement, sorrow). A few lines flirt with purple (“quantified sorrow,” “spilled mercury”), yet clarity and momentum hold. No notable loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line-level craft is often lush and purposeful, but density of figurative language risks purple patches. More significantly, the bracketed meta lines in the final third are overt scaffolding that disrupt momentum and dull the closure image. Minor redundancy exists, though most sentences carry weight. Proofing and cadence otherwise read strong.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clean, mostly precise lines with good momentum; images often do double duty. Repetition and abstraction creep in (“enlarged tranquility” recurs; “paradoxes nestling compassion within solitude” leans declarative). Figurative density occasionally thickens in peak beats, dulling edge. Mechanics are sound with minimal scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished, with varied syntax and strong verb-noun choices. Occasional purple touches and conceptual echoes (“uncloaking,” “secrets unveiled,” “communion”) flirt with redundancy but don’t stall momentum. Information density stays high; images do multiple jobs. The final image is clean and not obscured by figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is polished, with precise nouns and integrated action, though figurative density is high and “quartz hush” and frost motifs recur to the edge of redundancy. Sentences typically do more than one job and remain clear. A few ornamental modifiers and metaphor stacks slightly slow momentum. The final image is clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft is mostly clean, vivid, and propulsive with efficient sensory economy. However, a glaring artifact—the meta word-count sentence and bracketed note—arrives in the final paragraph, disrupting momentum and undercutting closure rhythm. Minor repetition motifs are purposeful, but the artifact requires a substantial deduction per the text-artifact guard. Otherwise, syntax and cadence vary well.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level craft is often lush and effective, but figurative density is high and occasionally redundant. The meta-bracketed word-count joke and “recalibrate/trim back” scaffolding blunt momentum and the closure image. Some descriptions restate atmosphere without adding pressure. Rhythm is varied, yet pruning would heighten propulsion and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    High information density and clear sequencing, but recurrent phrases (“auroral sorrow,” “uncork,” “inescapable calling”) and stacked metaphors flirt with overwriting. Most sentences carry multiple jobs and momentum holds. Minor redundancy and heightened diction restrain top-tier polish. Closure image remains sharp and unclouded.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lines are vivid and efficient, with multi-tasking images (e.g., “like the desiccated skins of forgotten fruits”). Occasional purple or clichéd phrasing (“irrigate the soul”) mildly blunts edge. Otherwise, syntax varies and momentum holds with minimal redundancy. Mechanics are clean and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished, with strong verb choices and layered images; repetition of “glisten/symphonies” edges toward purple but mostly sustains effect. Sentences vary and propel rather than stall. Minimal scaffold or loops and clean mechanics. A touch more restraint at peak lyric claims would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lines are vivid and mostly efficient, with good propulsion through technical and sensory detail. Occasional purple clusters and synonymic intensifiers (“hummed… whispers… static surged… chaos”) create minor redundancy. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles confuse action. The final third remains clear and charged despite the elevated texture.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong momentum and clear syntax; images generally carry multiple jobs. Some purple turns and light cliché (“dew-kissed flowers,” reiterated “sandstorm calm”) and one or two abstracted phrases reduce density. No major loops or filter stacks; the closure image is clean. Minor tightening could elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lines are polished with high image density; most sentences do multiple jobs. Occasional purple edges and repeated motifs (“calm defiance,” spider-web) add a touch of redundancy. Rhythm varies well and sequencing is clear; no major artifact loops. The prose carries momentum without choking on its own figurative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lines carry multiple jobs (image, world logic, emotion) with clean syntax and momentum. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent; sensory detail is precise. Minor repetition (“gleaming silence”) functions as motif rather than a loop. No clarity issues or scaffold padding dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lines often carry multiple jobs and rhythm varies, but figurative density and repetitive intensifiers creep toward purple. The final meta line is a clear artifact that dulls the closure image. Minor paraphrase-redundancies (“whispered secrets,” “coded”) recur. Overall clarity holds, yet momentum is softened by ornamental phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is controlled, image-rich, and largely free of loops; details often do double duty (wax as craft and pact). A few modifiers and set-piece phrases flirt with purple, but clarity and momentum hold. Syntax varies and paragraphing breathes with the scene’s turns. The closing image is clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and multi-function lines, but lush modifiers and repeated abstractions (“quarantined memories,” “tragically radiant”) verge on excess. Minimal scaffold; information density stays high. Figurative language largely coheres without mixed metaphors. Minor redundancy and adornment slightly slow momentum in mid-paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-by-line craft is strong with high information density in images and actions. Some synonym/phrase loops and stacked modifiers (“pearl twilight,” multiple luminance descriptors) create mild purple overgrowth that slightly slows momentum. Core beats stay clear and the closing image is intact. Trimming a few near-duplicates would sharpen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line craft is often musical, but there’s redundancy in tonal descriptors (melancholy, reeds, winds) and stacked modifiers. The explanatory block about Echo Weavers leans tell-y, though serviceable. Most damaging is the blatant meta artifact (“[600-800 achieved…]”), which breaks immersion and cadence in the final third. Overall readability holds, but polish is required to meet elite standards.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and largely controlled metaphor. A few phrases edge toward purple (“silvered melancholy,” “borrowed starlight”), but coherence holds and no loops blunt momentum. Syntax varies and sequencing remains clear.

Final cadence is clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.9)
    Vivid imagery and purposeful diction coexist with overwriting and occasional redundancy. The late meta artifacts (“But wait… proper count…”) disrupt momentum and dull the closure image. Some figurative stacking skews purple, though clarity mostly holds. Tightening and removing scaffolding would markedly elevate line quality.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    High information density with recurring images doing double duty, but figurative layering sometimes stacks (“etched,” “scar,” “veils,” “shards”) to near-saturation. Some summary loops (“variant allegiances” and “dawn” refrains) dull momentum. Syntax varies enough to keep flow, and clarity holds through the climax. Minor overwriting reduces peak crispness.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs (image + action + theme), and the read-aloud rhythm is varied. Occasional purple gleam and echoing phrases (“positively wistful,” “lonesome splendor”) flirt with redundancy but don’t obscure causality. No significant scaffold or template-cadence loops. Clarity and momentum hold to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lines are generally clear with good momentum, and images often do double duty (environment + emotion). However, modifier stacks and repeated abstractions (“fleshly,” “ethereal,” “resonance”) verge on overwriting. Some paraphrase-like reiterations (explaining sonic absolution) slow intensity. Strong craft overall, but the lushness blunts peak sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lines carry multiple jobs—world, theme, and action—without sludge. Occasional purple tendencies are contained and pattern-consistent; syntax varies and momentum holds. No disruptive loops or figurative muddle at the close. A touch more concision in recurring imagery could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)

No major loops or figurative muddle; momentum holds through the vision. Minor purple notes don’t impair clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished with strong image economy; lines often do double duty (setting/theme). A few purple-leaning metaphors (“vibrant hush,” “brass veins”) repeat, but coherence holds and momentum doesn’t stall. Syntax varies and read-aloud rhythm is strong. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs—world, theme, and motion—without heavy scaffolding or loops; cadence varies and reads aloud cleanly. Figurative stacks are frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (evolution/acid/mechanics). Minor repetition of concepts (“evolution,” “yearning”) skirts excess yet does not dull the closure image. Mechanics and sequencing are clear and proofed.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clear, paced, and largely economical, with recurring images working as a pattern rather than purple excess. Occasional echoing (“echo of forgotten songs,” “ghosts”) is intentional and not scaffolding. Sentences do multi-task, moving plot and tone together. A touch more syntactic variety at peak beats could add propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong—precise images, varied rhythm—but tends toward lushness that occasionally borders on purple. The bracketed meta about word counts near the end is a clear artifact that breaks immersion and dulls the closing cadence. Otherwise, sentences carry multiple functions with decent economy.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are specific and purposeful, with few redundancies. Occasional lushness (“world had tilted…,” “windborne solace”) skirts purple but remains coherent and voice-motivated. Syntax varies and momentum rarely stalls. No distracting loops or register drift at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line work is mostly tight with varied rhythm and high image-to-ink ratio. A few metaphors lean familiar (“words flowing like the slow pour of aged wine,” “fields whispering”), edging toward purple but not derailing momentum. Syntax and paragraphing pace the conversation effectively. No notable loops, scaffolds, or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and image-dense with good momentum for a ritual scene. Occasional purple risk and near-redundancies (“murmurs,” “clearings”) slightly over-enrich but don’t blur causality. Syntax varies and sentences multi-task efficiently. Final image is clean and not muddled by metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and readable, but purple tendencies (“earnest whimsy,” “alchemized”) and motif repetition create mild redundancy. Several sentences restate similar ideas (vines reclaiming/Elara reclaiming) without new pressure. Syntax varies enough to maintain flow. No mechanical errors, but some tightening would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished and mostly economical, with sentences doing multiple jobs. Some repetition and purple tilt—“suspended hush,” “weathered innocence,” and echo-laden metaphors—create slight density drag. Clarity and sequence remain clean, and the final image lands. Trimming redundancies would heighten propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lines are taut and purposeful; most sentences carry dual duty (image + pressure). Minor repetition (“tidal longing,” “hush”) brushes purple but remains pattern-consistent. Syntax varies and momentum holds through the ending image. No scaffolding or coherence breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is lush yet mostly purposeful; sentences carry multiple jobs and momentum rarely stalls. A couple of factual slips (32 km/s for Earth escape; “lunar” vs. high-atmosphere perch) introduce credibility noise. Figurative density stays coherent, but occasional intensifiers verge on ornamental. Closing beats remain clear despite these nicks.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and musical, with high information density and clean sequencing. At times it leans purple, repeating motifs (“pulsing stillness,” “radiant”) and layering modifiers. Still, images often carry multiple jobs (setting, theme, emotion). Momentum holds through the close.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and image-rich, with good momentum through a mostly expository puzzle beat. Some repetition (“quietly deliberate”; concept echoes like “sealed awakenings,” “loops”) and occasional purple flourishes create mild density drag. Sentences generally do more than one job, though a few could compress. The closing lines land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lines are generally precise and musical, with strong image economy. Minor overwriting and motif repetition in the final third (abstractions like “destiny,” “innovative shape”) slow momentum. Syntax varies well, and information density is high. No major clarity issues or scaffold, just occasional purple tint.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is lush with layered metaphors (“zephyr bloom,” “prismatic whispers”) yet generally clear and purposeful. Occasional density edges toward overwriting, but cadence and momentum mostly hold. Repetition of key motifs supports structure rather than padding. No major scaffolding or loop artifacts impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished, with layered images doing double duty (icicles as method; amber as re-priced symbol). A few lush stacks (“emerald cushions,” “honeyed glow,” “gentle symphony”) flirt with purple, but control and clarity hold. Sentences vary in length and propulsion; little to no scaffold or loop. The final cadence lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is lush and mostly precise; images do more than one job and carry momentum. However, density verges on purple in runs and recycles key terms, creating mild redundancy. No major clarity issues, but variation and the occasional plainer line would sharpen pressure. The closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level is generally clear and musical, with strong image-work (threads of light, silver/gold kiss). Some over-richness and near-repetitions (hush, golden, alignment) risk purple drift and dilute propulsion. Syntax patterns recur but do not obscure causality. Momentum holds, yet density could be trimmed for sharper escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs, imagery is mostly coherent, and momentum persists through lyric density. There’s some repetition of “moving stillness” textures and stacked modifiers that slightly thicken the middle. Clarity survives the peak beat; no scaffold loops. Trimming a handful of intensifiers would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lines carry strong image density, varied cadence, and clean syntax; many sentences do multiple jobs. A few phrases edge toward lushness and repetition (“peripheral,” “lull”), but they serve the motif rather than padding. Minimal scaffold or loops; momentum holds through iterative method. The final sentence resolves by image rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong with high information density; images often do double duty (lamp as tool and lens). Minor overwriting and repetition risk (“shingled hush” is reiterated) but are motif-driven rather than padding. Syntax varies and momentum holds, though a few metaphor stacks verge on excess. Mechanics are clean with no clarity slips in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and purposeful figurative language. The “crystal” motif repeats but functions structurally rather than as purple redundancy. Minimal scaffold and no causal blur; the final image is crisp. Occasional elevated phrasing stays within the voice and scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished, rhythmic, and mostly high-density; images earn their keep. Occasional ornamentation edges toward purple, but the figurative web is coherent with few redundancies. Sentences vary and propel momentum through the negotiation. No major loops or scaffold artifacts blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean and mostly propulsive, with purposeful sensory specifics and strong verbs. Some metaphor density (“maze of intentions,” “bath of stoic wonder,” recurrent “hum”) feels repetitive and slightly purple, softening momentum. Clarity stays intact and syntax varies, but trimming a few abstractions would sharpen impact. The final line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level craft is often lush and purposeful, but leans into purple repetition (“glacial hush,” “excruciatingly gentle”) and modifier stacking that could be pared. The prose maintains momentum via image, yet redundancy occasionally stalls. Crucially, the meta word-count intrusions in the final lines are a severe artifact that breaks immersion and blunts closure. Clean-up and tightening would significantly elevate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lines are clean, with varied syntax and strong verb choices; images carry multiple jobs (mood, theme, action). Some purple tendencies and light repetition (“serene upheaval” appears multiple times) slightly dull momentum. No major loops or scaffolding, and sequence is clear during the dive and recovery. The final paragraph compresses insight efficiently without devolving into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lines are polished and musical with strong image density, and most sentences carry multiple jobs. Some figurative stacking trends lush (“spectral fingers,” “bind of forgotten stars,” “bioluminescent creatures”) and risks saturation, modestly slowing momentum. Clarity survives; scaffolding and loops are minimal. Variations in sentence rhythm keep it from becoming uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush with strong image density; most lines carry multiple jobs (setting, theme, character). Occasional saturation of metaphor (“lonesome splendor,” “cartographer of scars”) edges toward excess but doesn’t muddle sense. Minimal redundancy and clean syntax keep momentum for a lyric piece. The final image is crisp and not overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lines are largely tight and image-rich, with strong verb choices and minimal scaffolding. There’s mild purpleing and motif repetition (“hypothesized,” “flawed genesis,” “reverie”) that inch toward redundancy. Syntax varies enough to keep momentum, and the final image is clean. A touch more pruning would sharpen charge without losing music.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished with purposeful imagery and varied rhythm; most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, character, theme). There is some density creep toward purple, but metaphors align and avoid muddle. A few near-repetitions (“gracefully alert,” thematic assertions) lightly slow momentum. Overall clarity and propulsion hold.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-craft is strong and musical, with purposeful imagery and minimal scaffolding. Occasional purple-density and motif repetition nudge toward heaviness but do not obscure sense. Sentences carry multiple jobs and maintain momentum. The final crack-and-bloom image is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lines are polished and musical with strong image density, and syntax varies. However, repeated metaphoric clusters (sigh/petals/patterns) verge on overuse, softening propulsion. A few adjacent paraphrase echoes slightly dull momentum. Grammar and clarity are clean, with no mechanics slips.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished with rich, coherent imagery (“thundering calm,” “living punctuation”). Minor density and repetition nudge toward purple in places, but momentum holds and clarity remains intact. Few to no scaffold sentences or template cadences; information density is high. Final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies well, and lines carry multiple jobs (world, emotion, symbol) with good economy. A few phrases flirt with purple (“searing reverie,” repeated “incremental absolution”), but they do not obscure action or cost. No significant loops or template cadences slow momentum. The final image is clean and un-muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level craft is often lush but drifts into redundancy and ornament (“velveteen gloom,” “plush velvet”), and some sentences do single-duty. The parentheses about cutting and word count feel like scaffold, dulling momentum and the final cadence. Figurative density occasionally blurs focus, though clarity of action largely holds. A tighter, cleaner final third would considerably raise impact.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished, image-dense, and mostly double-duty; sentences advance both mood and thought. Minor redundancy in conceptual phrasing (constraint/innovation, modeling reiterated) but not loop-level. Figurative language is coherent and controlled; no mixed metaphors dull the climax. Momentum carries cleanly into the charged final line.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is largely clean, with purposeful repetition (“thistled calm,” “secretly luminous”) and strong image economy. Some redundancy and adjective stacking verge on ornamental, and a few phrases echo content already delivered. Momentum holds, but the density could be trimmed to heighten pressure beats. Syntax and cadence vary enough to avoid monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, sensory layering, and multi-tasking sentences that both image and advance intent. Minor repetition of illusion/safety motifs brushes up against purple but doesn’t blur meaning. Pacing tightens toward closure; no scaffold or cadence loops interrupt momentum. Final image is clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density and purposeful imagery; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, psyche, stakes). Some phrases flirt with purple (“indifferent drip of eternity,” “abrasive calm” repeated), but clarity and momentum hold. Syntax varies and cadence supports escalation. Minimal scaffold or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful imagery, and motifs doing double duty. Minor lushness and reiterative phrasing appear but don’t stall momentum or blur sense. Sentences vary in length and cadence, and paragraphs carry load without scaffold. The final line resolves by image rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is largely clean and vivid with strong verbs and layered images; several sentences do double-duty (atmosphere + motive). There’s mild purple drift and reiteration of ideas (“gentle rebellion,” “beauty from ruins”) that could be leaner. Syntax and paragraphing maintain momentum across the night-to-dawn arc.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lines carry high information density with few redundancies; images pull double duty (lantern-hive, bees/bolts). Figurative language is lush but mostly disciplined, avoiding muddle. Cadence varies and momentum holds through the reveal. Minor flourish risk remains but doesn’t obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lines are dense but purposeful; images do multiple jobs (streetlights “daydreaming” sets tone and time). Minimal redundancy and clean syntax keep momentum despite lyricism. Occasional lushness risks purple but remains coherent and legible. Final cadence is crisp and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level craft is often strong—precise verbs, layered images, and multi-tasking sentences. Some abstraction creep and thematic declaration reduce density in peak beats. Crucially, the meta “word count” postscript is a significant artifact in the final lines, disrupting cadence and closure. This late intrusion materially dulls the ending’s image and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs with good propulsion; imagery is mostly precise. Minor redundancy (reiterated “perpetual motion,” “texture”) and a few purple-leaning flourishes slightly thicken the surface. Syntax and paragraphing breathe with the scene’s needs. The final image is clean and not dulled by figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level is polished and imagistic, with strong nouns and purposeful verbs tied to tactile actions. Some metaphor stacking and lush modifiers (e.g., repeated “saffron,” “veiled,” “haze”) verge on excess and could be trimmed for torque. Minimal paraphrase looping, though a few sentiments echo in successive clauses. Momentum holds, but density at peaks slightly blurs edge and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lines are vivid and purposeful, with strong image economy (emerald refractions; corroded flecks). Some repeated constructs (“historically oriented,” “rosewater dread”) verge on motif rather than redundancy, but the prose largely avoids loops and purple excess. Syntax variety sustains momentum into the climax. A few stacked modifiers could be pruned for even tighter thrust.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lines are mostly tight, with strong image-to-function density (tools, filaments of “fossilized light,” tide breathing). Repetition of key terms (“latent radiance,” “bleak exhilaration,” “counter clockwise”) occasionally edges toward redundancy. Prose remains clear at the climax and avoids muddled metaphors. Momentum is maintained; minimal scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.6)
    Line-level vividness is high, but modifiers stack and figurative density sometimes blur pressure. Paraphrase/patch artifacts in the final third (“Wait… recalibrate… Adjust… Too long—refine.”) interrupt momentum and dull the closure image. Some redundancy and purple phrasing creep in. Syntax and clarity are generally clean outside those artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is lush yet mostly precise; images pull multiple duties (soundscape, tactic, theme). A few phrases verge on purple or lightly repetitive (“restless euphony” recurrence), but momentum holds and syntax varies. Information density is high without obscuring cause/effect. The final cadence is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lines are generally tight, image-dense, and purposeful; many sentences carry multiple jobs (world, pressure, theme). Occasional lushness risks purple (“golden haze… masked the rot”) but coherence holds and propulsion is maintained. Minimal redundancy and clear sequencing in the climax. Final image is clean and charged without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and image-rich with good momentum; metaphors are mostly controlled and purposeful (windows as “broken promises” is borderline but fits the motif). Minor redundancy (“emotionally rational”) and thematic reiteration could be trimmed. Sentence variety and paragraph pacing carry the scene cleanly. No significant artifacts or loops dull the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lines often do double duty—image and action—but tilt purple at times (“hushed blaze,” motif reiterations). Strong sensory specificity carries momentum through most of the piece. The bracketed word-count/meta adjustments in the final lines are artifacts that jar rhythm and dull the closure image. Minor redundancy clusters (“stoic/stoically”) and intensifier stacking further slow the finish.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished with clean syntax, purposeful imagery, and strong nouns/verbs. A few motif repetitions (“reclaimed stillness,” “dappled”) flirt with echo, but most sentences do double duty. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and scene-anchored. Momentum holds without scaffolding clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: verbs do work, images are specific, and most sentences carry multiple loads (world, action, theme). Mild density/purple-edge (“luminous torment” recurrences, stacked metaphors) occasionally slows momentum but doesn’t obscure sense. No major loops or scaffolding; syntax varies. Final image is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lines often carry dual duty (world + psyche), and syntax generally propels. However, recurrent phrasework (“intangibly tangible,” “bleak exhilaration”) and stacked modifiers verge on overwriting, softening impact. Minor paraphrase echoes occur across adjacent sentences. Despite this, clarity at the climax is maintained and momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean and often elegant, with strong noun-verb choices and integrated imagery. Some repetition and purple edging (“brilliant dimness,” “veins,” “whispered who one truly was”) nudge toward overornament in high-pressure beats. A few paraphrase-adjacent lines restate process without adding new pressure. Momentum largely survives, and the final image is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, image-rich, and largely efficient; sentences carry multiple loads (setting, psyche, motif). There’s minor purple tint and a couple near-redundant intensifiers, but momentum holds. Figurative logic stays coherent and supports the accumulative lens. The final line is crisp and earned without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, tactile nouns, and imagery that mostly earns its keep. A few phrases flirt with purple or redundancy (mist/wind motifs recur), but momentum and clarity hold. Syntax varies and the final cadence lands cleanly. No loops or scaffolded paraphrase undercut the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.3)
    Many lines carry tactile specificity and good rhythm, but there’s periodic purple edging and redundancy. The bracketed process notes and editorial asides in the final third are glaring artifacts that deflate momentum and dull the closure image. Some intensifiers and symbolic stacking (lighthouse-proposal = vows) verge on heavy-handed. Clean copy otherwise.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level is often strong and image-dense, but occasional purple stacking (recurrent “delicately robust,” piled modifiers) and a few tell-y labels drag momentum. The closing meta parentheticals are clear artifacts that dull the final image’s charge. Overall clarity holds, yet tightening repetition and cutting scaffolding would sharpen propulsion. Rhythm varies, but minor loops persist.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level craft is often strong, with rich images doing multiple jobs, but it veers toward purple in clusters and repeats “paradoxically steady.” Crucially, the bracketed editorial aside in the final lines is a damaging artifact that dulls the closure image. Some intensifiers and stacked modifiers could be trimmed for propulsion. Overall clarity holds, but momentum takes a hit.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with images doing multiple jobs and clean sequencing. The prose edges into density/purple at times (“choking beauty,” “willingly perplexed” recur), creating minor redundancy. Figurative logic holds; no major mixed metaphors, but the lushness slightly slows momentum mid-piece. Trims could tighten impact around the card revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and image-rich, with strong momentum through purposeful beats. Some repetition and stacked modifiers flirt with purple (ghostly/shimmer recur), slightly blurring edges. Sentences generally carry multiple jobs and stay clear. The final cadence lands cleanly without scaffolding detritus.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lines are polished and musical with varied rhythm, but there’s some redundancy (“vibrant hush” frequency; celestial “pirouettes” echoes) and decorative layering that could be trimmed. Figurative density occasionally over-saturates moments, softening propulsion. Syntax is clean, sequencing is clear, and images do multi-duty. Minor tightenings would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and image-rich with good momentum and selective detail. Some repetition (“winking hush,” “calm inventiveness”) and stacked metaphors risk over-saturation. Lines mostly carry multiple jobs, though a few sentences rephrase adjacent content. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lines are polished and image-forward, with solid propulsion for a lyric mode. However, clusters of modifiers and echoing motifs create mild purple pressure and occasional redundancy. Most sentences do dual work (world + action), and syntax varies. The closure paragraph reads cleanly despite lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is vivid and mostly economical; images often do double duty (timer as metronome and clock). Minor purple flares and motif reiterations risk redundancy but stay purposeful. No major loops or filter-verb stacks; momentum is maintained. The aphoristic line near the end softens sharpness but doesn’t blur closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lines carry strong sensory density and momentum, generally doing double duty. Occasional purple stretches and repetition (“dignified chaos,” “questions into destinations”) soften edge and pace. Metaphoric load stays coherent but is heavy; trimming could heighten pressure at the climax. Mechanics are clean; no confusing syntax or timeline slips.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line craft is taut and image-rich, with sentences doing dual work (atmosphere + action). Some repeated metaphoric texture (“luminous fracture,” “blooming”) edges toward overuse but doesn’t blur sense. Minimal scaffolding and good momentum for a lyric piece. The final image is clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    High-density prose largely avoids muddle; images align (tides, film, compasses) and do double duty. Minor purpleness and stacked modifiers creep in but do not blur causality. Sentence variety keeps momentum; scaffolding and loops are minimal. The final lines are clean and image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lines are mostly tight and multi-functional, with strong images and clean sequencing. Some purple drift and motif repetition (“luminous,” “empirically whimsical”) slightly over-saturate texture but do not obscure sense. Momentum holds through scene shifts without scaffolding loops. Final image is clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lines carry high information density and clean syntax; images generally cohere. There is mild purple stacking and repetition of key terms that risk sameness but do not blur causality. Momentum holds through the ritual without scaffolding or loops. Final cadence is clear and uncluttered.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with striking images like the butterfly dust catching the sun like "microscopic galaxies." The sentence-level craft effectively supports the story's quiet, methodical momentum. The score is held back slightly by the repetitive and somewhat awkward phrase "preprocesses reality," which functions as a small prose artifact that momentarily disrupts the otherwise seamless and evocative language.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong imagery. However, a few minor but noticeable artifacts detract from its polish. The line "Steadily adaptive, she adapted her artist's eye" is a clunky paraphrase loop, and the phrase "drifting resonance" is repeated in close proximity. These small redundancies slightly dull the momentum in an otherwise well-crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is often elegant and rhythmical, it is significantly undermined by repetitive prose artifacts. The phrases "unshaken marvel" and "silently expressive" are used three and four times, respectively, functioning as conceptual loops that dull the narrative's freshness and momentum. Because one of these repeated phrases appears in the final, crucial image, the penalty is severe, detracting from an otherwise strong line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and highly evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, a few minor artifacts prevent a top-tier score. The phrase "inadvertently stubborn" is repeated, a small but noticeable loop, and feels less graceful than the surrounding prose. Similarly, the word "revitalization" is a bit clinical. These are small blemishes on an otherwise polished and powerful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and polished, but it contains minor, recurring artifacts that prevent it from reaching the highest tier. The repetition of key phrases like "gently persistent" and "amplified quiet" feels programmatic rather than organic. Additionally, some figurative language, such as "threads stitching grandparents' tales to grandchildren's dreams," verges on stock metaphor, slightly thinning the otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from a lack of restraint, leading to overwriting that can dull momentum. Nearly every sentence is laden with dense figurative language ("heart a vessel for questions that bloomed like night jasmine," "breaths shallow and ragged, like wind through cracked porcelain"), which at times clutters rather than clarifies. This relentless adjectival density, a form of stylistic artifact, becomes the story’s primary flaw, preventing the clean, sharp propulsion required for the highest tier of literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from several instances of conceptual looping and lexical repetition. Key terms like "quaking reverie," "hyperbolic," and "fading photographs" are repeated to the point of diminishing returns, functioning as labels rather than allowing the imagery to do the work. This slight overwriting, especially the use of "retrocognitively," slightly dulls the otherwise sharp execution and prevents the prose from achieving full propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and clear, with strong verbs and imagery. However, it is held back by noticeable repetition artifacts that slightly dull its impact. The phrase "staggering grace" appears three times, and "patiently strategic" is used twice in close succession, which reads like a template-cadence issue. While these choices contribute to tone, their repetition feels mechanical rather than fully organic, preventing the prose from achieving flawless momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.2)
    While often evocative, the prose is frequently overwritten, with figurative language so dense it sometimes obscures meaning. The primary, and fatal, flaw is the presence of the multiple bracketed endings. This massive text artifact ("wait, no—adjusting for count," etc.) breaks the narrative completely at its most crucial moment, making it unpublishable. It is a scaffolding remnant that fundamentally undermines the story's integrity and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmically strong, but its high density of figurative language occasionally borders on being overwrought. There are minor repetitions and near-loops, such as the use of "luminous disbelief" and "glowing incredulity" in close proximity, and the repetition of "quietly savvy." While the lushness supports the tone, a slightly more restrained hand would have sharpened the story's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lyrical and demonstrates a high degree of craft, with vivid imagery and a controlled, purposeful rhythm. While the density of figurative language is generally justified by the character's voice, a few moments verge on cliché ("split like a wound that refused to heal fully"). The piece avoids major artifacts like loops or scaffolding, but this slight lack of restraint in its metaphors is a hairline flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive but is hampered by several instances of overwriting and abstract summary where concrete action would be stronger ("trembling certainty blooming into resolve"). There's a reliance on thematic labels ("transformative betrayal," "unassailable strength") that feel like authorial scaffolding. The final sentence is the most significant flaw, stating the theme directly rather than letting the final image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, yet it maintains clarity and propulsion throughout. Word choice is precise and evocative, and sentence structures vary to create a compelling rhythm. While the language is elevated, it avoids overwriting by ensuring every image serves character, atmosphere, or theme. There are no scaffold phrases or redundant loops; the information density is high, with each line contributing to the story’s powerful, cohesive effect.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.5)
    While containing moments of beautiful prose, the line-level craft is significantly weakened by prose artifacts. The repetitive use of keywords—"amalgamate," "loop," "composed," "mundane"—creates a scaffold-like effect that dulls momentum and feels programmatic. Several sentences are structured as dense exposition rather than fluid prose, particularly the one explaining the violin's function, which harms the story's overall polish.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is often luminous and evocative, but it is significantly marred by a critical prose artifact: the phrase "ambiguously clear" is repeated four times. This loop, appearing in exposition, rising action, and the climax, breaks the narrative spell and reads like a template phrase. While much of the line-level craft is strong, this severe repetition in a short piece is a flaw that would require immediate editorial intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is evocative and precise for the most part, with strong, clear imagery. However, the recurring "blooming/withering" motif, while thematically relevant, is applied so frequently that it becomes a noticeable prose artifact that slightly flattens the texture through repetition. Sentences like "commemorating small victories elaborately, transforming mundane triumphs into ceremonies" also lean toward abstract summary rather than concrete action, momentarily slowing the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear but is hindered by repetition and overwriting. Key words like "hush," "twilight," and "mechanically" are reused in close proximity, creating a slight loop effect. Some figurative language feels dense without adding precision, slightly slowing the momentum in what should be a taut, climactic scene.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with sentences that consistently perform multiple functions of characterization, atmosphere, and plot advancement. The language is elevated without feeling overwrought, and the rhythm of the prose effectively mirrors the story’s building tension. A few phrases in the climax verge on familiar supernatural imagery (“in-between spaces tore open”), but this is a minor blemish on an otherwise masterfully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, the opening paragraph is so laden with figurative language ("clouds clung like forgotten dreams," "auroral sorrow...settled over her like a veil") that it verges on overwriting, slightly impeding momentum at the outset. While the style is consistent, this initial density is the piece's only notable friction point.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmically strong, but it is marred by a noticeable repetition. The phrase "drowsy alertness" is used three times, functioning as a recurring prose artifact that, by the third mention, feels heavy-handed and breaks the immersive quality. This loop, while thematically linked, is a distinct flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, but it suffers from significant repetition of key phrases ("crumbling peace," "drift of untold seasons," "regenerative silence"). While this creates a motif, its frequency in such a short piece feels more like a prose artifact than a deliberate, deepening refrain, slightly dulling momentum. Several sentences are also overloaded with figurative language, creating density at the cost of propulsion, for instance in the description of the swan's discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often evocative and polished, with a strong rhythmic quality. However, it is weakened by a recurring prose artifact: the repeated, almost incantatory use of the story's key prompt words ("adaptive," "cautious exuberance," "ordinary magic"). This creates a scaffold-like feel, as if the story is dutifully announcing its components rather than letting them arise organically, which dulls the momentum and feels overly constructed in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density. However, its reliance on a consistently high density of figurative language and adjective-noun pairings borders on overwriting in a few passages. While the effect is largely successful, a slight paring back would have increased the propulsion and impact of the most critical images.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from a noticeable repetition of its own thematic keywords ("enigma," "transpose," "orchestrate," "flow"). This recurrence, particularly "familiar enigma," creates a template-cadence feel that slightly undermines the story's organic development. While the imagery is strong, this thematic scaffolding makes the authorial hand a little too visible, preventing the prose from achieving true seamlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often lyrical, the prose is severely hampered by scaffold-like repetition of the story's key conceptual phrases ("unraveled stillness," "muffled clarity," "hidden assumptions"). These terms are recycled verbatim across multiple paragraphs, creating distracting loops that feel more like checklist items than organic language. This significant prose artifact dulls the story's momentum and elegance, marking its biggest flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, with evocative language and a strong rhythmic control. However, the prose suffers from a very high density of figurative language, with nearly every sentence containing a simile or metaphor. This intensity, while often beautiful, occasionally verges on overwriting and creates minor conceptual redundancies (e.g., restating the "conductor" motivation), slightly impeding momentum in an otherwise stellar piece.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, with strong verbs and clear imagery. However, it suffers from a tendency toward overwriting and conceptual density, sometimes slowing momentum. Sentences like "...periodically eternal—an endless recurrence where it reset in cycles, eternal yet reborn each era, defying finality" read as expository definitions rather than narration, functioning as a prose artifact that slightly dulls the story's propulsion by explaining a concept that should be felt.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong rhythm and imagery. However, the momentum is significantly stalled by a key sentence that functions as a paraphrase loop and authorial scaffolding ("That filament of hush was her core concept, a delicate strand..."). This prose artifact breaks the narrative spell by explaining what the story is already showing.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and demonstrates good rhythmic control. Its primary weakness is a reliance on conceptual looping; keywords like "integrity," "lateral," "solitude," and "tranquility" are repeated to a degree that they feel like thematic scaffolding rather than organic language, slightly dulling the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with a high density of evocative figurative language. While this creates a powerful atmosphere, it occasionally verges on being overwritten, with some sentences feeling heavy with stacked descriptors. The primary flaw is the clunky, overly-analytical sentence that spells out the story's theme in the climax, a register drift that momentarily breaks the lyrical flow and dulls the otherwise sharp propulsion of the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, but frequently tips into being overwritten, relying on abstract nouns and modifiers ("passionate subtlety," "moral ambiguity") that dull immediacy. The primary flaw, however, is the inclusion of massive text artifacts in the final paragraphs. These bracketed authorial notes are not part of the narrative and completely obscure the story's closure, representing a critical failure in line-level craft and finish.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from significant repetition that feels like a textual artifact. Key phrases—"chronic hush" (4 times), "acoustically perceptive" (2 times), "magnificent simplicity" (2 times), "unbind" (3 times)—are reused to the point of becoming noticeable scaffolding. This loop-like quality dulls the momentum and gives the piece a slightly mechanical feel, preventing the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of immediate publishability despite its other strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong sensory details and a confident rhythm. However, there are minor but noticeable instances of conceptual repetition that act as scaffolding. The verb "subsume" and the phrase "fuse insight with empathy" are reiterated, slightly undermining the power of showing the transformation. These moments of telling, while concise, prevent the prose from achieving flawless momentum, especially when they echo the story's core concepts too explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose demonstrates a consistent rhythm but is hampered by overwriting and repetition. Phrases like "cautious exuberance" are used twice, and the density of figurative language ("salt-kissed whisper," "velvet night") can feel overwrought, slowing momentum rather than enhancing it. While clear, the line-level craft lacks the concision and propulsion expected of top-tier work, occasionally leaning on stock imagery and sentimental phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it's hampered by a tendency toward overwriting. The high density of figurative language and abstract emotional descriptors ("luminescent ache," "glowing sorrow") in nearly every paragraph creates a uniform texture that can feel sluggish. This lexical density, while tonally consistent, occasionally sacrifices momentum and clarity for poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it occasionally tips into conceptual abstraction that tells more than it shows, as in "the interrupted cadence now a personal torment, pulling her between past sketches and future voids." A few phrases feel slightly overwritten, with high density that slightly impedes momentum. The craft is strong, but a final polish for concision would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong verbs. While the figurative language is consistently beautiful, its sheer density at the beginning slightly slows the initial momentum. A few phrases ("callused yet gentle," "drooping as if in quiet mourning") lean towards familiar genre conventions, but the overall craft is very strong, with no significant loops or syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density. However, there is a noticeable prose artifact in the repetition of "sapphire" ("sapphire hush," "sapphire threads," "sapphire hues"). While it establishes a strong tone, the frequency slightly overwrites the effect, making it a stylistic tic that could be refined for greater impact. This minor loop prevents a higher score but does not obscure clarity or harm the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is elegant and often evocative, with strong imagery ("glistened like emeralds," "green threads weaving through her blood"). However, there are minor instances of conceptual redundancy and academic diction ("catalyze hidden metamorphoses") that feel slightly out of place in the otherwise grounded, sensory narrative. While free of significant artifacts, these small slips in register prevent the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently strong, with evocative imagery and a controlled rhythm. Word choice is precise and effective ("ceaseless canvas," "haggard awe"). There is a minor tendency in the opening paragraph to stack metaphors ("threshing meaning," "deeper harvest," "sifting through the chaff"), which creates a slight density drag, but the voice is strong enough to carry it. The clarity and propulsion are otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with evocative descriptions and varied sentence structures that create a compelling rhythm. The momentum is solid throughout. The score is held back by a noticeable text artifact: the awkward phrase "steadily unpredictable" is repeated three times, which feels forced and unnatural, breaking the otherwise immersive quality of the narration. This repetition reads like an intrusive element rather than a deliberate stylistic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often elegant, with strong imagery and rhythm ("hummed with potential, like the pause before a note"). However, the momentum is occasionally slowed by abstract language and lexical repetition. Phrases like "compile these fragments," "navigated absences," and "staggered intervals" feel like scaffolding from a prompt, creating a slight conceptual loop that detracts from the otherwise immersive line-level craft. This conceptual redundancy prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from overwriting and repetition. Phrases like "symphonies of ink" and "analytically artistic renderings" feel dense, and the repeated "trembling certainty" is a significant prose loop that dulls momentum. While many sentences are well-crafted, these artifacts prevent the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of polish.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with a strong rhythmic quality. However, there is a recurring reliance on key phrases ("unheard symphony," "entangled memories," "forgotten patterns") that, while thematic, feels slightly heavy-handed and borders on a stylistic loop. The final paragraph's declarative, summative sentences also slightly reduce the momentum built previously.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong imagery. However, it suffers from a high density of figurative language and conceptual nouns that can feel overwritten in key moments, slightly impeding momentum. The repetition of "hushed thunder" and "spatial mutiny" functions as a motif but borders on becoming a lexical crutch. While there are no egregious errors, a tighter rein on the lyrical density would increase the story's propulsion and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often elegant, with strong verbs and purposeful sentence structure. However, there is a noticeable repetition of key thematic phrases—"deathly vitality," "waiting actively," "breach"—that feels slightly over-determined. While intentional, this recurrence borders on a prose artifact, calling attention to its own construction and slightly diminishing the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious and often beautiful, but it verges on overwriting. The high density of figurative language and the constant repetition of key thematic words ("gilded," "refract," "incandescent," "restraint") feel self-conscious at times. Lines like "he would refract the past this way" function more as direct thematic statements than dramatized prose, slightly flattening the story's immersive quality.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exceptional, with high information density and a distinct, poetic rhythm that never feels forced. Figurative language is both original and thematically coherent, such as memories having "grit and warmth" or forming a "growing tapestry." There is zero scaffolding, redundancy, or overwritten passages; every sentence serves to advance the story's accumulative purpose with clarity and grace. The final line provides perfect, resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often evocative and polished, but it is significantly hampered by repetitive phrasing that dulls its impact. The frequent reuse of "reimagined," "retelling," and "retold" in the story's second half creates a noticeable and mechanical loop. Similarly, the key phrase "gloomy cheer" is used three times, making it feel like a label rather than an emergent feeling, which is a notable prose artifact in a piece of this length.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is often lyrical and inventive, but it occasionally slips into abstraction and conceptual summary where concrete action would be stronger (e.g., "Lira's absorption of shocks peaked"). There is a slight overuse of key abstract nouns like "desperation," "intuition," and "allegiance," which creates a minor repetitive loop. Despite this, the sentence-level craft is generally clear and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is consistently elegant, precise, and highly evocative, contributing significantly to the story's atmosphere and emotional depth. Sentences are varied, active, and dense with information, propelling the narrative forward without wasted words. There are no significant loops, scaffold, or figurative muddles, maintaining clarity even amidst lyrical descriptions, culminating in a strong, clean closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose demonstrates strong rhythm and imagery, but it is hampered by line-level artifacts. The word "heartfelt" is used three times, creating a repetitive loop that dulls its impact. Some figurative language, like "moths to a gentle flame," relies on cliché. These instances of overwriting and scaffolding prevent the otherwise polished prose from achieving true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often evocative, the prose is hampered by noticeable line-level artifacts that prevent it from reaching the top tier. The story leans heavily on repeating key phrases—"singular convergence," "worrying tranquility," "subtly confident"—which dulls their impact and reads like a stylistic crutch. These repetitions, particularly in the final third, create a loop-like quality that detracts from an otherwise strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and imagistic, with high information density in many lines. However, a tendency toward repetition and near-redundancy slightly dulls its momentum. Key phrases like "wild hush" are used as a powerful motif but are frequent enough to border on a loop, and several sentences in the opening restate the town's decline in similar terms, creating minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but frequently tips into being overwritten. High-pressure moments are laden with stacked adjectives and similes ("coral-veiled columns rose like silent sentinels"), which can slow momentum. There are also minor instances of paraphrase loops ("not sound, but its profound absence, a silence that pooled...") that reduce the overall concision.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, poetic, and highly controlled. The deliberate repetition of key words—hush, repose, hover, thread, lattice—functions as a powerful, incantatory motif that builds the story's accumulative power, not as a flaw. Sentence structure is varied and rhythmic, propelling the narrative with a stately pace that matches the tone. There are no wasted words or text artifacts; every line contributes to the whole.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often evocative, but it is marred by the repetitive use of key prompt phrases ("mournful elation," "lovingly venomous," "resonant awakenings"). This creates a scaffold-like effect that feels artificial and repetitive, a notable flaw that prevents the otherwise strong prose from reaching the highest tier of craftsmanship.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from an extremely high density of figurative language that verges on overwriting. Furthermore, key phrases like "orchid solace" and "hauntingly optimistic" are repeated to the point of becoming prose artifacts, functioning as labels that slightly dull the final beats. These repetitive loops prevent the piece from achieving the concision and momentum required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is often evocative, but it's hampered by a significant text artifact: the repetitive use of key phrases from the prompt ("cautious enchantment," "warmly curious," "purposeful wandering," "interrupted journeys"). This template-cadence creates a mechanical feel that undermines the otherwise strong writing, reading less like organic prose and more like a fulfillment of a checklist. Removing this scaffold would significantly elevate the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often luminous, with strong verbs and evocative sensory details. However, it is held back by moments of conceptual redundancy and tautology, where adjacent phrases restate the same idea (e.g., "discover meaning in the margins, those overlooked spaces"). This tendency to over-explain slightly pads the narrative and softens the otherwise sharp line-level execution, preventing the prose from achieving flawless momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is consistently elegant and precise, with rich, specific imagery that avoids generic description. Information density is high, and the rhythm and syntax propel the narrative forward without loops or scaffolding. There are no figurative muddles; similes and metaphors are fresh and integrated, enhancing both setting and character.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the prose is often beautiful, it suffers from a relentless density of figurative language that borders on overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile, which can clutter the narrative and blunt the impact of more crucial images. This high density, while stylistically coherent, sacrifices the precision and momentum that more selective imagery would provide.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from overwriting, particularly a reliance on recurring compound adjectives ("lotus-hearted," "shrewdly innocent") that become prose tics rather than evolving motifs. This repetition, appearing in the first and second halves of the story, creates a loop that slightly dulls the narrative's momentum and emotional precision. While many lines are beautifully crafted, this density of similar figurative language feels strenuous in a piece of this length.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is often evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, the final paragraph is a severe text artifact. The meta-commentary ("Actual count calibrated to 712 words...") is scaffolding left in the final product, which completely halts momentum and breaks immersion. This is a critical failure in line-level craft, overriding the strengths of the preceding prose and preventing the story from being publishable as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often beautiful and evocative, but it is marred by conspicuous repetition of keywords from the prompt, particularly "methodically," "playful," "bewitch," and "nested." This template-like cadence creates prose artifacts that feel inorganic, as in "methodically playful precision" followed by "playful as a child" and "playful methodical nature." While the sentence-level craft is otherwise strong, this looping effect slightly dulls the momentum and feels like authorial scaffolding rather than pure voice.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is vivid and often lyrical, but it is significantly weakened by prominent loops. The phrase "converging chaos" appears three times, and "candidly cryptic" appears four times; this repetition functions as a scaffold that dulls momentum and reduces information density. While individual sentences are well-constructed, these recurring artifacts prevent the piece from achieving line-level excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often beautiful, the prose is significantly weakened by the mechanical repetition of key phrases ("reef-shadow joy," "shyly unstoppable," "off-key wind," etc.). This recurring scaffold creates a template-like cadence that feels inorganic and heavy-handed, constituting a major text artifact. This flaw prevents an otherwise strong piece from reaching publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with high information density. However, it occasionally verges on being overwritten, with figurative language so consistently dense that it can slightly impede momentum. Phrases like "veined with regret like the toxic blush of foxglove petals" are strong, but the sheer accumulation of such rich imagery borders on excessive, creating a texture that is almost too lush.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose contains some lovely imagery but is hampered by significant artifacts. There is notable repetition of key words and phrases ("unsnarl," "cautious exuberance," "carefully reckless") that feels heavy-handed. Several passages are overwritten, with stacked modifiers and figurative language that dulls momentum rather than sharpens the image, particularly the description of the archive in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose demonstrates ambition and rhythmic control, but is hampered by a tendency towards overwriting. Figurative language is deployed in nearly every sentence, and this density occasionally slows momentum and feels decorative ("stirred dust motes like forgotten memories"). While many phrases are individually striking, their cumulative effect creates a prose surface that is slightly too polished and self-conscious, sacrificing some immediacy for literary effect.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often evocative and polished, but it is held back by a tendency toward overwriting and a few familiar phrasings ("unraveling...like a frayed thread"). The "blooming" and "withering" motif, while thematically consistent, becomes repetitive and heavy-handed. These line-level issues, though minor, slightly dull the otherwise sharp craft and prevent the prose from achieving flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious but flawed by noticeable repetition. Phrases like "featherly determined" and "fractured hush" are used twice, functioning as authorial tics rather than earned refrains. Some sentences are overwritten, with figurative language that feels more decorative than functional. These artifacts, while not obscuring causality, slightly dull the momentum and create a sense of artificiality that works against the story's organic feel.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often evocative and strong, with a consistent rhythm. However, it is held back by patches of overwriting and a conspicuous paraphrase loop ("softly ingenious mind," "softly ingenious") that slightly dulls its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from overwriting, with a high density of similes and metaphors that can blur together and dull momentum. There are several instances of repetitive phrasing, such as the repeated use of "cheerful gloom" and "before memory fades," which feel like scaffolding. The final paragraphs shift from showing to telling, summarizing the thematic takeaway in prose that lacks the concision and propulsion of a truly top-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    While grammatically clean, the prose suffers from distinct paraphrase loops and repetitive phrasing. Core ideas ("serenade monotony," "ordering randomness") are restated multiple times in slightly different ways, creating redundancy that slows momentum. This synonym churn and conceptual repetition is a notable artifact that prevents the line-level craft from achieving true concision and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from overwriting and repetition that dulls its impact. Key phrases like "obsidian grace" are reused, becoming a tic rather than a resonant motif. The density of figurative language is relentless, occasionally blurring clarity and momentum. The sentence "Spontaneously anchored still, she circled the pond..." feels particularly redundant, restating an attribute that was established just moments before.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, it suffers from moments of overwriting and conceptual density, particularly with high-register coinages like "noctilucent reckonings." Some sentences become laden with abstract nouns ("luminous worth," "quiet beauty," "clear complexity"), telling the reader the emotional takeaway rather than letting the concrete images do the work. This tendency toward abstraction slightly dulls the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often evocative and precise, with strong sensory details and a controlled rhythm. However, its elegance is periodically marred by abstract, scaffold-like phrasing that echoes prompt language (e.g., "bridge the chasm between survivors and the untouched," "turning private agony into a universal language of empathy"). This register drift detracts from the otherwise immersive quality of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is often evocative, but it is severely hampered by text artifacts. The verbatim repetition of phrases like "lucidly watchful" (3 times) and "serene upheaval" (4 times) constitutes a significant scaffolding issue that breaks immersion and dulls momentum. This pattern of looped phrasing suggests a mechanical constraint rather than organic expression, fundamentally compromising its publishability at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmically strong, but it is marred by a noticeable repetition. The phrase "sensitively perceptive" appears three times, functioning as a scaffold that slightly undermines the "show, don't tell" principle for a core character trait. This loop, while not catastrophic, is a clear artifact that prevents the prose from reaching the highest tier of flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with vivid, rhythmic, and sensorially rich prose. The piece's primary flaw is a tendency towards overwriting; the density of figurative language is so high that it occasionally slows momentum. Repetition of key mood words ("harmony," "grace," "dusky") acts as a minor scaffold that could be tightened for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and often evocative, but it occasionally leans on abstractions ("endless tapestry of conflict," "unyielding motivation") and overwriting that slightly dulls its momentum. While there are no egregious errors, the piece lacks the consistent information density and concision of truly exceptional line-level craft. Some phrasing feels pre-packaged for effect rather than emerging from the specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—dense, evocative, and surgically precise. Figurative language, such as the "sky bruised with gathering clouds" and the salt flat yielding like "fragile bone," is fresh and thematically coherent. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere, demonstrating superior line-level craft and a powerful command of rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from overwriting. The density of figurative language ("fingers delicate as sonnets," "limbs flowing like stanzas") is excessive in high-pressure moments, slowing momentum. Minor repetitions of key phrases like "bodily poetic" also mark it for editorial tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    While ambitious, the prose suffers from a persistent overwriting that dulls momentum. Figurative language is stacked too densely, as in the opening line's "meteor hush...profound, starlit silence that swallowed echoes like distant thunder." The repetition of key phrases like "half-lit epiphanies" and "uncommonly serene" feels like a scaffold, and the overall effect is one of stylistic strain rather than effortless artistry.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story is significantly marred by conspicuous prose artifacts. Key phrases—"esoteric realist," "transiently rooted," "blushing stillness," "interrupted cadence," and "overlooked histories"—are repeated multiple times, creating a mechanical, scaffold-like effect. This repetition severely undermines the prose's organic quality and dulls the momentum, reading like a checklist of required elements.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is marred by line-level artifacts that would require an editorial pass. There are noticeable paraphrase loops, such as the repeated emphasis on the "technically gentle" nature of her work. The key phrase "snowmelt ardor" is also reused, slightly dulling its impact and creating a sense of overwriting that impedes momentum in an otherwise strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is vivid and often lyrical, but it is hampered by minor but noticeable artifacts. There are several paraphrase loops and keyword repetitions, such as describing both shadows and engravings as "playful" in their precision. These instances of overwriting slightly dull the momentum and prevent the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of seamlessness and efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but severely hampered by conspicuous repetition and scaffold-like phrasing. Phrases like "empirically ironic," "encrypted devotion," "dusky harmony," and "schematic representations" are looped multiple times, which dulls momentum and breaks immersion. This artifact-heavy execution obscures the otherwise evocative imagery and prevents the line-level craft from reaching a professional standard.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it leans on abstract nouns and conceptual labels ("cunning empathy," "silent resonance") where concrete imagery would be stronger. There are instances of scaffolding, such as the explanation of "shifting grace," which momentarily halt momentum. The line-level craft is generally clean but lacks the consistent propulsion and information density required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is often vivid, it suffers from a tendency toward abstraction and labeling at key moments (e.g., "The motivation burned in his chest," "his firmly grounded nature anchored him"). These moments of telling disrupt the otherwise immersive, sensory experience. Some sentences also verge on paraphrase loops, slightly reducing the line-level propulsion expected for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and frequently beautiful, but its high density of figurative language verges on being overwritten, slightly impeding momentum. The repetition of certain keywords, such as "feisty" and "persisted," functions more as a label than an organic part of the narrative texture. This prevents the line-level craft from feeling truly effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, but it is significantly flawed by scaffold-like repetition. The recurrence of phrases like "simply complicated" and "brightened disquiet" reads as an authorial tic or prompt adherence, creating verbal loops that stall momentum. While many individual sentences are well-crafted, these patterned artifacts pervade the text and prevent the prose from achieving the clean, propulsive quality required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and demonstrates a strong command of language, but it frequently borders on being overwritten. An extremely high density of figurative language, particularly the recurring musical metaphors ("muted violins," "chords resolving"), risks dulling the impact through repetition. Furthermore, the significant expository block at the beginning slows momentum, sacrificing propulsion for world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are well-crafted, propelling the narrative with a confident rhythm. The only minor friction comes from the integration of the abstract prompt concepts like "unkindled solace," which, despite strong efforts to embody them, occasionally read as thematic labels rather than emerging wholly from sensory detail, slightly thinning the texture in those specific moments.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose demonstrates high information density and clear propulsion, with selective, vivid sensory detail. Sentence structures vary naturally, and there are no significant instances of loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle to detract from clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong, evocative word choices. However, at key moments, particularly the climax, it verges on being overwritten with dense clusters of figurative language, such as "a spectral flower of quietude blooming from the stone's core, its petals of silence spreading outward." This slightly blunts the impact of the action, sacrificing momentum for description where concision would be more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and high-impact, marked by strong verbs and evocative imagery ("skeletal landscapes," "frost-etched rails"). The rhythm is controlled and sentences are dense with meaning, particularly in the first half. There is a minor loss of sharpness in the final two sentences, which lean on a more conventional turn of phrase, but the line-level craft throughout the core narrative is precise and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    While many individual sentences are beautifully crafted, the prose is severely hampered by text artifacts. There are prominent loops of key phrases ("deepening hush" appears 5 times, "preemptively nostalgic" 4 times, "conjecture" 6 times), which feel like prompt adherence rather than deliberate stylistic choice. This repetition dulls momentum and creates a template-like cadence that undermines the otherwise elegant line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is consistently elevated and evocative, with strong rhythm and rich sensory detail. Sentences are well-crafted, and the overall effect is immersive. However, there are minor instances of overwriting where the figurative language becomes slightly dense, such as "playfully wrestling the void into submission, seriously bent on crafting defiance," which feels more like authorial summary than character thought. These moments are infrequent and do not harm the closure, but they slightly reduce the line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong sensory details. Sentences like "certainty dissolved like salt in the tide" are precise and powerful. However, there are minor instances of telling over showing ("her motivation clear," "This indirect method allowed her to foresee") and a slight tendency towards overwritten phrases that could be sharpened. The primary flaw remains the final line of dialogue, which reads more like authorial summary than character speech.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and often stunning, with memorable phrases like "tendrils of hush." However, a few moments of overwriting and conceptual looping slightly mar the finish. The repetition of the abstract phrase "intangibly tangible" and the slightly awkward construction "gravity's inversion stretched to its contracted end" are minor but notable artifacts in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative but shows signs of overwriting and repetition. The key phrase "vaulting hush" is used three times, diminishing its impact and feeling like a prose artifact. There is a template-cadence tendency ("drifting prism terrace," "mournful keen," "fluidly logical") that, while establishing tone, also slightly dulls sentence-level propulsion and creates minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally lush and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, it is held back by occasional overwriting and moments of syntactic awkwardness ("Wisely adventurous," "the future's gleam sharpening her ache for what was"). The most significant flaw, the meta-commentary on word count, is a line-level disaster that disrupts narrative flow, though the primary penalty is applied to Voice (Q6) where the damage is greatest. Without those intrusions, the score would be considerably higher.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a high density of figurative language that can feel overwrought. There is some conceptual redundancy and synonym churn around key ideas (e.g., "threshold," "liminal space," "boundaries dissolve"). The final line's aphoristic neatness clashes with the preceding lyrical density, reading as a prose artifact that slightly mars an otherwise strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, vivid, and generally propulsive, with strong sensory details that bring the unique setting to life. Information density is high, particularly in descriptions of the farm and the final transformation. The primary weakness is the stylistic tic of repeating key conceptual phrases, which functions as a minor prose artifact that slightly dulls the momentum in a few places.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that can clutter rather than clarify ("its brass horn curved like a forgotten trumpet of fate"). There are instances of paraphrase-loops where adjacent phrases restate the same idea with different words, slowing momentum. The craft is clearly skilled, but lacks the concision and restraint needed for the highest tier of literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    This is the story's weakest category due to noticeable prose artifacts. The repeated use of key phrases ("shivering bliss" appears four times) creates distracting loops rather than rhythmic propulsion. While many sentences are evocative, there is a tendency towards overwriting, with dense modifiers sometimes slowing the momentum where concision was needed, particularly around the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is often evocative, it suffers from a consistent density that verges on overwriting, with stacked figurative language that can dull momentum. The final sentence—"as if the archives themselves exhaled in gratitude"—is a significant misstep into sentimentality, weakening an otherwise grounded ending. This flourish undermines the story’s quiet emotional realism at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is frequently overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that slows momentum ("dusk bled into the velvet sky," "loosened like frayed wire"). There are several instances of text-artifact loops, where thematic concepts like "tyranny of indifference" or "coded freedom" are repeated almost verbatim, reading more like thematic signposting than organic prose. This stylistic tic significantly weighs down the narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is hampered by moments of overwriting and minor inelegance. Redundant phrasing, such as "melody built quietly vivid, each phrase vivid in restraint," constitutes a noticeable prose loop. While the overall effect is strong, these line-level artifacts prevent the story from achieving the flawless execution required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often beautiful, with strong imagery. However, it suffers from minor but noticeable repetition. The triple use of "mossy delight" and the direct echo of "emerged transformed always" function as paraphrase loops that slightly dull the momentum. While the figurative language is dense, it mostly avoids becoming overwrought and serves the story's magical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery ("edges curling like smoke," "mist rising like ghosts"). However, it is held back from excellence by a few minor but noticeable artifacts. The phrase "uncertainly certain" becomes a conceptual loop, and the use of a stock phrase like "heart raced" at a key moment slightly dulls the immediacy. These elements prevent the line-level craft from being flawless, particularly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and imagery. However, it occasionally slips into overwriting and relies on repeating key abstract phrases, such as "luminous regret," which slightly diminishes their impact. The compound construction "factually mystical" is awkward and used twice, reading like a conceptual label rather than organic prose. These minor but noticeable artifacts prevent the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of polish.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often effective, but it occasionally tips into being overwritten, with a high density of adjectives and figurative language that can feel slightly generic to the fantasy genre ("jagged walls," "timid rays"). While the rhythm is generally strong, some sentences are burdened by stacked descriptors. The repetition of "luminous ache" works as a motif, but the overall effect is a prose that values texture slightly over concision, which dulls the impact of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and dense with strong, specific imagery ("jagged pulses," "roots twisting through unfamiliar soil"). The rhythm and syntax support the story's grim, introspective tone effectively. While the high density of figurative language and conceptual phrasing ("displaced rootedness," "mathematics of mercy") occasionally borders on being overwritten, it remains consistent with the character's intellectual and analytical nature, ultimately serving the story's voice more than it detracts from momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a recurring artifact: the repetition of key abstract phrases ("elusively tangible," "eternal instant," "anchors of intuition"). This synonym-looping for core concepts creates a sense of scaffolding that slightly dulls the momentum and information density. While the rhythm is controlled, this pattern prevents the line-level craft from feeling entirely organic.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=1.5)
    The prose is clean in places but is ultimately destroyed by the presence of scaffolding and authorial notes. Phrases like "adjusting for count" are not part of the narrative; they are process artifacts left in the final text. This represents a fundamental failure of line-level craft, making a professional reading of the story impossible.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious, often achieving a beautiful, resonant quality. However, it is weakened by a recurring pattern of paraphrase loops, where a concept is stated and then immediately restated in slightly different terms (e.g., "rustling awakenings, those subtle stirrings"). This tic of authorial scaffolding slightly dulls the momentum and information density, preventing an otherwise strong piece of prose from reaching the highest tier of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is significantly hampered by overwriting and repetition. Key phrases like "burnished sorrow," "devise," and "reimagine" are overused to the point of becoming prose artifacts that dull their impact. This lexical looping, combined with a relentless figurative density, makes the writing feel labored and less impactful than its individual sentences might suggest.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is consistently elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, at the story's absolute peak—the moment Elias overcomes his doubt—the language momentarily shifts from embodied action to a more abstract summary ("He banished the shadows of uncertainty with a deeper truth"). This brief instance of telling, rather than showing, is a small but noticeable flaw in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it is hampered by several artifacts. The description of the psychometry reading ("A hinged awakening began, the first pivot swinging open...") feels mechanical and overwrought. There's also a recurring use of key phrases ("resonant hush," "sensibly eccentric") that feels like scaffold rather than organic description, slightly dulling the momentum at critical points.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is undermined by severe lexical looping and scaffold-like phrasing. Key terms from the prompt ("perpetually learning," "scaffold complexity," "reimagine") are repeated to the point of becoming intrusive artifacts. This repetition clogs momentum and makes the narrative feel formulaic and overwritten, particularly in moments that should be driven by fresh, specific language.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is stylistically rich and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there is a recurring reliance on certain key phrases—"umbral tenderness," "quietly driven," "dawning hush," "reckoned"—which function as a minor scaffold. While possibly intentional as a motif, the repetition slightly dulls the prose's momentum and gives it a templated feel in places, preventing it from reaching the highest tier of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is ambitious, with powerful, imagistic sentences like the description of the obsidian lagoon. However, it frequently slips into overwriting, with a high density of adjectives ("searing," "solemn," "unyielding") and a tendency toward synonym loops that can clog momentum. The primary failure is the final meta-narrative sentence, an artifact that breaks all rules of prose craft and brings the story to a jarring, amateurish halt.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    While grammatically clean, the prose suffers from repetitive phrasing and conceptual loops, especially around key terms like "working memory," "reimagined," and "false comfort." Several sentences function as scaffolding, stating intentions or themes directly rather than dramatizing them. The line, "Working memory, that mental forge where ideas clashed and reformed, became his method," is a prime example of telling that slows momentum and overwrites the action it describes.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lyrical and often beautiful, with high information density. However, there is a minor but noticeable prose artifact: the repetition of "velvet" three times ("velvet disquiet," "velvet unease," "velvet night"). While tonally consistent, this recurrence in such a short piece slightly dulls the otherwise sharp execution and stands as the primary reason the score is not higher.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is hampered by several line-level artifacts. There are noticeable redundancies, particularly in the repeated descriptions of the egg's hatching and its chaotic effect. Key phrases like “furiously tranquil” and “wild serenity” are reused, which slightly diminishes their impact. These loops and near-paraphrases create minor drags on momentum, preventing an otherwise strong piece from achieving true flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and precise for most of the story, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Momentum is well-managed through varied sentence structures. The score is lowered due to the final paragraph, which reads like an unnecessary summary and breaks from the "show, don't tell" principle established earlier, slightly flattening the prose at the very end. There is also a minor typo ("a array").

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but frequently overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that can blur meaning rather than sharpen it ("sentinel carved from stardust and silence," "primal bloom," "elegant repose"). There are several instances of conceptual loops where similar abstract ideas are restated in different poetic terms, which slows momentum and clutters the narrative with scaffolding instead of propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose contains striking images, particularly in its depiction of the wasteland, it is significantly hampered by line-level artifacts. The persistent recycling of a small cluster of thematic keywords creates a looping effect that dulls momentum and reduces information density. Phrases like "preserve the weight of those unspoken words" feel like boilerplate, and their repetition detracts from the otherwise elegant craft.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with a strong, varied rhythm. However, it occasionally tips into being overwrought, with a high density of figurative language that can feel slightly strained ("sand turned to silk"). Certain phrases are clunky ("or what felt like decades in this warped timeframe"), and the piece would benefit from a pass to trim abstract descriptors and sharpen the most critical images to ensure they land with maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but it is marred by prominent repetition artifacts that read as a stylistic crutch. Key phrases like "burnished hush," "warmly attentive," and "woven dawns" are repeated three times each in a very short text, creating a looped, template-like cadence that dulls the momentum and specificity of the otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it suffers from occasional thematic scaffolding and repetition. Phrases like "brazen calm" and "gently systematic" are used as labels multiple times, and some lines state the theme directly. This reduces the overall information density and momentum, telling the reader what to feel instead of letting the images do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lyrical and dense with imagery, demonstrating a high level of craft. Sentences are varied and propulsive. There are, however, minor instances of overwriting that slightly dull the precision, such as the redundant pairing of "artificial pilgrimage" with "constructed journey," or "luminous skeptic whose sharp mind glowed." These are small blemishes on an otherwise polished and confident execution.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is rich, dense, and rhythmic, demonstrating high-level craft. While the figurative language is pervasive, it remains purposeful and avoids obscuring meaning, serving the story's accumulative drive. The sentences are well-varied, propulsion is strong, and there are no discernible loops or scaffolding; every line contributes to atmosphere, character, or the advancement of the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose contains powerful, evocative imagery, but it is significantly marred by scaffolding and overwriting. Phrases like "Tinted revelations began to unfold" and "Tinted revelations sharpened" function as authorial headings, not integrated prose, which severely disrupts momentum and immersion. This structural artifact, combined with occasional purple phrasing ("auditory veil"), marks the story's most significant flaw at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, particularly in its descriptions of the station. However, there is a recurring syntactic pattern where abstract concepts are paired to describe a change in state (e.g., "bewilderment into a deliberate exploration," "disorientation into fuel for discovery," "confusion into exploration"). While effective once, this repetition creates a slight template-cadence feel that momentarily flattens the otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatically sound, with some evocative imagery. However, it suffers from several prose artifacts, including a high density of figurative language in peak moments and scaffold-like sentences that state themes directly ("Yet the tone of his path was cautious abandon..."). The repetition of certain thematic phrases borders on a loop, slightly dulling the narrative's forward momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and rhythmic, creating an incantatory momentum that serves the story's ritualistic plot. While the high density of figurative language ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence") is a deliberate stylistic choice that largely succeeds, it occasionally verges on being overwrought. A few phrases feel slightly redundant, such as the near-paraphrase of being "illuminated only by the absence of light" and "present in what was not there," which slightly tempers the otherwise masterful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is marred by occasional artifacts that betray a lack of polish. A key sentence contains a paraphrase loop ("visions substituted reality... supplanted the stark bookstore halls"), and another explicitly states the story's theme in scaffold-like language. While the overall craft is high, these lapses prevent the piece from achieving flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the prose is often evocative, it is significantly hampered by repetitive phrasing and lexical loops that create a mechanical, templated cadence. The word "winnow" is used four times to describe functionally similar sorting actions, and phrases like "fierce repose," "woven hush," and "fidgeted productively" recur like leitmotifs. This pattern-artifact measurably dulls momentum and undermines the story's otherwise strong craft.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.5)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from an unrelenting density of figurative language that borders on overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile ("sky bruised," "silence hammered," "ember" of motivation), which can exhaust the reader and flatten the rhythm. A more judicious use of imagery would allow the most powerful descriptions to land with greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative and dense, but its momentum is hampered by significant repetition of conceptual keywords. The word "quilting" appears seven times, and "dire enchantment" three times, functioning as a conceptual loop that reduces information density and freshness. While stylistic, this recurrence reads as a prose artifact, a template cadence that dulls the line-level craft, especially in such a short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it is hampered by a tendency towards overwriting. Sentences are frequently laden with multiple clauses and stacked modifiers, which sometimes slows momentum and clutters the imagery. While there are no egregious errors, a more concise and varied sentence structure would have given the powerful moments more room to breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but it is held back by a few recurring weaknesses. The metaphor of "screaming" is used three times ("screaming in its quiet fury," "heart screaming tenderness," "screaming its truth"), which dilutes its impact and feels like a tic. The final sentence functions as a thematic summary, a slight narrative scaffolding that tells the reader what was just demonstrated. These line-level issues, while minor, prevent the prose from achieving the flawless propulsion required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is consistently elegant and information-dense, with a strong, varied rhythm. Sentences like "Elias, pieced together from forgotten maps, salvaged radios, and memories of routes long abandoned" establish character and voice in a single stroke. There is a slight tendency toward a high lyrical register that brushes against overwriting, as in "doubt fluctuated in," which is a bit too explicit after the premise has been established. However, this is a minor flaw in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece with no significant artifacts or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted: dense with information, highly propulsive, and free of any loops, scaffold, or gratuitous embellishment. Figurative language is specific and evocative, enhancing atmosphere and theme without obscuring clarity, especially in the climactic moments. Sentence and paragraph rhythms vary naturally, supporting momentum without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is rich and evocative, with high information density and strong sensory detail. Sentences are crafted with a deliberate, sometimes complex rhythm that supports the story's contemplative mood. While a few phrases lean towards being overly literary ("clung like a lover's regret"), the overall craft is precise, clear, and free from significant artifacts or momentum-killing loops.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often evocative, but it is hampered by a significant repetitive artifact: the phrase "empirically intuitive" is used as a scaffold three times, telling the reader a trait instead of showing it through action. This loop, combined with occasional overwriting like "stalactites dripped like uncertain thoughts," slightly dulls the otherwise strong line-level craft and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it trends towards overwriting, with a high density of similes and figurative language that occasionally clutters the action ("whispering... like a veiled threat," "snagged... like insistent fingers," "flickered like tiny warnings"). While stylistically consistent, this reduces propulsion and concision, particularly in moments that would benefit from sharper, more direct prose.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is the story's critical failure. It is severely overwritten, with nearly every sentence weighed down by dense, abstract figurative language ("crimson determination bled into amber perseverance," "density of presence thicken"). This purple prose clogs momentum, obscures the emotional core, and reads as a performance of profundity rather than a clear-eyed rendering of a human moment.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative and polished, but its momentum is hampered by significant lexical looping. Key phrases—"jaded wonder" (4x), "feral" (3x), "soar" (5x), "distill" (3x)—are repeated to the point of becoming prose artifacts. While potentially intentional as a refrain, this repetition feels more like a scaffold, reducing the information density and creating a noticeable tic that detracts from an otherwise strong execution.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but it is significantly hampered by repetitive phrasing that feels like scaffolding. Key phrases from the prompt ("mapping the emotional terrain," "occluded views," "unveil ordinary miracles," "reading between the lines," "trembling calm") are used multiple times, creating a loop that dulls momentum and gives the piece an artificial, constrained quality. This repetition prevents the otherwise strong line-level craft from achieving true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, particularly in its opening and closing paragraphs. However, a few phrases contain a density of figurative language that momentarily slows momentum, such as the description of doubts crystallizing. The line "The runes crystallized not in pain, but in beauty" feels slightly too convenient, a decorative turn that could be sharpened to better reflect the gritty process of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it occasionally tips into being overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that can feel stacked. The repetition of key words like "grit" and "ethereal" borders on becoming a tic, and scaffold phrases like "advising through metaphor" are clunky, preventing the prose from achieving flawless momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious but is weakened by noticeable line-level artifacts. Paraphrase loops ("echoing softly in the hush, each footfall a resonant hush") and conceptual tautologies ("wanderingly exact, his path was a precise meander") appear more than once, slightly dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is meticulously crafted, with a strong, varied rhythm and high information density. There are no technical errors, loops, or scaffolding. However, the line-level craft is so consistently rich with figurative language and elevated diction that it occasionally feels overwritten for the story's grounded context, drawing attention to its own artistry at the expense of seamless immersion. The effect is beautiful but risks feeling self-conscious.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear and often evocative, with strong sensory details that build atmosphere effectively. However, it suffers from minor overwriting and repetition, most notably the recurring phrase "quiet wildfire" and a density of fire-related metaphors that feel slightly forced. While there are no major line-level errors, a tighter edit would enhance its propulsive force.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is elegant but has a tendency towards overwriting, with a high density of abstract concepts and figurative language that sometimes clutters rather than clarifies. There is a recurring conceptual loop around keywords ("lucid contradictions," "widen perspectives," "traverse") that feels programmatic. While individual sentences are well-crafted, this repetition slightly dulls the story's momentum and creates a templated feel.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and polished, with strong, rhythmic sentences and vivid imagery ("a frozen ripple on water," "a collective sigh from the world above"). While generally excellent, some phrasing like "melodically haunted attribute" or "deliberate ache of cultivated estrangement" pushes into a slightly overwrought, academic register that feels more like authorial summary than character-filtered perception. This is a minor issue in an otherwise beautifully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is often beautiful and dense with imagery, it suffers from significant structural repetition. Phrases like "The context began to change," "...context changed again," and "...context had changed once more" create a mechanical, template-like cadence. This scaffolding, along with repeated uses of "gently thorough" and "haunted euphoria," feels overwrought and detracts from the otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is frequently beautiful, with strong opening imagery and a confident rhythm. However, a few moments tip into overwriting, such as the simile "cracking like brittle ice to mask the void within," which feels like a stock phrase in an otherwise original piece. The repetition of "desperately" as a modifier, while purposeful, verges on becoming a tic, slightly diminishing the overall polish of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative but burdened by overwriting in places, with a high density of figurative language that sometimes feels stacked. There is a recurring conceptual vocabulary ("uncharted depths," "inner storms," "quiet blaze") that borders on cliché within the story's own context. This tendency towards abstraction slightly dulls the immediacy of key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and often elegant, with strong imagery. However, there is a recurring pattern of conceptual restatement, such as pairing "thresh meaning from the chaff" with "sift through life's scattered grains," which creates a slight redundancy. This tendency toward paraphrase-loops, while not pervasive, marginally reduces the prose's momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and maintains a strong, consistent rhythm. However, a few phrases rely on familiar constructions ("shimmered like a forgotten dream," "tugging at his heart") that slightly dull the otherwise sharp specificity. The line-level craft is strong, but these minor slips prevent it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose contains moments of evocative imagery and strong rhythm, but is significantly hampered by overwriting and repetition. The phrase "volcanic tenderness" becomes a prose artifact, a loop that dulls its own impact with each use. The high density of figurative language, while ambitious, often slows momentum and muddles clarity rather than sharpening it, particularly in moments of discovery that should feel immediate and sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it's hampered by significant conceptual looping. Key phrases—"auroral sorrow," "quietly rebellious," "hush of the universe inhaling"—are repeated to the point of becoming prose artifacts, dulling their initial impact. While potentially a stylistic choice, this repetition reads as a lack of lexical variety under pressure and prevents the otherwise strong line-level craft from achieving excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, clear, and generally avoids major artifacts like loops or scaffolding. The sentence structure has adequate variety and maintains momentum. There are moments of slightly overwrought phrasing ("calculated twist of spontaneity") that feel more like authorial labels than organic prose, but these are infrequent and do not obscure the story's propulsive clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is often beautiful and rhythmically controlled, with strong opening and closing images. However, it is held back by intermittent overwriting and awkward constructions like "spiralingly calm grace" and abstract placeholders such as "precarious timeframe." While the figurative language is mostly effective, a few lines veer into telling rather than showing, slightly dulling the immediacy of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, with strong rhythm and word choice. However, the density of figurative language—"cobalt library, where walls shimmered like deep ocean veins," "liminal twilight," "fractured light"—borders on being overwritten in places, slightly weighing down the momentum. While the effect is largely successful, a touch more restraint would elevate the craft further.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally strays into overwriting, with figurative language so dense it slightly obscures the action. The repetition of the key phrase "combative tenderness" feels like a minor crutch, and some constructions are overly abstract ("frothed like whispered secrets"). Despite this, the line-level craft remains very strong and clear through the pivotal closure scene.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with powerful imagery and a confident rhythm. Lines like "joys long desiccated" and "bruised purples" demonstrate high-level craft. There are, however, a few instances of thematic summary that slightly undercut the 'show, don't tell' principle, such as "she remade her sorrow into something bearable," which explains an effect the scene is already beautifully dramatizing.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a varied sentence structure that supports the story's momentum. However, it occasionally becomes overly dense with abstract nouns and conceptual phrasing ("the pursuit of beauty's elusive form," "a tremor of certainty...of the soul"). This tendency towards intellectual summary, while infrequent, momentarily pulls back from the otherwise immediate sensory experience, constituting a minor but noticeable overwriting artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious, with many striking and original phrases ("smoldering heart of the shattered city," "warped reflections into abstract poetry"). At times, however, the figurative language becomes overly dense, and abstractions like "revelations of deeper harmony" and "profound enlightenment to creation's joy" slightly dull the impact of the concrete imagery. The rhythm and sentence structure are generally well-controlled, maintaining a consistent, elevated tone.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a recurring structural template ("By questioning X, she propelled Y..."). This parallelism, while initially effective, becomes a noticeable scaffold that makes the narrative progression feel mechanical rather than organic. This artifact dulls the momentum at key transition points, creating a sense of pattern-filling that slightly undermines the otherwise strong craft.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, but occasionally tips into being overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that can feel heavy ("curtains of intention, ethereal veils woven from starlight and will"). Some phrasing is abstract where concrete imagery would be stronger. While there are no major technical flaws, a more restrained hand could have sharpened the impact of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong sensory details and varied sentence rhythms. Momentum is well-maintained through dense, purposeful lines. The only minor weakness is the slight repetition of key phrases ("steadily curious," "reverse engineering"), which, while thematic, creates a minor scaffold-like echo that could be refined for greater elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often lands with evocative force. However, it is marked by a significant prose artifact: the phrase "steadily unpredictable" is repeated three times, and "anguished joy" appears twice. This repetition, especially of a core paradoxical concept, reads like a tic rather than an intentional motif, dulling its impact and creating a looped feeling that detracts from the otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, but slightly marred by repetitive phrasing. The phrase "softly deliberate" is used three times, and "luminous regret" twice, creating a noticeable echo that feels like a prose artifact or template cadence. While the rhythm is otherwise strong, this repetition slightly dulls the momentum and prevents the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often evocative and clear, with strong imagery in the opening. However, it suffers from minor but noticeable artifacts, including paraphrase loops ("Reconstruction was the only path forward, a way to mend what was broken...") and a reliance on abstract nouns like "convictions," "illusions," and "dignity" in key moments where concrete action would be stronger. These abstractions slightly dull the propulsion in what is otherwise clean writing.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with high information density and evocative imagery. However, the figurative language is so consistently dense that it occasionally borders on overwriting, slightly weighing down the momentum in a few spots. While there are no major artifacts like loops, the sheer richness can be a minor hindrance, preventing the propulsion from feeling as effortless as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density. However, its figurative language is so consistently dense that it borders on being overwritten, slightly impeding momentum in places. The repetition of key words like "incubate" and "hushed thunder," while thematic, feels a touch heavy-handed on a line level.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is consistently elevated but suffers from overwriting. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, creating a density that becomes monotonous and blurs sensory detail rather than sharpening it. There are also minor paraphrase loops, such as describing her trapped creativity in two consecutive, similar metaphors ("barren for years," "caged bird"), which slows momentum. This relentless richness ultimately dulls the impact of pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is relentlessly dense with figurative language, which occasionally slows momentum and borders on overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile, a high-density pattern that can feel overwrought in a high-pressure scene. While rhythmically strong, a greater degree of concision and plain language would heighten the impact of the key images.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is imaginative but marred by recurring text artifacts, specifically paraphrase loops. For instance, "The hum of insight... resonated like a distant engine... It was a low vibration, felt more than heard, that sparked clarity..." restates the same idea multiple times, slowing momentum and overwriting the concept. While many images are striking, this tendency toward redundancy and conceptual summary prevents the line-level craft from reaching an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with evocative imagery and a controlled rhythm. The repetition of "Gently persistent" is a successful, deliberate motif that tracks Elara's transformation. However, the density of figurative language is consistently high, and in a few places, the prose feels slightly overwritten, with phrases that are beautiful but don't carry their weight in advancing the narrative moment, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most sentences. The rhythm is well-paced, mirroring Elias's solemn routine and his moment of startling discovery. The primary weakness is a slight tendency toward abstract nominalizations in moments of epiphany ("regeneration wasn't just of nerves, but of accepting silence's price"), which reads more like authorial summary than a character's raw thought. This momentarily flattens the otherwise superb line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language, such as the ink glistening "like a captured night," is evocative and purposeful. The sentences are rhythmically varied, and there are no discernible text artifacts, loops, or scaffolding. The craftsmanship is very strong, with only the occasional sentence structure feeling slightly more declared than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise for most of the story, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery. However, the final paragraph is a catastrophic text artifact, a piece of scaffolding left in the text that completely breaks immersion. While the story's core is beautifully written, this severe line-level failure at the very end is a major flaw that mars an otherwise polished piece and requires a substantial deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense, evocative, and meticulously crafted. Sentences like "the sun dipped low and painted the horizon in bruised purples" and "thunder muffled in silk" demonstrate extraordinary control of imagery and rhythm. The piece is devoid of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting; every word serves to advance character, atmosphere, or momentum with remarkable efficiency and elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean but consistently overwritten, especially in its use of figurative language ("fragile tapestry woven from ash and hope," "telepathic symphony"). This density of abstraction and metaphor often dulls the immediacy of the action rather than sharpens it, making the prose feel labored.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often lyrical, but it is hampered by recurring artifacts. The use of therapeutic jargon ("navigable terrain") and occasional abstract phrasing ("a tangible reminder amid the intangible grief") creates moments of conceptual summary that stall the otherwise strong momentum. These instances, while not pervasive, detract from the line-level immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious and often rhythmic, but it verges on being overwritten, with dense clusters of figurative language and abstract emotional descriptors that occasionally blunt precision. Phrases like "luminescent ache" work, but others like "callused from brushes and betrayal" feel slightly forced. The line-level craft is strong but would benefit from more restraint and concision.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, there are minor instances of overwriting and paraphrase loops that slightly dull momentum, such as the redundant phrasing around Elara’s "consciously wild" hair. These artifacts are not pervasive but prevent the piece from reaching the highest tier of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from several prose artifacts that dull its impact. There's a notable pattern of conceptual repetition and synonym churn (e.g., "bravely conflicted," "brave in her defiance," "conflicted brave"; "unspoken peril," "unspoken conversation"). The framing of the decision within a "blink" is used three times, which feels like a structural tic rather than an organic motif. These loops create a slight drag on an otherwise propulsive and evocative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is consistently elevated and often beautiful, with high information density. However, the patterned repetition of core thematic phrases ("tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet," "senselessly perceptive") acts as a prose artifact or conceptual loop. While stylistic, this recurrence slightly dulls the line-level propulsion by stating what has already been established atmospherically.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and highly figurative, creating a powerful, immersive atmosphere. While the density of metaphor verges on overwriting, it remains coherent and purposeful, serving the story's unique world-building rather than obscuring it. Sentence structure is varied, word choice is precise, and there are no discernible loops or scaffolding, resulting in a piece with high information density and strong forward momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and often elegant, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentence structure is varied, creating a controlled rhythm that supports the tense atmosphere. There are no significant loops or artifacts. The primary weakness is that the lines articulating the central "proof" in the climax carry the weight of the plot's logical failure; the prose itself is clear, but it is tasked with selling a conceptual impossibility, which it cannot fully overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and clarity. However, a few instances of stock phrasing (e.g., "unhealed wound," "swollen with secrets") slightly dull the otherwise sharp and original imagery. The piece avoids major artifacts like loops or scaffolding, maintaining momentum, but these minor clichés prevent it from achieving flawless execution at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmic, but its high figurative density occasionally verges on overwriting, with long strings of adjectives and metaphors. While individual lines are strong, the cumulative effect in some paragraphs slightly dampens momentum by prioritizing lush description over concision, particularly in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong, with evocative imagery and a controlled rhythm. The primary weakness is a subtle but persistent prose artifact: the looping of key thematic phrases ("warm coldness," "aberrant mercy," "gentle radical"). This conceptual repetition slightly dulls momentum and feels like thematic scaffolding rather than organic prose, preventing the piece from reaching a higher tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is consistently evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, with lush, sensory language. Information density is high, with most sentences serving character and atmosphere simultaneously. The primary flaw is a tendency toward high figurative density that occasionally verges on overwriting, and a few phrases like "despair clung to her like damp fog" feel less fresh than the surrounding text.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally clear and evocative, with strong verbs and concrete imagery. There are, however, moments where the density of figurative language feels excessive and slows momentum, such as the extended "willowglass hope" metaphor. The line explaining "somatic markers" is an expository hiccup that temporarily breaks the narrative flow, reading more like a summary than a character's thought.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong, with evocative imagery and a good sense of rhythm. However, there is a tendency toward adjective stacking and slightly overwritten descriptions that sometimes dull momentum rather than sharpen it. Certain phrases, like "factually mystical," are awkward and detract from the otherwise atmospheric prose. The line-level craft is competent and often beautiful but lacks the consistent precision and information density of truly flawless work.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in its descriptions ("a mosaic of minutiae"). There are minor instances of repetition that could be tightened, such as the multiple uses of "unravel" to describe the truth emerging. These are small blemishes on an otherwise polished and rhythmically controlled piece that demonstrates strong command of sentence-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often evocative and polished, with strong rhythm and imagery ("mist clung like forgotten whispers"). The score is held back by pockets of scaffolding and thematic summary that dull momentum. Phrases like "driven by a deep motivation to" or "the key to fixing what's broken" are less dense and overwrite what the action already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often evocative, the prose is significantly hampered by overwriting and repetition. Key phrases like "spindrift serenity," "ambient awareness," "percolate," and "distilled" are used so frequently they become a distracting scaffold, particularly in the final third where they are stacked together in a summary. This synonym churn and looping of core concepts dulls the momentum and clarity of the otherwise strong closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but its high density of figurative language sometimes verges on overwriting, slightly dulling the momentum. While free of major errors or loops, the sentences are so consistently stylized that the texture can feel overwrought, sacrificing some measure of clarity and impact for poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and rhythmic, with strong imagery and varied syntax. However, there are minor artifacts that prevent a higher score. The repetition of "quivering hush" across two sentences constitutes a small paraphrase loop that momentarily stalls momentum ("...drift in a quivering hush... That hush wrapped around her..."). Additionally, a few phrases like "unyielding urban air" and "quiet unraveling" feel slightly familiar, though they do not seriously detract from the overall quality.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and ambitious, marked by strong imagery and a varied sentence structure. However, there are minor instances of overwriting where dense, abstract descriptions—like that of the sundial mirroring "the very quanta of reality"—tell more than they show and slightly stall momentum. While free of major artifacts, these moments of lexical inflation prevent the line-level craft from being perfectly concise.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is luminous and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, a tendency toward lyrical density occasionally risks overwriting, particularly with abstract phrasing like "hummed with inevitably whimsical energy." While mostly elegant, these moments create a slight drag on momentum and prevent the prose from achieving flawless clarity, especially the repeated use of the phrase "whimsical inevitable."

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, dense, and rhythmic, demonstrating high-level craft. However, a few minor instances of overwriting slightly mar the execution, such as the somewhat cliché "mask of ethereal calm masking the gritty determination." While the line-level quality is overwhelmingly strong, these small slips prevent a perfect score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.5)
    While grammatically clean, the prose is burdened by significant overwriting and lexical repetition. Keywords such as "rebellion," "prudently adventurous," and "transfix" are looped to the point of becoming distracting artifacts that dull momentum and emotional impact. This lack of concision and variety prevents the line-level craft from reaching a professional standard.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is often elegant and atmospheric, but it is marred by significant repetition and conceptual looping that feels like a prose artifact. Key words like "lance," "hush," "methodical," and the thematic phrase "unifying opposites" are reused to the point of distraction, creating a templated cadence. This redundancy, particularly with the thematic language, flattens the otherwise strong line-level craft and gives the impression of scaffolding rather than organic expression.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often vivid and demonstrates strong command of imagery and rhythm. However, the story is marred by prominent text artifacts, specifically the verbatim repetition of "spongey dread" and "nervously confident." These loops dull momentum and read like scaffolding, a clear violation of line-level economy. This redundancy is the primary flaw preventing the otherwise strong prose from reaching a higher tier of polish.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often evocative, the prose suffers from overwriting and a tendency toward conceptual abstraction that weighs down momentum. Phrases like "pixelated as if etched by digital ghosts" and "its granular forgiveness absolving the nights" are dense but can feel more intellectual than sensory. Several key ideas, like "amnesty" and "forgiveness," are restated in different ways, creating paraphrase loops that reduce the impact of the core insight.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it is marred by significant repetition. Key phrases—"polished calm," "dusky harmony," "perceptively calm"—are used three times each, creating a template-cadence effect that dulls their impact. This looping functions as a prose artifact that, while not obscuring causality, measurably reduces the line-level craft and momentum of an otherwise well-written piece.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is clean and often beautiful, but it consistently verges on being overwritten with dense figurative language. Similes can be heavy-handed, such as comparing healing words to sutures closing wounds, which explains the metaphor rather than letting it resonate. This tendency towards ornate phrasing occasionally slows momentum and introduces a layer of abstraction where concrete detail would be more powerful, creating a slight barrier between the reader and the immediacy of Elara's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and highly figurative, creating a powerful, immersive atmosphere. Line-level craft is excellent, with varied sentence structures and strong verbs propelling the narrative. The density of similes ("like silent warriors," "like fallen stars," "like insistent foes") borders on overwriting in the opening but ultimately coheres with the story's mythic tone and does not obscure clarity during the pivotal climax.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious, with moments of beautiful imagery ("sky bled indigo"). However, it is marred by significant repetition and conceptual loops that function as prose artifacts. Phrases like "anxious elation," "purposefully curious," and "intersection of dreams" are reused multiple times, which dulls their impact and reads like authorial scaffolding rather than intentional, rhythmic prose, particularly impacting the story's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it is marred by the repetitive invocation of keywords from its premise (e.g., "inlaying meaning everywhere," "fiercely gentle," "dusky resolve" are each used multiple times). This repetition functions as a prose artifact, a form of conceptual loop that feels like scaffolding left in the text, slightly dulling the momentum and making the language feel less organic than it otherwise would.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and demonstrates high information density. Sentences effectively build the story's melancholic atmosphere through specific sensory details. A few phrases, like "hollow ache in his chest," lean slightly generic, but the overall craft is strong and avoids overwriting or momentum-dulling artifacts in the critical final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, but it occasionally suffers from overwriting and a reliance on abstract nouns ("forgotten wisdom," "spectral chase"). Certain complex sentences, laden with conceptual metaphors, become cumbersome and slow the momentum, such as the comparison of the seed to "a biological imprint of quantum leaps." The rhythm is strong, but clarity is sometimes sacrificed for lexical density.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous and highly polished, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft. Figurative language is dense but purposeful, consistently reinforcing the story's central themes and atmosphere, such as the smelts' scales being "metallic like his own gears" or "translucent as forgotten dreams." There are no wasted words or movements; every sentence contributes to the whole, resulting in a piece with remarkable information density and rhythmic propulsion. A rare example of ornate prose serving clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and specific sensory details. However, there are moments where it drifts into abstraction or incorporates prompt-like jargon ("core concept of latent radiance," "acquiring abandoned hopes") that feels less organic than the surrounding text. These instances create a slight textural inconsistency, momentarily pulling back from the otherwise grounded and poetic language.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it is marred by line-level artifacts that detract from its power. The verbatim repetition of "daringly methodical" is a significant flaw, feeling like authorial scaffolding left in the text. There is also a tendency towards overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that occasionally feels strenuous rather than sharp, slightly dulling the story's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and a reliance on stock metaphors ("ignited like a cautious flame," "dissolved like mist"). There are instances of telling over showing, with complex mechanics like "propagation delays" explained rather than experienced through the character's struggle. Several sentences are laden with abstract nouns that soften the story's immediacy and momentum, preventing the line-level craft from reaching an elite standard.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, its relentless density occasionally borders on overwriting, with figurative language packed into nearly every clause, slightly dulling momentum. A few abstract, conceptual phrases in the final paragraphs ("propagation of self") read more like scaffolding than lived-in prose, creating minor register drift at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rich and evocative, with high information density in its figurative language. While the style verges on baroque, it remains controlled and purposeful, creating a coherent and immersive texture. The sentence structure is varied, and the rhythm modulates effectively with the building tension. There are no notable loops or scaffolding artifacts; every sentence contributes to the story's radiant, hushed momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, but it is marred by a significant prose artifact. The repetition of the sentence stem "Kindly decisive, Elara..." creates a template-cadence that feels mechanical and breaks the otherwise organic flow of the writing. This pattern measurably dulls the prose at key moments of action and decision, preventing the piece from achieving true line-level excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. Imagery is precise and purposeful, especially in descriptions of the setting and key objects. The piece avoids major flaws like loops or scaffolding. A minor deduction is made for the inclusion of abstract psychological labels, which, while infrequent, momentarily disrupt the otherwise concrete and sensory texture of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmically controlled, with strong imagery like the "sycamore hush." A minor weakness is its tendency toward high-density abstraction and thematic repetition ("vanish," "withhold," "appear"). This creates a texture that is occasionally more dense than propulsive, bordering on overwritten in its conceptual focus.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, there are minor but noticeable artifacts, such as the exact repetition of the phrase "Historically reverent" and the close echo of "weathered resolve." While the high density of figurative language supports the tone, these small loops slightly mar an otherwise polished execution.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose contains striking images, but it is weakened by repetition and abstraction. Phrases like “lingering luminance” and the oxymoron “brilliant dimness” are used multiple times, diminishing their impact. Some sentences lean on abstract concepts ("a remnant of organic wonder, holding secrets of the unadorned divine") where more concrete sensory detail would have provided stronger propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often luminous and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, it suffers from several prose artifacts that dull its momentum. The phrase "wandered purposefully" is repeated three times, creating a template-cadence feel. Similarly, "meteor hush" and "luminous vows" are heavily relied upon. The final paragraph includes summary-like sentences that tell rather than show, functioning as scaffolding that should have been removed in a final polish.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often lyrical and precise, but it suffers from noticeable repetition. The phrase "quiet enthusiasm" appears four times and "stellar doubt" three times, functioning as scaffolding that diminishes in impact with each use. This lexical looping, particularly of the story's core emotional states, creates a slight drag on momentum and prevents the line-level craft from achieving true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is consistently elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The information density is high, with most sentences serving multiple functions. The score is moderated by a slight tendency towards overwriting, where the density of figurative language in some passages slightly thickens the prose, momentarily impeding its otherwise excellent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is frequently evocative and polished, but it is hampered by a notable text artifact: the repetitive use of the same few descriptors ("naive," "brittle," "lukewarm," "earnest"). This verbal tic creates a loop that slightly dulls the prose's momentum and acts as a narrative scaffold, repeatedly telling us about Elias's core traits instead of allowing them to be shown exclusively through his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose aims for a high literary standard but is significantly undermined by conspicuous repetition. Key phrases like "precisely humane" and "mirrored hush" are reused to the point of becoming distracting prose artifacts that break immersion. This looping, combined with some overwriting, dulls the narrative's momentum and gives the piece a mechanical feel, despite many otherwise strong sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious and often beautiful, but its relentless density of figurative language and adjectives occasionally verges on overwriting. Sentences are consistently long and lush, which, while establishing a strong atmosphere, can slightly dull the propulsion of key moments. The craft is strong, but a greater variation in sentence structure and a more sparing use of metaphor in high-pressure beats would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional craft, with high information density, clear propulsion, and varied sentence structure. There are no detectable loops, scaffold, or figurative muddles in peak beats. The language is precise and evocative, contributing significantly to the story's immersive quality and momentum.</question>
    <question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story presents a fresh take on the lone watcher trope through its unique setting, the specific nature of the threat (mimicking natural phenomena), and the profound emotional cost of vigilance. The "soundless echo" and the repurposed parachute buckle are ingenious, specific details that elevate the narrative beyond typical genre conventions.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often effective, but it falters at the climax with overwriting and cliché. Phrases like "neural pathways igniting like stars" and the summary-style list of emotions at the end weaken the impact of the most crucial moment. This reliance on familiar language and telling over showing dulls the sharpness of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant textual artifacts, primarily the verbatim repetition of key phrases ("storm-born silence," "notably receptive," "hush of a possibility just born"). This looping creates a scaffold-like feel, dulling momentum and giving the piece a mechanical rhythm rather than an organic one.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with evocative imagery and a confident rhythm. However, there are minor but noticeable artifacts that detract from a flawless execution. The repetition of key phrases ("mournful eagerness") feels like a tic, and some descriptive passages lean toward being slightly overwritten ("macerating their rigid fibers," "soaking dissolution"). The line that explicitly names the vines as "symbols" is the most significant flaw, momentarily breaking the immersive quality of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative, but its momentum is significantly hampered by repetitive phrasing. Key phrases like "Through the veil of sleep," "dimensionally homesick," and "foggy lucidity" are reused multiple times, creating a templated cadence that feels like scaffolding. While potentially aiming for a lyric effect, the repetition in such a short piece reads as a prose artifact that dulls the impact of otherwise strong sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, but it frequently tips into overwriting, with dense clusters of figurative language that can obscure rather than illuminate ("shadows that danced like preserved flowers in a glacial vase"). While the rhythm is generally strong, some sentences become overburdened with clauses, slightly impeding momentum in moments of high tension. There are no grammatical errors, but concision would heighten the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong control of rhythm and imagery, particularly in descriptions of the setting and the star fragment. Sentences are generally well-constructed and propel the narrative forward. There are isolated instances of overwriting where a phrase feels more writerly than authentic to the moment (e.g., "bridging earthly spectacle to stellar reality"), but these are minor and do not disrupt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but frequently overwritten, with dense clusters of figurative language and conceptual jargon ("permanent transient realm," "parallel folds of reality") that weigh down the narrative momentum. There is a reliance on stock phrasing ("heart pounding") and a tendency towards synonym-heavy descriptions. This lack of concision and clarity, especially during the crisis, obscures the action rather than sharpens it.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    While conceptually strong, the prose is marred by a significant line-level artifact: conspicuous repetition of key phrases. "Unsettling calm," "rational enchantment," and "realistically imaginary" are each used three or more times, creating a template cadence that feels mechanical and dulls the impact of otherwise evocative language. This flaw, particularly its presence in the closure beat ("unsettling calm of revelation"), is the single greatest barrier to immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is clear but severely hampered by conspicuous repetition and template-cadence artifacts. Phrases like "somber marvel," "balancedly curious," and "unfolded horizons" are reused to the point of becoming crutches. Sentence structures also loop, particularly around motivation and action ("Her motivation burned... Her motivation drove her..."; "The action to expand... The action expanded..."), which creates a mechanical rhythm and dulls momentum, feeling more like a scaffold being filled than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often lyrical and evocative, with strong imagery and a consistent rhythm that supports the story's tone. Lines like "shadows clung to marble columns like forgotten whispers" demonstrate high craft. However, the story occasionally relies on telling phrases ("Persistently curious by nature," "Her motivation was simple yet profound") where showing would be stronger. The final paragraph's shift to summary feels less polished than the preceding prose.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it occasionally slips into overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that can blunt momentum. There are minor instances of repetitive phrasing, particularly in the recurring descriptions of claustrophobia and "invisible things," which function as thematic labels rather than fresh observations. While grammatically clean, the sentence structures sometimes feel cumbersome, as in the opening line, which delays the subject and verb unnecessarily.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery, particularly in the description of the spilled ink. The rhythm and syntax support the story's quiet, determined momentum. A few phrases lean slightly toward abstraction ("vortices of regret, loops of lost opportunities") or cliché ("promise of revelation"), minor blemishes on an otherwise polished and confident piece of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific, original imagery ("towers of bone rose like forgotten spines against a bruised sky"). There is no wasted language; every sentence works to build atmosphere, character, or momentum. The rhythm and syntax vary to match the story's pacing, culminating in a climactic sequence that is both clear and powerful, free of any overwriting or logical artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density. However, it occasionally tips into being overwritten, with stacked modifiers that slightly dull momentum in peak beats. A few key phrases, such as "reshaping resentment into wry amusement," read as diagnostic summary rather than embodied experience, creating a prose artifact that momentarily flattens the otherwise evocative line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and generally polished, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there are minor repetitive artifacts that slightly dull its edge; phrases like "resonantly soft" and "in the gap between knowing and understanding" are used twice in a short text. While possibly intentional as refrains, they read more like slight scaffoldings that could have been varied for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "neon veins" and "brittle hush." However, a tendency toward abstract, slightly overwrought phrasing ("war's caprice," "reunion's spark," "thunderstorm's bottled fury") occasionally dilutes the concreteness of the action and edges toward literary cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from significant text-artifact patterns. The verbatim repetition of phrases like "misting hush," "whispering gleam," and "quietly persistent" creates a looped, template-like cadence that dulls momentum and feels artificial upon close reading. While attempting a lyrical effect, this repetition ultimately reads as a stylistic crutch that flattens syntactic variety, warranting a substantial deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, but it consistently borders on being overwritten, particularly in its dense accretion of conceptual adjectives ("quantum sonnets," "fractal haikus," "relativistic ballads"). While evocative, this density can overwhelm the sensory details and create a list-like effect. A few phrases, like "sanely eccentric heart racing," dip into cliché, slightly dulling an otherwise strong performance.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and ambitious, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. However, its primary flaw is a tendency toward overwriting; the density of figurative language is so high in nearly every sentence that it occasionally blunts the impact of individual images. This consistent elevation, while beautiful, creates a slight textural monotony that holds it back from the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is heavily burdened by the repetitive use of specific keywords (e.g., "disorient," "hush," "enveloped"), creating a looping, artificial quality that significantly hinders momentum and reads like mechanical prompt fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally strong, with evocative imagery and good rhythmic control. However, there are minor instances of repetition, such as "chronically curious nature" followed by "chronically curious mind" and the repeated use of "crisp, nostalgic" in the final paragraph. This repetition, particularly in the story's conclusion, reduces information density and slightly dulls the impact, triggering a deduction for artifacts touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it suffers from overwriting. The high density of figurative language in nearly every sentence ("danced like forgotten memories," "swing drifting lazily," "steam rising like whispers") can feel cluttered and lessens the impact of key images. While rhythmically pleasant, a greater degree of concision and restraint would sharpen the narrative's emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is often evocative, it is significantly weakened by repetition and keyword stuffing. Phrases like "radiant hush" and "upon the hush of budding hope," and words like "succor" and "insatiably creative," are reused to the point of becoming noticeable artifacts. This looping language dulls momentum and reduces the overall information density of the lines.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and evocative imagery. However, the story suffers from a distinct conceptual loop with the repetition of "lucid unrest," "lucid in its unrest," and "lucid turmoil." This recurrence of a key phrase, while thematically relevant, reads like a prose artifact that slightly dulls the impact through overuse instead of allowing the concept to be shown through different phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it frequently tips into overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that can feel decorative rather than propulsive. Several sentences restate the same emotional content in different terms, creating minor paraphrase loops. The line-level craft is strong but lacks the concision and restraint that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but suffers from overwriting and repetitive artifacts. Phrases like "driftingly alert" are used as a label-like loop, and the sentence structures can be overly dense, slowing momentum. This density and repetition, especially of key thematic phrases, measurably dulls the impact of an otherwise strong story, representing its most significant area for improvement.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is hampered by a few recurring artifacts. The floor-by-floor progression ("Floor three passed," "fourth floor," "fifth floor") creates a template cadence that feels mechanical and repetitive. Some phrasing is overwrought, and key concepts like "scattered light" are repeated to the point of diminishing returns. While generally clear, the density of figurative language occasionally clouds momentum rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but its strength is undermined by repetitive phrasing. Key terms like "dusty starlight," "spooled wholeness," and "quietly explosive" are used as refrains that begin to feel like thematic scaffolding rather than organic language. This lexical looping, while contributing to a lyrical tone, ultimately dulls the momentum and creates a sense of overwriting in an otherwise strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong rhythm and imagery. However, the repeated use of the story's key conceptual terms—"fractal," "fractally," "fractalize"—becomes a minor prose artifact. While central to the theme, the frequency of the word (8 times in ~700 words) slightly dulls its impact and creates a loop-like quality. The sentences are otherwise well-constructed, clear, and propulsive, but this conceptual repetition keeps the prose from achieving flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it is hampered by a recurring sentence structure, frequently opening with a participial phrase ("Flipping through...", "Seated cross-legged..."). This template cadence creates a rhythmic monotony that slightly dulls momentum. While generally concise, the piece also contains moments of mild overwriting and stock phrasing ("living inkblots," "familiar thrill") that could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is elegant and imagistic, but its relentless density of figurative language occasionally verges on being overwrought, slightly dulling its own impact. While many descriptions are stunning ("sun itself wept frozen tears"), the high concentration of poetic descriptors in nearly every sentence creates a uniform texture that lacks rhythmic variation. The repetition of key phrases like "driftwood nostalgia" borders on becoming a scaffold rather than an organic motif.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is often elegant and demonstrates rhythmic control, but it occasionally slips into overwriting. The repetition of key thematic phrases like "brambled hope" feels excessive and declarative. While technically clean, the line-level craft could achieve greater power through more concision and trust in imagery over direct emotional labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from high density and conceptual looping. Phrases like "bruised awe...twilight's bruise" and the constant recurrence of "hush," "flawed," and "ripple" create redundancy that slightly dulls the momentum. While stylistic, this repetition functions as a prose artifact that prevents the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of concision and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative and clear, with strong verbs and imagery. However, it is marked by a significant prose artifact: the thematic looping of the phrases "offhandedly exact" and "graceless beauty." This repetition, while thematically relevant, creates a noticeable scaffold that detracts from the line-level momentum and feels overly constructed.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, clear, and generally maintains good momentum. However, there are instances of overwriting with slightly stock metaphors ("taut string," "melody resolving into peace") that soften its impact. A paraphrase loop occurs where the motivation to "translate separation into connection" is articulated in narration and then repeated almost verbatim in dialogue, a redundancy that dulls a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the density of figurative language and abstract nouns is consistently high, occasionally risking overwriting that can obscure meaning rather than clarify it. Sentences like "The tone of the day carried an integrated fragmentation" state an atmospheric quality instead of creating it through concrete detail, slowing momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but it occasionally relies on explanation over dramatization, particularly when describing Elara's motivation and method ("Analyzing... was her method"). Some sentences become laden with clauses, slowing momentum. This tendency to summarize key internal processes prevents the prose from achieving flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, it is marred by a recurring prose artifact: the use of compound, abstract descriptors like "empathetically decisive," "vigorous tenderness," and "harmonious choral." This repetition creates a tell-not-show pattern that feels like authorial scaffolding, dulling the prose's impact and lending it a sentimental, overwritten quality in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious, often achieving beautiful and evocative imagery. However, it suffers from overwriting, with a relentless density of figurative language centered on a narrow palette of concepts (helix, spiral, fractal). This conceptual repetition ("helical loops," "helical redesign," "helical bursts") creates a prose artifact that slightly dulls momentum and reads as trying too hard for profundity on every line.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is the story's most significant weakness due to severe overwriting and repetition. Many sentences are burdened with adjective stacks and redundant phrasing ("This doodle was no idle scribble; it was the manuscript margin doodle"). Key terms from the prompt ("clandestinely luminous," "seeds of vigilance," "latent blaze") are repeated so frequently they lose impact and read like scaffold, which severely hinders momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong imagery ("stress cracks spiderwebbing its surface like forgotten sheet music"). However, there are minor but noticeable conceptual loops and redundancies. The phrases "symphonically minded" and "empathy in motion" are repeated almost verbatim, creating a slight scaffolding effect that briefly stalls momentum and feels less than perfectly concise.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lyrical and evocative, with high information density in most lines. However, its greatest strength—its figurative richness—occasionally borders on overwriting, with a density of metaphor that slightly impedes momentum in a few places. A line such as "Hopeful melancholy settled over him like the fading light" feels less fresh than the surrounding prose, and the climactic realization is delivered with a degree of summary that is less immediate than the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is the story's most significant weakness due to persistent overwriting. Nearly every noun is paired with an adjective, creating a dense, overwrought texture that slows momentum and can feel decorative rather than purposeful ("its brass filigree whispering of secrets sealed away from the world's clamor"). This stylistic tic, appearing in nearly every paragraph, smothers the story's emotional core under layers of description, dulling the impact of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there is a tendency toward high figurative density throughout, which occasionally verges on overwriting ("the tide turned its contemplative bend"). While the rhythm is generally controlled, the clarity of the final beat is slightly dulled by the thematic summary, a prose choice that prioritizes explanation over evocative action.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative and generally clear, particularly in its depiction of the unique environment. However, it is held back by occasional reliance on clichés ("motivation burned deep," "heart raced") and moments where it tells rather than shows, such as the "unveiling visions in her mind" which functions as an expository shortcut. These minor prose artifacts slightly dull the momentum at key points, preventing the craft from reaching the highest level of polish.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, especially in its descriptions of the setting. However, it occasionally relies on abstract conceptual phrases ("fog of happenstance," "singular convergence") where a more concrete rendering might have been stronger. While the rhythm and word choice are generally excellent, these moments of high-level summary slightly blunt the line-level immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful, with a strong, varied rhythm. However, the sheer density of figurative language, particularly in the peak climatic moments, verges on overwriting and slightly obscures the action beneath the description. Additionally, there is minor conceptual redundancy in the phrasing around the central act of liberation, which could be tightened for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.5)
    While ambitious and often beautiful, the prose suffers from overwriting. The recurring "avalanchingly quiet" motif, while effective initially, becomes a crutch that lessens its impact. The density of figurative language sometimes slows momentum and muddles clarity ("the avalanchingly quiet canyon absorbed it not with echo but with a deepening void"). It's a strong effort, but lacks the concision and restraint of truly flawless prose.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and largely beautiful, with striking imagery like "walls gleamed like frozen amber." The rhythm and syntax support the story's momentum, escalating effectively in the climax. A minor weakness is a single cliché simile ("burned like a half-extinguished flame"), a small imperfection in an otherwise stellar and highly polished execution that prevents a score in the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is ambitious but significantly overwrought and repetitive. Key thematic phrases ("germinate," "vibrating sympathetically," "coax wonder," "fade to myth") are reused to the point of becoming thematic labels, creating conceptual loops that stall momentum. This reliance on abstract nouns and repeated poeticisms obscures the concrete action and weighs down the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and varied sentence rhythms. The piece is penalized for the final paragraph, which reads like a drafting note left in the text. This prose artifact fundamentally disrupts the story's texture and momentum at the most critical point—the close.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density in its imagery. However, it suffers from patterned repetition of key phrases—"raveling silence," "stoically sparkling," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry"—which, while creating a thematic echo, function as prose artifacts under a strict editorial lens. This looping quality slightly dulls the momentum and prevents the line-level craft from achieving true flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is ambitious and contains striking images, but it is hampered by significant repetition and overwriting. Key words and phrases—"azure," "defiance," "deliberate," "barter," "rubble," "resilience"—are used to the point of becoming prose artifacts that dull momentum. Several sentences engage in synonym churn or paraphrase looping, such as describing his hammer strikes as both "deliberate and measured," which slows the pacing without adding new information.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, but it's hampered by a noticeable text artifact: the phrase "cyclically spontaneous" is repeated three times, creating a template-cadence loop that disrupts the otherwise poetic rhythm. This repetition feels mechanical and measurably dulls the line-level craft, especially for a story aiming for the highest tier of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong, rhythmic cadence. However, its density occasionally borders on being overwrought, with a recurring motif like "luminescent ache" used a bit too heavily. While the effect is powerful, a slightly lighter touch in a few key moments would elevate the craft from very strong to exceptional by allowing the images to breathe more.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, but is marred by minor but noticeable repetition that prevents it from achieving flawlessness. The phrase "shadowed elation" appears three times, feeling like a prose tic by its final use rather than a deepening motif. While the high density of figurative language is generally effective, it occasionally verges on being overwritten, slightly dulling the momentum of an otherwise powerful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is consistently elegant and imagistic. However, there is a recurring pattern of repeating key conceptual phrases ("iridescent caution," "quietly explosive," "magnetize stories") multiple times. While reinforcing the theme, this repetition functions as a form of scaffolding that slightly reduces momentum and information density, feeling more like a prompt adherence than organic expression.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is ambitious, with many striking and beautiful phrases. However, it frequently borders on overwriting, with a density of figurative language and elevated diction that can feel strained ("sorrows accruing like stellar parallax"). This tendency toward ornate phrasing, particularly in moments of high emotion or insight, creates a register that slightly clashes with the character's established role, representing a minor but persistent drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is highly polished, with a strong, varied rhythm and evocative word choice. The prose is dense with figurative language, which is a key part of its voice but at times risks feeling overwrought, slightly impeding momentum. However, the sentences are clear, purposeful, and free of significant technical flaws, successfully carrying the story's emotional and narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, with a sophisticated vocabulary and varied sentence structure that supports the tranquil, scholarly atmosphere. There are moments of overwriting with abstract concepts ("enlarged tranquility," "emotional fractures") that slightly distance the reader from embodied experience. Overall, the piece demonstrates strong line-level craft, avoiding major artifacts, but could achieve greater propulsion with more concrete imagery over abstract declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and sensory, with strong imagery like "colors leaching away like ink in rain." However, there are minor repetitive artifacts that dull its sharpness. The word "uncloak" is used twice in key moments ("uncloak the courtyard's hidden grace" and "uncloaking a promise of spring"), and "heuristically gentle" also repeats, making these moments feel slightly mechanical rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its relentless figurative density creates a uniform texture that lacks modulation. While mostly successful, this ornate style occasionally results in minor redundancies, such as a paraphrase loop near the beginning concerning oblivion. A touch more restraint and rhythmic variety would elevate it to a flawless level.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is often lyrical and effective, but the structure relies on the slightly mechanical repetition of "Her first false start... her next attempt... her third false start." The most significant flaw is the final block of text, which is not narrative prose but a generation artifact. This text artifact breaks momentum, clarity, and the basic contract with the reader, representing a critical failure in line-level craft at the story's most crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, it frequently tips into being overwritten, with a very high density of figurative language that can occasionally feel strained ("honeyed lightning," "veins held comet trails"). While mostly effective, a more judicious application of metaphor in high-pressure moments would have strengthened the line-level craft and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.8)
    While many individual sentences are evocative, the piece is severely hampered by prose artifacts, specifically paraphrase loops and repetitive thematic labels. The motivation "to uncork the suppressed creativity" is stated almost identically twice, a clear example of scaffolding that should have been removed. This redundancy clogs momentum and demonstrates a lack of concision, a critical flaw for publication at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong, clear verbs. Sentences are well-constructed with varied rhythms, avoiding repetition or scaffolding. While the figurative language is consistently strong, it occasionally borders on being overly dense, with nearly every paragraph containing a striking simile or metaphor. This is a minor issue of style, not a flaw in craft, and the overall execution is very clean.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. While the figurative language is ambitious and mostly successful, a few phrases slightly over-explain their function ("This glisten was no mere reflection; it was the sculpture's vital spark..."). These minor instances of telling what could be inferred prevent an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is often lyrical and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the final section contains a significant paraphrase loop ("wholeness felt fragmented still... wholeness pieced from fragments..."), which repeats the central thematic concept and dulls the closure. This redundancy, appearing at the most critical moment, constitutes a notable flaw that prevents the piece from achieving full publishability without revision.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the prose is generally clean, it is hampered by several instances of overwriting and cliché ("treasures from the detritus of forgotten lives," "budding bustle"). A particularly jarring sentence—"The attribute of the morning led through following"—is abstract and self-conscious, interrupting the narrative flow to explain its own structure. Such prose artifacts, along with overwrought similes, detract from the story's immediacy and polish.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious and frequently beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. At times, particularly in the opening, the density of figurative language is so high that it verges on being overwritten, slightly impeding momentum. The repetition of the central spider simile, while thematically coherent, feels a touch heavy-handed. Otherwise, the line-level craft is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is often lyrical and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, with vivid, well-chosen imagery. However, the piece is marred by a significant prose artifact: the repetition of "gleaming silence." Using this exact phrase four times in a short story constitutes a loop that an editor would immediately flag, creating a distracting echo that detracts from the otherwise high quality of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its high density of figurative language occasionally feels overwrought, slightly dulling momentum. There are minor instances of conceptual repetition and near-paraphrasing, such as the two consecutive sentences describing the "terrestrially cosmic" nature of the place. While the overall effect is strong, a touch more restraint would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong rhythm and precise word choice. However, a few moments slip into summary at crucial junctures where dramatization would be stronger. For instance, the line explaining that the lies were "masking his own motive to protect the building's secrets" is a moment of telling that slightly deflates the tension of the reveal. It's a minor flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from a persistent density of figurative language that verges on overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor ("shadows draped...like forgotten veils," "resolve settle over her like mist"), which cumulatively blurs clarity and dulls the momentum of the climactic action. This density violates the principle of economy and creates a prose artifact that, while not breaking causality, significantly weighs down the narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.3)
    While often beautiful, the prose is burdened by significant mechanical repetition and overwriting that would require editorial intervention. Key phrases—"pearl twilight," "wisely enduring," "calibrated treason"—are used as recurring labels rather than evolving motifs, creating a templated feel. This artifact, combined with a uniform sentence structure, dulls the momentum and prevents the otherwise strong piece from achieving stylistic flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense with evocative imagery and lyrical phrasing, creating a distinct texture. Information density is high, with sentences often performing multiple functions. While generally clear and propulsive, the sheer volume of figurative language in the opening paragraphs occasionally verges on overwhelming, and the phrase "reed-like sorrow" is a minor slip in metaphorical coherence. However, it does not obscure clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with memorable phrases like "slushy memories of a world unthawed." However, it frequently tips into overwriting, with a high density of similes and metaphors that can feel decorative and slow the momentum. A more disciplined hand would have allowed the strongest images to stand out by trimming the surrounding figurative language, creating a cleaner and more propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its density sometimes slows momentum and reveals minor artifacts. The repetition of key phrases ("demure audacity," "scintillatingly somber") feels like a tic rather than a deliberate motif. Some figurative language, while striking ("tears sparkling on a mourner's cheek"), contributes to a uniform texture of high lyricism that could benefit from more variation and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is generally clear, but it suffers from notable text artifacts, particularly the repetitive use of the phrase "sharply observant" three times. The most significant failure is the final block of text, which is not prose but a collection of writer's notes, false starts, and scaffolding. This chaotic assemblage of fragments fundamentally fails the standards of line-level craft required for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often lands with vivid, memorable images ("refracting lightning into sapphire shards"). However, it suffers from overwriting, with a high density of adjectives and figurative language that can feel heavy and slow the pace. Phrases like "promises of doom and delight" or "gritty, whimsical bark" are evocative but contribute to a texture that is more declared than felt, and a few paraphrase loops slightly dull the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it is significantly marred by repetitive phrasing. Key phrases like "lonesome splendor," "gleaned redemption," "feral," "sweetening," and "at dawn's earliest whistle" are reused, creating a loop-like quality that dulls their impact. This textual artifact prevents the otherwise strong prose from achieving the clarity and momentum required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often elegant and dense with vivid imagery. However, there are instances of conceptual reiteration, such as the detailed explanation of "sonic absolution" immediately after its introduction, which slightly impede propulsion. Some descriptions also lean into abstract language, making the line-level craft occasionally less immediate and more declarative, reducing fluidity.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with strong imagery. The primary flaw is the repetition of key thematic phrases ("restrained wildness," "softly purposeful"), which functions as a prose artifact or scaffold. While thematically relevant, this template-like recurrence in the final third dulls the line-level momentum and prevents the piece from reaching the highest echelon of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally clear but is hindered by overwriting and a reliance on scaffolding phrases. Repetitive, label-like terms ("empirical observation," "watchfully calm") and strained figurative language ("the tunnel's drip resuming like applause") dull the momentum. While sentences are grammatically sound, there's a lack of concision and propulsion, with several clauses that could be trimmed to heighten the tension in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is often lyrical and precise, it is significantly marred by conspicuous repetition. The threefold use of both "aptly deliberate" and "vibrant hush," along with the twice-used "calm before realization," creates a distracting loop. These prose artifacts feel like scaffolding and detract from the otherwise strong craft, preventing the piece from achieving a truly polished, publishable state.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and propelled by strong verbs and evocative, specific imagery. Sentences are crafted with a jeweler's eye, achieving high information density without feeling overwritten or sacrificing clarity. The rhythm and syntax vary effectively to match the story's pace, building from methodical work to the climactic, resonant peal of the bell. There are no notable prose artifacts; the execution is clean and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Figurative language, such as data as a "persistent watermark on the fabric of the net," is both fresh and functional. The only minor flaw is the slightly clunky repetition of the phrase "brightly attentive," which feels more like a prompt element being serviced than an organic descriptor. However, this is a hairline fissure in an otherwise polished and powerful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific, evocative imagery ("words sharp as cracking ice"). However, there are moments of overwriting where the language becomes more ornamental than functional, such as "shadow-laced peacekeeper." The description of her "reconstituting" the shard by "piecing empathy's fragments into a coherent whole" is a conceptual summary that stalls momentum in a key beat, telling us the meaning of the action rather than letting the action carry the meaning itself.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is consistently strong, marked by evocative imagery and a confident rhythm. However, a few moments of over-articulation slightly mar the otherwise seamless craft. The simile "her patience folding like the creases in the lace tip" is a bit too tidy, a writerly construction that draws attention to itself. This minor tendency to explain its own metaphors prevents the prose from reaching flawless execution, though its overall quality remains very high.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often lyrical, the prose is hindered by significant artifacts. There's a tendency toward abstract, academic language ("fostering an intersubjective understanding that bridged their separate sorrows") that overwrites the emotion of the scene. This register drift is a recurring issue that dulls momentum and clarity in key beats. The prose tells the reader the psychological subtext instead of letting the concrete details of the scene do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is consistently elegant and evocative, with a strong, rhythmic cadence. The density of figurative language is high, which, while effective, occasionally borders on overwriting and slightly slows momentum. A minor repetitive use of the phrase "strangely honest" is the only notable flaw in an otherwise polished and professional execution.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is the story's most significant weakness due to severe repetition and overwriting. Key words ("vines," "arc," "subtle," "linger," "earnest," "whimsical") are recycled to the point of becoming artifacts that dull momentum. The constant high density of figurative language feels strenuous rather than evocative, and paraphrase loops obscure the story's underlying elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but its high density of abstract concepts ("obsolete triumph," "weathered innocence") occasionally slows momentum. Minor redundancies appear, such as "suspended hush, a profound quietude," which slightly dilute the otherwise strong line-level craft without derailing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmically sophisticated, with high information density in most lines. The figurative language, like "skin folding like waves receding from shore," is often stunning. The score is held back by a few minor blemishes, such as a cliché simile ("fog parting reluctantly like a lover") and the summarizing, scaffold-like nature of the final sentence, which feels less crafted than the prose preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it is overwritten. A high density of figurative language and recurring abstract labels ("luminous," "ephemeral," "ache") creates a sense of synonym churn that dulls emotional impact. The final paragraph is a key weakness, summarizing plot and theme in a way that feels like scaffolding left in the final product.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is often elegant, it is significantly marred by repetitive phrasing and template-cadence artifacts. Key phrases like "pulsing stillness," "radiant haven," "decisively," and "reunify" are used multiple times, functioning as thematic labels rather than organic description. This looping creates a scaffold-like quality that dulls the momentum and gives the prose a sense of being assembled rather than composed.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, with strong imagery ("constellations had shifted like melting wax"). However, the piece is marred by a significant text artifact: the phrase "quietly deliberate" is used three times, forming a clear and distracting loop. This repetition disrupts the otherwise professional flow and feels like a drafting scaffold left in the final text.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is severely hampered by a pervasive text artifact: the relentless repetition of specific keywords and phrases. This creates synonym churn and looping concepts ("nostalgic innovation," "shrewdly innocent," "cleft in certainty") that read like scaffolding left in the final draft. This mechanical insertion makes many sentences feel forced and unnatural, significantly reducing momentum and clarity, especially in the story's second half where the density of these repetitions increases.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is often beautiful and evocative, it suffers from a relentless density of figurative language that borders on overwriting. The recurrence of key phrases, such as "zephyr bloom" appearing three times, creates a noticeable prose artifact that slightly dulls its impact. The line-level craft is strong, but a more judicious use of metaphor, especially during moments of high emotion, would increase the story's propulsive power.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lyrical and often beautiful, but it occasionally suffers from overwriting, with a density of figurative language that can slow momentum. Sentences like "fractal veins of water tracing paths like veins of memory, revealing hidden symmetries in the chaos" are ambitious but heavy. While there are no egregious errors, a lighter touch in peak descriptive moments would heighten the story's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is evocative and imagistic, but it is severely hampered by a critical flaw: heavy repetition of keywords. Terms like "solemnize," "lucidly watchful," "swirling hush," and "feral" are used so frequently they become textual artifacts, creating a template cadence that dulls momentum. This looping of specific, conspicuous vocabulary is the story's most significant weakness, overriding its other line-level strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often beautiful and evocative, with strong imagery and a consistent rhythm. However, it suffers from minor but noticeable repetition of key descriptive words and phrases ("whimsical," "gathering hush," "everything aligned"). This lexical looping, while not severe enough to obscure meaning, slightly dulls the otherwise sharp line-level craft and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, yet maintains clarity and momentum, a difficult balance to strike. Word choice is precise and evocative ("clawed at the perpetual twilight," "pinpricks of safekept starlight"), and sentence structures vary to create a mesmerizing rhythm that supports the story's ritualistic pace. While verging on ornate, the richness feels purposeful, contributing directly to the accumulative pressure required by the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and dense, but its momentum is impeded by a noticeable prose artifact. The repetition of key phrases like "peripherally focused" and "reflective" functions as a scaffold, stating the character's attribute rather than fully embedding it in varied action or syntax. This tic prevents an otherwise strong piece from achieving line-level flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often stunning, with a high information rate per sentence. However, its very richness occasionally tips into near-overwriting. Phrases like "reverie thicker than bone" feel slightly strained, and the explicit definition "Shingled hush, that core silence layered like overlapping roof tiles" is a minor authorial intrusion. While the overall effect is powerful and controlled, these hairline cracks prevent a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by a strong, melancholic rhythm. Figurative language, especially the central metaphor of "crystallized time," is potent and sustained. Sentences are crafted with precision and clarity. There are no significant loops or artifacts, though a few minor, common phrases ("hollow in her chest") and a slight tendency to explain motivation prevent a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently elegant and evocative, with high information density and a strong, controlled rhythm. Figurative language is rich but purposeful, building the unique atmosphere without becoming overwrought or obscuring meaning. There are no notable line-level artifacts, loops, or scaffolding; the craft is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is often elegant and precise, with strong imagery. However, it sometimes slips into overwriting with dense, abstract conceptual phrases ("maze of intentions, where the terminal's labyrinthine corridors twisted like unspoken desires deferred"). This tendency towards abstraction and a few instances of elevated diction slightly weigh down the momentum in an otherwise clean execution.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from overwriting and repetition that dull its impact. Key phrases like "glacial hush" and "excruciatingly gentle" are repeated to the point of becoming artifacts rather than reinforcing motifs. This synonym-looping, particularly in the final third, undercuts the climax and suggests a need for a more rigorous line-edit to achieve publishable concision and power.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lyrical and dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. For the most part, its ambition pays off, creating a rich texture. However, there are minor artifacts that slightly dull the immediacy, such as label-like phrases ("his mind was thoughtfully clear") and a slight tendency toward abstraction in key moments ("serene upheaval of evening's quiet rebellion"). While effective, these moments occasionally tell what could be more powerfully shown through action or sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is hampered by overwriting. The density of similes and metaphors is so high ("like forgotten sunlight," "like spectral fingers," "like a shroud," "like petals") that it begins to blunt its own impact. The verbatim repetition of "infinitely patient" and "oceanic hush" functions as a noticeable prose artifact, preventing the line-level craft from reaching an exceptional tier.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, marked by strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it occasionally tips into overwriting, with a density of figurative language that can feel slightly labored ("golden foliage drifted like forgotten memories," "weight of isolation settling like dew"). There are also minor repetitions of key words ("lonesome splendor," "intimately") that, while thematic, slightly dull the edge of an otherwise sharp and poetic piece.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is often lyrical and evocative, it is significantly marred by repetitive phrasing. The words "hypothesized," "reverie," "flawed," and "genesis" are used as recurring crutches, forming conceptual loops that slow momentum and reduce information density. This artifact is prominent enough to prevent the story from reaching the highest echelon of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and imagistically dense, with strong verbs and specific detail. The rhythm is controlled, shifting from longer, descriptive sentences to shorter, more active ones during the grafting. While mostly disciplined, there's a slight tendency towards overwriting in the opening paragraph, with a high density of figurative language that feels slightly effortful. Otherwise, the line-level craft is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from significant artifacting. Key descriptors ("luminous," "defiant hush," "sidereal patience") are used as recurring tags, functioning like prompt keywords and dulling their impact. This repetition, combined with a tendency towards abstract phrasing over concrete action, constitutes a form of overwriting that slows momentum and feels stylistically forced.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains many evocative, lyrical lines that build a strong atmosphere. However, the piece is weakened by the repetitive use of key abstract phrases ("troubling serenity," "approximates infinity"), which function as thematic labels that create conceptual loops and dull the immediacy of the final beats through overuse.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is often beautiful and evocative. However, its primary weakness is the mechanical repetition of key phrases from the prompt, most notably "thundering calm" (four times) and "fiercely meditative" (twice). This creates a template-cadence feel in places, a prose artifact that slightly dulls the otherwise organic flow and reads like authorial scaffolding. Removing these redundancies would elevate the piece to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmic, but occasionally burdened by overwriting and a density of modifiers ("jagged spine of black volcanic glass," "spectral yet achingly real"). Some phrasing, like "ethically diligent" or "incremental absolution," feels more like conceptual labeling than organic language. While the line-level craft is strong, a stricter economy would heighten its impact, particularly in the explanatory sentences within the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is often evocative, it suffers from overwriting and repetitive phrasing. The repeated use of "velveteen gloom," "uncharted echoes," and "blithe" functions as a loop that dulls momentum and creates an artificial texture. Several sentences are laden with figurative language that, while pretty, reduces information density and slows the pace without a corresponding rise in tension.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and purposeful, with a varied sentence structure that maintains propulsion throughout a largely static scene. Figurative language is consistently striking and tonally coherent, such as the ice as an "unyielding parchment." There are no wasted words or line-level artifacts; every phrase contributes to atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmic, but marred by a noticeable repetition of key thematic words ("thistled calm," "elusive," "cloaking," "secretly"). This lexical looping, while thematically relevant, creates a slight mechanical feel that dulls the otherwise strong line-level craft. It reads as a prose artifact that a final polish would need to address, preventing the story from achieving flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional clarity, density, and rhythmic control. Sentences are crafted with precision, carrying thematic weight and advancing the narrative simultaneously, such as describing the powder that would "seal the mask's seams, binding truth's fragments without revealing the full fracture." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding. The elevated, figurative language feels earned and consistent with the artistic context, contributing to the story's momentum rather than hindering it.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with strong, varied rhythms. The line-level craft is mostly excellent, though it occasionally brushes against overwriting with its high density of figurative language. The repetition of the key phrase "rationally rebellious" functions more as a thematic label than an organic piece of prose, creating a minor scaffold-like effect.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with high information density and strong figurative language. However, the story suffers from conceptual looping, with key phrases ("expectantly resigned," "vanishing arts," "unlearning hatred," "traveled stillness") recurring to the point of becoming noticeable tics. While this repetition serves a thematic purpose, it slightly dulls the propulsion and creates a sense of a limited conceptual palette, preventing the line-level craft from reaching true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    While grammatically clean, the prose trends toward overwriting and abstraction, often telling the reader the emotional or thematic importance of an act rather than letting the concrete image do the work. The density of figurative language and conceptual nouns ("synaptic plasticity," "symphony of past and possibility") can obscure momentum and feel performative.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density. However, a minor slip into thematic summary occurs with the line "...his motivation clear...to transform this crisis into a riddle's adventure, keeping routine from devouring wonder." This moment of telling, rather than showing, slightly flattens an otherwise impeccable execution by stating the theme directly.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and rhythmic, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Its momentum is generally excellent, pulling the reader through the quiet scene. The score is held back by occasional patches of overwriting where the figurative language becomes slightly too dense or self-conscious ("hushed reverence that blazed like embers under ash"), detracting from the otherwise pristine clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear and evocative, but it is significantly weakened by a clear prose artifact. The sequence of revelations uses a repetitive template cadence ("The first revelation hit...", "The next truth cascaded...", "The third revelation poured forth..."), which disrupts the narrative flow and feels mechanical. This structural repetition is a notable flaw in an otherwise competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and highly effective, with strong, resonant phrasing ("Möbius strip writ large," "surgical rift"). It achieves high information density, with most sentences serving character, concept, and tone simultaneously. While the figurative language is powerful, a few moments verge on being slightly overwritten, a hairline slip that keeps it just shy of flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is consistently beautiful and evocative, demonstrating strong control of rhythm and syntax. However, the density of figurative language is relentless, occasionally bordering on overwriting. In the opening paragraph, nearly every clause contains a metaphor or simile ("saffron quiet," "forgotten whispers," "threads of unraveling canvas," "city's breath," "veiled promise," "captured dreams"), which slightly dulls the impact of individual images through sheer saturation rather than allowing key moments to breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong sentence-level propulsion. Phrases like "wove their histories into this damp sanctuary" are precise and atmospheric. There are minor instances of slightly overwrought figurative language ("viewing history through a lens of preserved envy") that border on purple prose, but they don't obscure meaning or harm the momentum of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains striking imagery but is critically flawed by the patterned repetition of key phrases: "bleak exhilaration" (4x), "neatly inventive" (3x), and "latent radiance" (3x). This verbal tic acts as a scaffold, dulling momentum and reading like an artifact of the story's construction, which is unacceptable for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with evocative imagery and a varied sentence rhythm. However, it occasionally suffers from overwriting, with dense clusters of figurative language that slow momentum ("illuminating horrors in soft, ethereal hues that made the repulsive beauty of the place intoxicating"). The clarity of the climax is slightly obscured by the abstract nature of the action, but there are no significant line-level artifacts like loops or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with a high density of figurative language that establishes the story's unique atmosphere. However, it occasionally slips into abstraction where concrete detail would be stronger (e.g., "generating fractal echoes that spiderwebbed through the bark"). While the style is largely successful, this tendency toward high-concept description over embodied action creates minor drags on momentum in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery. However, two crucial moments at the climax rely on abstract summary—"a Eureka of terror" and "grief-laced resolve"—which slightly blunt the immediacy of the character's experience. These minor artifacts are the primary flaw preventing the story from achieving near-perfection on the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often beautiful, with high information density. There are no significant artifacts or loops. The primary weakness is a minor tendency toward overwritten phrases where a concrete image is paired with an abstract explanation (e.g., "windows shattered like broken promises"), which slightly dulls the propulsion of an otherwise sharp and evocative style.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lyrical and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. Sentences are well-crafted, creating a consistent rhythm that supports the story's "hushed blaze" tone. The piece loses some points for moments of overwriting where the density of figurative language slightly impedes momentum, and for the repetition of key thematic phrases which, while intentional, feels a touch heavy-handed in such a short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clear, concise, and evocative. However, the piece is marred by noticeable repetition of key phrases ("tranquilly perceptive," "reclaimed stillness," and especially "dappled"). While potentially thematic, this repetition functions as a text artifact, creating a scaffold-like feel that slightly dulls the momentum and information density of the lines. This loop-like quality is the primary weakness preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional line-level craft, with high information density, varied sentence structures, and a natural, propulsive rhythm. Figurative language is consistently evocative and precise, enriching the atmosphere and Elias's emotional journey without any muddle or excess. There are no instances of loops, scaffold, or other line-level artifacts, maintaining peak clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is ambitious, with strong verbs and evocative imagery, particularly in the opening. However, the story is significantly hampered by prose artifacts, specifically high-priority loops. The phrases "bleak exhilaration," "intangibly tangible," and "unused potential" are each repeated four or more times, creating a template cadence that dulls the impact of pivotal moments and reduces the information density of the prose through redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often luminous and evocative. However, the piece is marred by repetitive phrasing artifacts that dull its momentum. The phrase "brilliant dimness" appears four times and "perpetually surprised" three times, creating noticeable loops that feel more like authorial tics than intentional refrains. This redundancy, a form of scaffolding, slightly undermines the otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often lyrical and evocative, with strong phrases like "sieved hush." However, it occasionally slips into overwriting, relying on familiar literary similes ("like ink in water") and abstract emotional nouns ("twilight's regret," "fabricated sorrow"). While the overall quality is high, a more rigorous trimming of these slightly generic constructions would elevate the line-level craft to an exceptional standard.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often elegant and rhythmic, with strong opening imagery. However, it is hampered by a recurring conceptual loop, with the word "recycle" and its synonyms used multiple times, which feels like authorial scaffolding. Occasional abstractions ("labyrinth of what-ifs") and direct labels ("unintended symbolism") slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is often lyrical and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. This craft makes the failure of the final paragraph all the more glaring. The presence of bracketed, non-narrative text is a severe prose artifact that breaks the story's integrity, overriding any prior line-level successes. It reads as scaffolding that was never removed.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains strong imagery, but is marred by a significant artifact: the repetitive and inorganic phrase "delicately robust," which appears twice in key descriptions. This forced repetition feels like a response to an external constraint, creating an artificial seam in the narrative texture and dulling the prose's overall effectiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery. However, the piece is weakened by noticeable repetition artifacts—specifically the recycling of the key phrases "paradoxically steady" and "cosmic intimacy." This synonym churn creates a loop that slightly dulls the momentum and gives the prose a templated feel in those moments, preventing an otherwise strong piece from achieving top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with a rich, poetic texture. However, the density of figurative language occasionally verges on overwriting, slightly impeding momentum ("each breath a tangle of ethereal vapors that clung to her lungs like forbidden secrets, beautiful yet suffocating in their infinite whisper"). While mostly effective, a touch more restraint would elevate the piece to flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often elegant, but it is hampered by minor, recurring flaws. There is a pattern of conceptual repetition (e.g., the multiple uses of "ghostly resolve") and a tendency for sentences to state a concept and then explain it. While the rhythm is controlled, these small scaffolding artifacts prevent the prose from achieving the effortless propulsion required for a top score.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, it suffers from overwriting and repetition, particularly with key phrases like "vibrant hush" and "texture of transformation." This verbal tic, combined with occasional shifts from lyrical prose to blunt exposition, creates an uneven texture that slightly dulls the story's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting and repetitive lexical fields. Words like "hush," "silent," "whisper," and "wink" are used to the point of becoming a prose artifact, dulling their impact. The density of figurative language ("shimmered like captured starlight," "velvet darkness," "keyhole slits," "defiant whisper") in the opening paragraphs slows momentum rather than building it, a key flaw for a story aiming for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, the density of figurative language is extremely high, verging on overwriting in a few passages where similes and metaphors are stacked closely together. While this choice largely serves the story's ethereal tone, a few moments could achieve greater impact with more concision, such as the slightly redundant phrasing used to establish her elusiveness at the start.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level craft is strong, with evocative imagery and controlled rhythm. The primary flaw is a minor but noticeable pattern of repetition; the phrases "storm-kissed wonder" and "furiously tranquil" are used twice, functioning as textual artifacts that slightly dull the prose's momentum. Otherwise, the language is clear, dense, and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative and clear, with strong rhythm. However, it is significantly marred by a recurring text artifact: paraphrase loops and repetitive key phrases. "Diplomatically fierce," "dignified chaos," and variations of "questions into destinations" appear multiple times, functioning as scaffolding that should have been removed. This repetition dulls the momentum and impact, preventing the prose from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a degree of overwriting and conceptual repetition. Motifs like "fracture," "luminous," "bloom," and "anarchy/chaos" are used so frequently that they lose some of their power, creating a sense of synonym churn around the central theme. While sentences are grammatically clean, the high density of figurative language in nearly every line can feel strenuous, slightly impeding narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose contains passages of striking beauty and inventive imagery, particularly in descriptions of the arbor. However, its overall quality is undermined by several prose artifacts. The phrase "the horizon inviting night" is repeated with slight variation, suggesting a template. The assertion "Elias was strategically creative" is also repeated, functioning as scaffolding. These redundancies, along with some clunky expository phrases, disrupt momentum and prevent the prose from being flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often evocative, the prose is significantly weakened by a pervasive prose artifact: the relentless repetition of the story's keywords. Phrases like "luminous doubt," "empirically," and "whimsical" are inserted so frequently that they create a template cadence, dulling the momentum and making the prose feel less organic. This issue is particularly acute in the final third, where it slightly flattens the otherwise powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is lyrical and evocative but suffers from overwriting. Figurative language is stacked too densely, particularly in the opening, with nearly every sentence containing a metaphor or simile ("sky bruised with cerulean regret," "mist diffused through the air like a sigh").

No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; occasional adjectival pairs (“humid decay,” “brackish water”) stay purposeful. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs dominate (“trudged,” “sagged,” “kindled”). One paraphrase echo—“humility kindled within her, a slow burn… / humility kindling brighter”—repeats concept, but within a short span it highlights progression rather than stalls. Final image is crisp and unforced.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is textured and propulsive, but stacked metaphors (“forbidden emeralds,” “liquid silver”) occasionally blur clarity; no loops or scaffold, yet a few sentences could lose modifiers without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence fronts diversify; paragraphs breathe. Figurative runs are dense but purposeful, taught early as performative narration; payoff at exit justifies load. Two micro-loops: “narrated onward, his tone a weighty lightness, profound yet playful” restates; “swirling like a captive storm” followed by “storm” image in next clause. No artifact touches closure; meaning stays clear. Prune those echoes and the prose would hit 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    High information density—sentences carry dual duty—yet occasional modifier strings (“rusted links clanging like applause”) verge on purple; no scaffold loops, only minor paraphrase.

One paraphrase loop—“mistrust…thawing…thaw”—but it fuses theme to image and does not stall climax.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences are dense yet fluid, each line advancing atmosphere or pressure; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise and consistent—cracks as healed scars, vines as weary curtains. Rhythm modulates with the ritual’s hush and the climactic hush alike.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “subdued awakenings” does double duty for creatures and revelation. Mixed metaphors avoided; “velvet indigo” is the single indulgence but fits POV.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template runs. Dense metaphor clusters occur but serve the hush motif and do not stall beats. One paraphrase loop: “regenerative silence” thrice in four lines mid-text; minor. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats; closure line is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence advances image or pressure. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sensory verbs (“crushing it to release its earthy scent”) replace abstractions. Final line’s lullaby echo is earned and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary in length to mirror Elias’s pulse—short when he freezes, longer during the methodical etching. No loops or scaffold; each clause advances image or stakes. The phrase “accidentally prophetic” is used once and earned by the scene, avoiding label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors (“like fog cloaking a thief’s intent”) serve pressure, not ornament. Minor loop echoes (“midnight blue” ×3) are purposeful. No mixed metaphors or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes: long sentences for thawing memory, staccato prepositional fragments for ticking clock. Metaphors are coherent—shell as baton, lake as sounding board—and never mixed within one beat. One paraphrase loop: “upturned hush” repeated without additive pressure; delete one instance. Otherwise zero scaffold, high density; every clause adds sensory or causal information. Line craft supports rather than obscures the final conducting image.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence lengths vary, paragraph cuts are purposeful. Figurative language is dense but patterned—light/drop/ripple—so it reads as deliberate texture, not purple. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; however, a few near-adjacent abstractions (“twisting maze within her mind where doubts and alternate lives coiled like serpents”) slow propulsion. The closing beat is clean, uncluttered, and lands with crystallised brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in cadence, accelerating with the crank of the phonograph, then breathing in the aftermath. No loops or redundant phrasing; each image advances mood or motive.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: each figurative layer (veins, frost, shards) returns to illuminate the grief beat, so density earns its keep. No loops or paraphrase stacks; rhythm modulates naturally. Purple risk peaks in “crystalline panes etched with frost-like veins” and “shimmering shadows,” yet the redundancy is minor and distant from closure, so only light deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    Charged lyric compression with vivid specificity—no loops or scaffold. Sentence propulsion supports pressure; metaphors (rope as “thread from time’s prison”) are clean and scalable to closure. Information density is high; no figurative muddle.

The prose earns its lyricism without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences couple scent chemistry, client memory, and interior shift. Mixed-metaphor guardrails hold—static maps emotional charge without overstretch. One scaffold pair (“She’d always sensed… Now…”) but it teaches pattern and vanishes before climax. A few adjectival stacks (“amber veins in the stone”) stay under threshold; no loops dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; sensory detail woven through action. Occasional elevated phrasing (“velvet night”) borders on decorative but doesn’t stall momentum. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    Purposeful compression, no loops. One metaphor drift: “luminescent ache” is lovely once, slightly strained on repetition yet does not obscure cause/effect. Read-aloud rhythm holds to the final line.

    Prose is vivid, compressed, and propulsive: “waters parted like curtains” anchors without overwriting; no loops or scaffold. Syntactic variety mirrors pressure waves; high information density advances story.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Most sentences carry dual duty (image + concept), but stacked epithets—“luminous fruit,” “sapphire-tinted crystal,” “infinite loops”—thicken mid-paragraph without new causality. One paraphrase loop (“orchard had grown still… silence”) and a mild template cadence in finger-motion clause; none reach closure, so cap stays sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean yet textured; sentences advance both atmosphere and motive. Occasional lyrical lift (“threads of magnetic tape still clinging…”) earns its place by charging the closure. No loops or scaffold; each detail recurs with altered weight. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he could almost hear…”) could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose propels: each sentence either advances transformation or grounds sensory detail; no paraphrase loops. Rhythm flexes—long horticultural cadences collapse into staccato heartbeats as takeover peaks. Mixed-metaphor risk (“jewels,” “emeralds”) lightly bruises clarity but does not obscure causality. Clean grammar, strong verbs, high information density; closure line is uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is textured yet disciplined: participle openings are sequential, metaphors stay physical, and information density remains high. Minor loop—“haggard awe” repeated verbatim—and a near-paraphrase pair (“wryly earnest, laced with a humor that twisted irony into quiet resolve”) slightly stall momentum, but artifacts never touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong rhythmic variety, high information density; most sentences dual-purpose. Two adjacent near-repeats (“bright darkness…luminous gloom”) and a mixed metaphor (“frozen notes…woven echoes”) dull edge in peak paragraph—minor artifact that keeps sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: no loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“reactively visionary”) nudges toward label-speak yet appears only once; overall density advances image or stakes with every sentence, earning its lyric surplus.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“living shroud,” “distant promises”) risk overwriting but never stall momentum. No loops or scaffold in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyric compression is purposeful; sentences advance image or causality without loops. Occasional elevated diction (“impossibly, Elara glimpsed”) reads as earned under peak pressure. Read-aloud rhythm supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm modulates—languid opening clauses accelerate into staccato glimpses during breach, mirroring emotional arc. Metaphors remain coherent (storm as heartbeat, prisms as lungs) without mixed collisions. High density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and world data (“curse igniting through the magnetic torrent”). One scaffold pair detected (“colours bleeding into one another as the storm’s fields amplified”)—minor, does not touch closure; −0.2 applied. Otherwise no loops, jargon, or purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances character or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“ink seeping like veins awakening”) are fresh and earned. Minor over-modification in “deathly vitality” phrase repetition, but it serves tonal cohesion and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences carry double duty (action + texture). Mixed-metaphor risk—“veins of the earth” beside “prismatic shards”—is rescued by the shared optic/organic field. One scaffold loop: “refract” is over-deployed as verb, noun, and metaphor in the final third, dulling the climactic descent. Otherwise, cadence modulates, paragraphs are trim, and no filter-verb clusters gum the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the accumulative design; only two adjacent paraphrase loops (“layered…layers”) appear, minor. Figurative language is dense but cohesive, never muddled; metaphors stay maritime and metallurgical. No scaffolding or synonym churn in peak beats. Clean grammar and tense throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    High-density lines carry two jobs (“dust motes dancing like forgotten constellations” paints setting + signals cosmic theme). Varied sentence openings, natural paragraph breaks. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold; only hairline slips—“gloomy cheerfulness” repeated thrice—keep it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold—each image (spiced kelp fritters, barnacle-crusted relic) is fresh and purposeful. Metaphors (gears of masks, phoenix from planks) cohere without muddle. Rhythm modulates naturally with tension; no filler.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; varied sentence fronts avoid drumbeat. Information density high—single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and world data (“Moonlight bathed the expansive bowl below in silvery melancholy, shadows pooling like forgotten dreams”). One mixed metaphor—”lattice of outposts and laser grids”—slight blur, but closure line is clean. No loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data and mechanical detail without redundancy. Occasional lyrical flourish (“jewel in the calm dawn”) is earned by prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density—most sentences serve two jobs; figurative strings are purposeful, tied to cartography. One mixed vehicle (“iron walls flaking like old skin beside...ice”) nicks clarity; no loops or filler in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and cadenced, emulating bell resonance; occasional adjective stacks (“weathered stones, carved with runes that seemed to pulse faintly”) flirt with purple but serve the acoustic texture. No paraphrase loops; information density is high. One mixed metaphor—“heartbeat long dormant” applied to stone hum—barely blurs clarity. Closure line is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language purposeful (“crystal facets like captured starlight”). No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“lonesome splendor”) fits lyric mode. One mixed metaphor—“weight pressing on body and hope”—minor.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is sculpted and musical—“winter-cracked fields lay silent”—yet every image (soot-gray mist, frost-kissed petals) serves momentum rather than decoration. Loops and scaffold are absent; compression heightens as Elias’s resolve erodes “like acid on parchment” without overwriting the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Occasional ornate phrasing (“petals of quiet hope”) skirts purple but serves the tonal register. No loops or scaffold; final line anchors motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong noun-verb pairs (“roots snaked between skeletal remains”) and varied paragraphing.  Filter-verb clusters (“she felt,” “she envisioned”) soften immediacy; occasional stacked adjectives (“sun-baked valley,” “shadowed dance”) flirt with overwriting without pattern payoff.  No loops near closure, but figurative density remains high unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence carries sensory + symbolic load without purple drift. One scaffold paraphrase loop (“golden arcade at dawn…amber glow”) costs −0.3; otherwise rhythm modulates, verbs stay strong, and closure image lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and musical, with only minor loops (“whispers that no one else seemed to hear” echoes twice). Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm accelerates during synchronization, matching urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates fluid cadences with clipped incantations; no template runs. Figurative language is selective—moonlight “healed” the shard once—never clutters high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds sensory or causal layer. Opening anchors voice and stake; final line recharges “rewrite the stars” with earned cosmological tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm modulates effectively; no template runs. Some adjacent near-paraphrase (“fragile lives pieced together in this fragile peace”) trims propulsion. Metaphors stay coherent—coral/neurons, mist/veil—anchored to POV. Clean copy; only minor scaffold keeps the prose from full bite.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong rhythmic variety and concrete nouns propel the piece. Only two adjacent paraphrase loops (“lost joy…faded from his waking life, buried under commissions”; “pensive mirth…bubbling up”) create micro-drag—scaffold −0.2. Figurative chain is dense but consistent under dream lens. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beat. Final third is clean, so 9+ is not disallowed.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with echo-decay; sentence openings vary, verbs strong (“coalesced,” “ricochet,” “nested”). Information density strong: “She slipped the hobo nickel…its carved fox seeming to wink…” does three jobs in one line. One mixed-metaphor risk: “waves undulating under a sky heavy with unspoken queries” (sky = heavy?) yet it passes as poetic license. Clean copy, no loops or scaffolds.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with purposeful repetition (“candidly cryptic”) that patterns rather than loops. Occasional lushness (“iridescent beetles swarmed in erratic spirals”) risks overwriting but stays tethered to POV urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is musical, but metaphor density borders on purple for entire paragraphs; one paraphrase loop and repeated compound epithets (“reef-shadow joy,” “shyly unstoppable”) create template cadence. Syntax remains clear, pronouns anchored, no scaffolding beyond the noted loop. The final bloom image lands cleanly despite prior density.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and musical, with purposeful repetition and syntactic variety. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and never muddles causality. Occasional stacked modifiers (“phonetic ghosts that once bound souls to their histories”) risk overwriting but remain within voice limits.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty—"ink that shimmered like liquid midnight, infused with essences from the archive's deepest vaults" fuses metaphor, world rule, and stakes in one breath. No synonym loops; each glyph stroke adds new pressure, preventing repetition. Read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally; comma-anchored cadence mimics musical phrasing without algorithmic monotony. No mixed metaphors or scaffold; even the climactic "chord that echoed through the vaults" recycles established sonic logic rather than introducing stray vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers action, atmosphere, and thought. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (volcano’s breath, dust motes like memories) are precise and purposeful, never mixed.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, memory, and motion. Metaphors (motes as memory particles, meteorite as talisman) are precise and never mixed. No loops or scaffold. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    Information-dense sentences layer image, memory, and tactile cue without paraphrase loops; only “fractured hush” repeats verbatim. Metaphors stay coherent—wind-swept plains in grain, prism shards in sky—but two adjacent “like” similes in the climax blunt momentum. Otherwise clean grammar, precise tense, and purposeful paragraphing propel the read.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean yet imagistic; sentences carry dual duty (action + atmosphere) with natural rhythmic variation. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; “subway map” for bioluminescent veins is the only extended vehicle and it holds. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs like “crunched,” “pulsing,” “wove” propel. One paraphrase hiccup: “shadowseam wonder” repeated in proximate clauses, a –0.2 artifact not touching closure, keeping 9+ band open.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences fuse action, image, and emotional valence (“glass warmed, transliterating…”). Metaphors are coherent—cement/cliff, foam/wave, seed/route—and avoid mixed collisions. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances pattern or pressure. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“transliterate,” “conceptual”) momentally lifts register above Elara’s experiential voice, a hairline slip preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; sentences vary in length and opening, avoiding drumbeat cadence. Figurative layering is high but pattern-taught early (“calculated wilderness”) and paid off at closure, so density penalty is waived. Minor loop near-miss: “monotony” appears four times in close proximity; not enough to dull momentum. No mixed metaphors or scaffold redundancy in the final third, keeping 9+ eligibility intact.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    High figurative density stays purposeful under lyric mode; mixed light metaphors never collide. Repetition of “obsidian grace” becomes incantatory but edges paraphrase-loop; filter verbs minimal. Strong paragraph cuts, varied sentence openings, momentum breathes with beats.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentences vary, paragraphs breathe. Occasional near-luxuriant phrase (“pearlescent glow,” “noctilucent reckoning”) but density suits reflective beat; no mixed metaphors or loops. Final line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is vivid and selective: each sentence advances image or memory without scaffold. Occasional poetic intensifiers (“eternal waltz,” “velvet sky”) flirt with excess yet remain consistent with the lyrical brief. No loops, mixed metaphors, or template cadences; opening and closing images are precise anchors. One paraphrase tic (“bargained away…trading it”) repeats but does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, each sentence layering image and concept; occasional poetic stacking (“polished to a glassy sheen by relentless tides”) risks overwriting but stays within the taught pattern. No loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but propulsive; metaphors (“veins of green memory”) serve mood without clutter. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph crystallizes earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and musical, each sentence layering sensory detail and forward motion; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“melancholic symphony”) fits the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, almost liturgical; sentence variety supports the ritual crescendo without monotony. Information density is high—smoke, herbs, celestial motion woven through action. A few stacked epithets (“weathered stones whispered of empires long crumbled”) flirt with excess, but no mixed metaphors or loops obstruct clarity at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ground a cracked mosaic of white desolation under a sky bruised” does double descriptive work. Metaphors stay consistent—salt as bone, cracks as wings—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold spot: “He had studied it for weeks…” could compress, but it occurs early and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; stacked metaphors are purposeful but dense, risking purple haze (“rainbows across the snow, each facet alive…”). No loops or paraphrase; pronouns clean. One participle opener mis-sequences simultaneous acts, minor clarity dip.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm modulates from long atmospheric sentences to staccato resolve; paragraphs vary visually. Most figurative language is purposeful, but “meteor hush” appears four times in 700 words, edging toward mantra without fresh inflection late. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; pronoun and tense clean. Information density high—single sentences fold setting, body, and metaphor together effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and musical; a few stacked metaphors (“blushing stillness,” “aurora against the clouded horizon”) flirt with excess but never stall momentum or obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (action + image). Occasional modifier stacks (“translucent ice veined with luminous quartz”) flirt with excess but stay tied to craft eye. No loops or scaffold detected. Final paragraph could trim one “echo” repetition, yet momentum survives. Generally propulsive and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    High density, varied rhythm, and zero loops; figurative language is selective and thematic—no muddle in the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify, paragraphs breathe. High density—star geometry, void energy, devotional sigils layered without scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“covenant with the unknown,” “formless yet beckoning”) flirts with grandeur but stays motive-consistent. No loops, mixed metaphors, or filter stacks; tile’s pulse image remains clear through close.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “resentment must be released, not harbored like a thief in the night” does triple duty—theme, image, foreshadowing. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is precise; “cellular memory” is introduced early and paid off. Only one near-mixed metaphor—“bridge to healing”—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “frost’s gleam turned the fog into a veil of fractured light” does triple sensory work. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Strategic telling compresses backstory in two lines. Only micro-slip: “runaway dream had escaped him” is near-paraphrase of earlier clause.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet limpid: “vines heavy with fruit twisted through cracked arches” packs sight, weight, and ruin. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are precise—“leaking wisdom like sap”—and never strain. Final cadence slows to crystallize the reparative act without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong information density—most sentences advance image or concept. Repetitive “brightened disquiet / simply complicated” pairing and stacked similes in final third slow momentum; no clarity break, but cadence loops dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical yet dense—three consecutive stacked metaphors in high-pressure beats create mild muddle. A few near-repeat phrases (“labyrinthine,” “unheard symphony”) could be pruned without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    High-density lines carry triple duty—image, emotion, world-rule—without scaffold. Occasional poetic overlay (“unkindled solace”) risks abstraction, but metaphor axis holds: carnival = memory palace. No loops or mixed vehicles near closure; rhythm breathes with ship lurch.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elegant variation in sentence length, strong verbs (“thrummed,” “rewove,” “flickered”); one scaffold loop (“confused rhythms into harmonious clarity”) but no mixed metaphors or density clog; filter verbs minimal and motive-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and mythic registers without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful—“lightning in a parched sky” foreshadows the bloom’s electric silence. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Minor alliteration (“forgotten waters,” “fragile clarity”) serves rhythm rather than ornament. Final image crystallizes earlier motifs without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lean yet textured—“frost-etched rails,” “thistle-blown hope.” Occasional poetic stacking (“earth’s own breath captured within”) skirts purple but serves atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; information density high. One mixed metaphor—“thistle-light hope”—barely audible.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences are dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold, figurative language is purposeful, and the final cadence lands cleanly without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is propulsive, each sentence layering texture without redundancy. Metaphors (“vines unfurling like conspirators”) are precise and purposeful. Minor scaffold—“the rag’s weight a talisman”—is earned by context. No loops or mixed metaphors mar the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“stars seemed to dance within the tidal pools”) is earned and purposeful. Sentence variety mirrors the ebb and flow; no register drift. Final line anchors by image, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “gilded hush…tasting of warm honey and aged gold” compresses synesthesia without purple overload. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image, stakes, or body. Participles are sequential, not simultaneous. One mixed metaphor—“treasure against the encroaching pull that mirrored her father’s bunkers”—slightly blurs physicality, but it lies outside the climax beat. Rhythm modulates with gravity shift, propelling toward the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is fluid and rhythmic, with only minor loops (“vaulting hush” twice in close proximity). Metaphors cohere; no line-level artifact obscures the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong cadence and vivid diction, yet some sentences stack modifiers (“holographic ghosts of ancient forests flickered against rain-slicked towers”) that could tighten for propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“anchor in the void,” “starlight’s cold watch”) are precise and purposeful; no mixed vehicles or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose carries momentum: varied sentence length, strong verbs (“twisted the bolt free,” “funnelled through”). Occasional elevated phrasing (“submerged histories,” “quantum veil”) risks register drift but stays consistent with concept-manifest world. No loops, paraphrase, or scaffold. Metaphors remain coherent; closure image sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences are dense, rhythmic, and purposeful; figurative language is controlled and pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold; the final image of “golden shadows that now seemed to mourn” lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory detail without loops. Metaphors ("ink in water," "mercury") are specific and coherent. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold; the final cascade of light is rendered in tight, vivid strokes that crystallize the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with rhythmic variation and sensory specificity. Minor loop—“dust motes danced…dust had formed delicate swirls”—dilutes momentum slightly. No figurative muddle at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm varies from long breathless arcs to staccato beats mirroring stealth. Minor paraphrase loop on “plans unravel” and one mixed metaphor (“embers…fog”) but no clog at climax. High density: most sentences double-task exposition and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, each sentence advancing atmosphere or pressure; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops, no mixed metaphors, and the final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective (“mist rising like ghosts”). Occasional scaffold—“uncertainly certain” repeated—dulls edge slightly but never during peak beats. Rhythm accelerates with danger, then lingers on the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Read-aloud ear: varied sentence ingress, no template cadence. High density—“ground aurum powder with rainwater…symbolize Lirra's untamed curiosity” does three jobs in one clause. Metaphors telegraphed but precise: starlight vapors, gravity of names. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes, final line resolves by image (guiding star). Only hairline slip: “factually mystical” used twice, slight register blush, but within POV tech-lexicon and does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is vivid, selective, propulsive. “Luminous ache threading” balances specificity without purple clutter. No loops or paraphrase churn. Metaphors (heat-haze over stone) serve clarity. Final image (“joy echoing eternally”) crystallizes without figurative muddle. Clean grammar, no missing anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; no loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (“roots twisting through unfamiliar soil”) serve pressure, not ornament. Rhythm accelerates with trauma flash, then steadies with the vow. Clean mechanics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Metaphors (fog solidifying, moonlit lens) are precise, never purple. No loops or scaffold; “elusively tangible” recurs with reweighted meaning. Final cadence slows to crystallize closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, concrete, high-density; each sentence advances image or causality without scaffold. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; metaphor when used (“confetti from a forgotten party”) is brief and scene-rooted. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts land on choice beats. Minor filter slip (“he realized”) is quickly compensated by immediate physical interaction with the barrel.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density, zero loops or filler. Metaphors (frost as forgotten script, glass fruits breathing) are precise and non-contradictory. Syntax modulates with pressure—long, winding sentences yield to staccato fragments as collapse nears. Clean grammar, strong verbs, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from languid cadence to staccato shard-scraps during inscription. Metaphors are baroque but internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. One scaffold paraphrase loop (“burnished sorrow” appears twice) costs −0.2. Otherwise sentences carry double duty—description advances mythopoeic argument. No filter-verb stacks or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual information. Metaphors are coherent—“rust like ivy”—and never stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; minor elevated diction fits the elevated stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and propulsive—high information ratio, rhythmic variety, zero loops. Figurative language is selective: “petrichor lingered like the earth itself remembered” anchors setting without overshadowing sense. Read-aloud test passes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked modifiers (“salt-slick air, turbine-hum reverie”) risk overwriting but serve the lyric pattern. No loops or filter-verb stacks; final image crystallizes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence variety avoids mechanical loops. Figurative language is selectively deployed—“colors that danced like forgotten dreams” risks cliché but stays justified by the muralist POV. One paraphrase loop detected (“snow melted…melting week”) costs minor propulsion. Otherwise high density: each line advances atmosphere or insight; pronouns track cleanly; no filter-verb clusters. Closure image remains unmarred by verbal overgrowth.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is propulsive, with rhythmic variation and high information density. Minor looped phrasing (“searing reverie,” “tension knotted”) slightly dulls peak beats but never obscures causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information density remains high: one sentence often performs scene, sensory filter, and world-rule (“Lanterns were relit, not with fire, but with glowing life…”). Rhythm modulates from reflective cadence to propulsive garden-staking close. A single mixed metaphor (“mental forge… ingredients in a potion”) is forgivable and early. Minor template stem repeats (“He recalled… He imagined…”) appear but do not touch the closure beat, keeping line-level craft firmly in the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density, minimal loops; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Occasional elevated diction (“verdant relic,” “genie’s wish”) stays within Elias’s scholarly register. No clarity issues or mixed metaphors in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with purposeful repetition (“furiously tranquil”) that teaches pattern. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “like forgotten breaths” and “like wild vines” verge on cliché but serve atmosphere. No loops or paraphrase stacks. Final line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lyric yet controlled—pine-resin glue, bronze saints etched—information density high. No loops or scaffold. Lines advance story or atmosphere without muddle. Meets 9+ ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with minimal loops; figurative language is purposeful. One template cadence (“his days blurred into nights”) and a mixed metaphor (“elegant blades of forgotten light”) are minor artifacts that do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentence variety, and high density—“hands eternally reaching for combs that no longer existed” does three jobs. One paraphrase loop: “unspoken words” / “mute eloquence” twice in close succession; minor. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clusters. Final line hum rises without overwriting; image propels rather than stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Metaphors are fresh—“time slipped through fingers like sand turned to silk”—and never stall momentum. Rhythm accelerates into the final surge. No loops, no filter-verb clutter. Clean mechanics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrasing (“unfinished symphonies”) is voice-motivated and pattern-consistent. One paraphrase loop (“tending… warmly attentive”) repeats across two adjacent sentences—minor, not closure-touching. Otherwise high density and clarity hold.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry dual duty—description seeds next action; props track cleanly. Figurative language is spare, purposeful (“veins of quartz pulsing,” “web that pulsed with shared vitality”). No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional modifier stacks (“callused yet gently systematic”) stay in-character. Final paragraph cadence modulates to quiet uplift, sealing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with purposeful repetition of “bronze,” “dust,” and “pulse.” Minor loop—“luminous skeptic” twice in two sentences—doesn’t dull momentum. Metaphors (tower as beacon, amber as echo) are coherent and grounded. No line-level artifacts touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or stakes. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—coral bones, volcanic dust—without mixed-metaphor clutter. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line whistles cost back into air. High density achieved through noun-verb specificity (“wheels crunch over shells,” “dust spilled”) rather than modifier pile-up.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory detail and stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“bent fender curved like a lover’s sigh”) are precise and character-rooted. Final paragraph maintains rhythmic control without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean, propulsive; each sentence advances goal or atmosphere; no looped scaffolding; final image of silhouette dissolving feeds back with visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; sentences layer goal, texture, and stakes simultaneously (“ice crystals suspended like wary eyes”). Figurative vehicles stay coherent—cold, sharp, celestial—and avoid purple overload. Occasional template stems (“piece by piece,” “one by one”) create faint drumbeat but do not stall momentum or cloud closure. No paraphrase loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffolding artifacts in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is tight and textured—no loops, no synonym churn. Figurative density is intentional (luminous absence, ebony and ivory relic) and charges closure. Sentence rhythm accelerates toward the unbinding without muddle. Only minor overwrites: “nomadic penumbra” verges on purple. Information density high; lines do two jobs each.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive—no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“thunder grumbled distantly, hidden in the mountain’s belly”) is precise, never muddled, and accelerates toward the charged final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is sparse and exact: “veins of a silver leaf” for corridors, “threads binding the world” for silence. Sentences vary in length to match tension; short beats accelerate during maze turns. No filter-verb stacks or purple patches. Final line lands with crystallized cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to fragment bursts as crowd poems layer; metaphors stay consistent (light/prism/bone) with only one risk—“forged hush” repeats three times but is pattern-taught. High density—e.g., “refracted the action through verse, each line a facet…”—advances all three vectors (character, setting, theme) simultaneously. No scaffold, no mixed vehicles; a hairline slip from absolute polish.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, each sentence advancing image or pressure; no loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift, and the final line’s cadence mirrors the workshop’s settling sway.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean and rhythmic; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (e.g., “fishing boats bobbed like forgotten dreams”) are sparse and purposeful. Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses as the light fades. Occasional elevated phrasing (“pocket of eternity”) risks purple but is balanced by grounded detail.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet purposeful; each sentence layers scent, light, or motion. Occasional stacked metaphors (“sapphire blade,” “velvet hours”) flirt with excess but are anchored in Elias’s heightened perception. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph tightens into crystalline image.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with the gibbous moon, then exhales under the crescent, mirroring Elias’s clarity flux.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, propulsive, and mostly free of scaffold; tiny loops in “storm-sharpened limbs and relentless gales” could tighten, but do not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm shows purposeful cadence; sentence lengths vary to match fog-slowed observation. Metaphors occasionally stack (“mist that clung like a lover’s regret”) yet stay physically coherent and halt before the climax beat. Zero paraphrase loops; pronouns and props track cleanly. One mixed vehicle (“flower’s purity mocking his solitude”) mildly blurs agency but doesn’t cloud causality.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences do two jobs (“The cavern thrummed at midsummer…”). Figurative layer is restrained until the vision paragraph, where soft personification (“petals unfurling like secrets”) is earned. One paraphrase loop: “rising… rose… rising” across two adjacent clauses; minor. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, propulsive. Filter-verb count low; strong verbs dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentences do dual work. Mixed metaphors avoided; “starlight bleeding” sustains. One scaffold paraphrase (“the climb a test of will against the mountain’s unyielding spine”) could compress. Filter verbs minimal. Rhythm modulates with altitude, breathes at ledge, accelerates into cavern—controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythmic propulsion carries long yet breathable sentences; only one paraphrase loop (“resolve’s palette colored their path ahead” echoes earlier palette line) costs −0.2. Figurative layering is high but patterned—light/fire/shell spiral—teaching its recursion early, paying off in the closing hum. No register drift or mixed metaphor; closure image remains crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong verbs, sensory economy; occasional modifier stacks (“raw, untamed yearning”) flirt with overwrite but peak beat at scroll-rolling stays clean. No loops, coherent spatial tracking; readable aloud without stumbling.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, tracking fog-thick hesitation then release. Figurative language appears sparingly and purposefully (“time flowed not in ticks but in steady, veiled drips”), never clogging beats. No synonym loops or paraphrase stacks; each clause advances image or emotion. One micro-copy slip—“mapping the emotional terrain” repeats prompt phrasing—stops just short of the closure beat, allowing high band.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent—“lightning forked like angry veins”—and never muddle causality. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer breaths in calm, clipped fragments during inscription. High information density without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Occasional overwritten peaks—“ethereal grit that clung…like urban fog” stacked with “shimmering elixir”—but density never stalls beats. No paraphrase loops; pronouns clean; opening and closing lines anchor and resolve. Two mixed metaphors (“notes on a staff, branching like trees”) mildly strain logic yet occur mid-scene, not at closure. Minor scaffolds (−0.2) keep it under the 9+ ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is dense yet fluid; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. A few near-repetitions (“resounding hush,” “humble object”) are minor and do not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and sensorily precise; no loops or scaffold. Occasional lyrical compression (“quiet wildfire”) is earned and pattern-consistent. No artifacts in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences layer sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Minor loop: “clover melancholy” appears three times in close succession, a hairline slip. Otherwise zero scaffold or mixed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, rhythms mirroring the tunnel’s pulse. Occasional lyrical flourish (“ghosts whispering secrets of separation”) stays within POV lexicon. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    Almost no loops; lush figurative language is pattern-taught and paid off; one minor filter-verb stack at the jetty edge keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose propels—compressed syntax under pressure, no loops, vivid selective sensory detail integrated into action. Final ivy image is cleanly crystallized.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; no template cadence detected. Information density high—single sentences deliver sensory data, emotional charge, and world rule. Metaphors stay consistent with sonic geography; no mixed vehicles. One scaffold pair spotted—“hidden depths now charted within” slightly paraphrases prior clause, but does not touch closure beat, so −0.2 only. Grammar, pronouns, tense clean.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense but controlled—most sentences advance image, emotion, and world-rule simultaneously. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “minutes stretch or snap like brittle bones” is singular, visceral, apt. Occasional scaffold (“she began editing, her motivation sharpening…”) could be trimmed, yet loops do not pervade the final third. Strong paragraph variety and tactile verbs keep momentum aloft in zero-g.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong rhythmic variation and high-density lines (“joy bubbled in Elias’s chest, a sorrowful delight”) advance triple duty. Two adjacent near-repeats (“luminous harbor by moonlight shimmered...”) mildly loop; figurative language stays coherent and propulsive, never clogging the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    Most sentences perform double duty (action + atmosphere). Recurrent “volcanic tenderness” becomes loop-scaffold; three appearances in 750 words dulls edge. Metaphors generally coherent; no contradicted vehicles. Strong verb choice—“traced,” “bled,” “pulsed.” One paraphrase loop: “hidden beneath desert sands... buried this place in a cataclysm of ash” repeats burial idea in same sentence. Otherwise lean.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves the sonic motif without clutter. Rhythm mirrors the drumbeats—long rolling sentences swell, then fragment under stress. No loops or mixed metaphors; final image is crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, high-density: stacked containers “snared the unwary” marries hazard to POV judgment in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles (rusted monoliths, secret current) stay consistent. Occasional elevated clause (“calculated spontaneity”) edges toward register drift but doesn’t stall momentum or obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean yet textured; sentences vary in length and avoid loops. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “darkness that had swallowed the light” edges toward cliché but is isolated.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Metaphors are fresh—“walls shimmered like deep ocean veins”—and physically coherent. No loops, no scaffold; paragraph cuts are surgical. Rhythm accelerates with stakes, then settles into the final hush without slackening.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm alternates long rolling cadences (swell imagery) with clipped fragments when the bone brands her palm, propulsion matching physical stress. Figurative layer is selective—three extended metaphors total—and each recurs (whisper-secrets, scattered stars, rusted locks) to build pattern rather than clutter. No scaffold or synonym churn; every noun earns specificity (“pebbled shore,” “crystalline pool”). Tiny register lift (“conceptual repricing”) appears only in this rubric, not the story text, so no penalty applies. The prose is clean enough for immediate copy-edit, landing just outside 9+ because one clause (“unlocking her guarded heart with visions”) nudges summary at the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric clauses build hum, then short splash as foot breaks ice. Information dual-loaded (“her cloak trailing shadows that danced across the quartz pillars”). No scaffold loops; each sentence adds sensory shift. Minor purple tendency (“cobalt atrium shimmered in hues of deep, electric blue”) but does not occlude causal line.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong noun-verb economy; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). Figurative control keeps metaphor consistent with heat/light/glass scheme. One paraphrase loop detected (“glass sculptures caught…/glass sculptures sing”) and a mild filter-verb cluster, but artifacts do not touch the closing cadence, so 8+ stands. Final sentence lands on image, not exposition, satisfying read-aloud test.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with bell pulses; stacked metaphors occasionally clump (“velvet against the soul,” “carbide flicker that amplified doubt into probing melody”) but never obscure causality; one paraphrase loop—“texture of connection” reiterated without new charge—subtracts modest propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with purposeful repetition of “wilt/wither/bloom” that accumulates meaning. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “grief-worn skin” and “shadowed cameos” verge on stock. Final image crystallizes without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “she sought to map the cultural patterns emerging from the ruins.” No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are fresh—“virtual dust,” “cultural weaves.” Sentence variety supports cadence. Clean mechanics; no artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong nouns and verbs carry load; minimal scaffold. Occasional modifier stacks (“bruised purples and golds,” “bittersweet tang”) flirt with purple but stay tied to POV. No loops or paraphrase beats. One mixed vehicle: “torrent of light and shadow” floods mind—cliché cluster that dulls the climactic line.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; metaphors (“clouds billowed like pages”) are precise and never muddle causality. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure; zero loops or filler.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is fluid and generally concise; metaphor density is high but patterned to the nocturnal mood. Minor scaffold appears (“layer by layer,” “one layer at a time”) and one paraphrase loop (“fragile convictions… now gleamed with renewed purpose”) withholds full 9-band clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, rhythm echoing breath of sedation clearing. No loops or scaffold; each line advances image or choice. Figurative language sparse, precise: “roots through cracked soil” carries both telepathy and grief. High density: hourglass, coffee rings, and scar converge in one tactile beat without crowding.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“hushed thunder” threads through beginning and end). No loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction fits the lyric register without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm swells and ebbs; sentences open varied. Two adjacent near-repeats (“stardust woven… stardust reformed”) create minor paraphrase loop; figurative chain stays coherent, but density peaks mid-scene without payoff differentiation, costing full precision. Otherwise clean grammar, strong verbs, no scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry dual duty—image + stakes—without synonym churn. Three metaphors in tight sequence appear only once in the climax and serve the pattern, escaping density penalty. No loops or template cadence; each verb is concrete (“coaxed,” “brushing,” “swallowed”). Opening and closing lines bookend with tonal echo, satisfying rhythm test.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong noun-verb pairs and selective metaphor keep density high; only rare loop (“whispers that carried truths,” “whispering elms”) repeats sensory root. Hydraulic/organic hybrids stay coherent. One mixed moment—“thoughts cascading like waterfalls over pistons”—compresses two vehicles but doesn’t stall climax. Otherwise clean, rhythmic, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong rhythmic control and varied sentence openings; occasional metaphor clusters (“veiled ridgeway…forgotten dreams…rocky spine”) flirt with overwriting but never stall causality. Zero paraphrase loops or filter stacks; final punch line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    High-density lines—“fortress’s frostbitten hope crystallized”—advance both atmosphere and concept. Rhythm varies; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay consistent to cold/music axis; no mixed vehicles. Clean grammar; opening and closing images form bookends without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, and largely loop-free; figurative language (ink as “captured night”) is sparse and purposeful. Occasional faint template cadence (“across the pause of shifting constellations” repeated) but not clustered in peak beats. Strong information density—each sentence layers image or mythic logic. Grammar and tense immaculate; closure line cleanly resolves without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo—lofted clauses under daylight, staccato taps at nightfall. Figurative layer is restrained; mixed-metaphor risk appears once (“orange veins across the water”) but does not tangle causality. Scaffolding is minimal—no paraphrase loops, only purposeful reiteration of “moored” and “periodic” to teach pattern. Information density stays high: each overlay action also tags emotional charge. A lone typo-risk comma splice after “recalibrating narrative” is tolerable at this band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but disciplined; rhythm accelerates with the hum’s crescendo. Occasional purple tints (“thunderous serenity,” “velvet expanse”) risk density but serve atmospheric pressure. No loops or paraphrase clutter. Strong verbs—“sift,” “magnify,” “reignite”—propel momentum. Final line is crisp, recharging “thunderous serenity” with new menace.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences carry double duty—action, sensory filter, and world rule—keeping density high. Figurative language is selective; no mixed-metaphor clusters impede clarity. One paraphrase loop appears: “reconstruction efforts unfolded…reconstruction sites,” a minor scaffold. Otherwise propulsion is clean, with strong verbs and no filter-verb stacks in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with purposeful repetition (“pearl of stillness”) that accrues meaning. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she recalled how…”) and one mixed metaphor (“shrapnel like confetti from hell”) keep it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “salt-crusted windows let in slivers of moonlight” does triple sensory work. Rhythm modulates from languid to staccato as pressure rises. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. One near-cliché (“hollowed by regret”) is forgiven for its precise placement in a cracked mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“ink seeping in ephemeral patterns that twisted like living script.” No loops or scaffold; “wind-carved,” “bone-like,” “bleached sand” are reused with purpose. Final line’s cadence—“ultimately, in that ephemeral veil, Elara uncovered the why”—delivers closure without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density with zero loops: each sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Metaphors are precise (“time fractured into a whirlwind of memory”) and never muddle causality. Rhythm accelerates with the upload sequence, then settles into the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies, information-dense; only minor scaffold (“she rose… she knelt…”) and one mixed metaphor (“flames frozen”). Hooks open and close well; no artifact touches the final embedding beat.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Density is high—lines carry metaphor, action, and sensory data simultaneously—yet figurative vehicles never collide: bass-vines, petal-treble, ink-trails all obey the garden’s sonic physics. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for the cast, staccato fragments when bursts of feral sound erupt. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; each sentence advances image or pressure. One near-misstep—“patterns twisted their ancient formations into fractals of forgotten light” edges purple, but the fractal image recurs at closure, earning its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.0)
    Strong nouns/verbs (“silver sentinel,” “winking lens”) and varied rhythm carry momentum. A few stacked metaphors in the opening dusk paragraph flirt with overwriting but don’t stall beats. No loops or synonym churn; pronouns track cleanly. Final clause “truths unveiled in starlit clarity” edges generic, blunting closure punch.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, precise imagery (“amber warm as skin”), and syntactic variety that mirrors emotion under pressure. High-density prose advances story without figurative clutter or scaffold; final metaphor legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense; mixed metaphors are few and minor. Occasional loop near-paraphrase (“whispering…whispers”) drags slightly, and lilac over-saturation risks perfume overload, but rhythm breathes with scene needs. Errors never obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid mechanical patterns. High density—single sentences fold image, memory, and bodily action (“Her fingers lingered on the irregularities that formed an ancient script”). One paraphrase loop—“warm coldness” repeated three times—deducts 0.3; otherwise zero scaffold. Mixed metaphor check: “arms of steel” beside “breeze through thorns” reads as intentional contradiction rather than muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.1)
    Most sentences carry double duty (sense + motion + backstory). Occasional perfume/taste pairing risks minor metaphor stack but stops short of clutter. No scaffold loops; pronoun tracking clean. One strained simultaneity: “As they moved together, her steps mirroring his...” could split for sequence clarity. Overall propulsion survives, closure image unmarred.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances light, skin, or emotion. Metaphors are coherent—geode as lens, static as spark—never mixed. High-density lines (“trails of colored LEDs danced across canvas like fireflies in a jar”) compress scene, mood, and stakes in one image. No scaffold, no filter-verb clusters, closure image left clean.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “the heat-map bloomed, revealing not just past emotions but projections” compresses time, emotion, and stakes into one clause. No loops, no mixed metaphors; cadence quickens with the tidal pulse, then exhales into the final heraldic line.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no loops or scaffold detected. Occasional elevated diction (“predestined paths,” “disseminated like echoes”) fits the mythic register without drifting into purple. High information density: each button’s hue carries cultural shorthand. Metaphors stay coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“mist clung like forgotten whispers”) is purposeful and paid off in the final lattice. Sentence variety mirrors emotional ebb and surge.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language (“spindrift serenity,” “palimpsest promise”) is patterned and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Final paragraph cadence mirrors the calm after crossing, reinforcing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line craft is lean and rhythmic; mixed metaphor rare, no synonym loops. One minor scaffold: “sharp gentleness” repeated as label rather than evolving image. Final sentences carry dual duty—closure plus cadence—propelling exit. High density achieved; artifact-free enough for elite tier, if not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean and sensorily dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“unraveling of the protected vulnerability”) skirts purple but remains tethered to Elara’s heightened moment.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    Vivid, selective sensory detail; no loops or scaffold; high information density, final image charges without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm modulates; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Figurative layering is dense but patterned early (“spiral’s curves evoking loops of handwriting”) and pays off at closure, avoiding purple overload. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn detected. One strained metaphor margin: “lilies themselves conspired in gentle jests” momentarily anthropomorphizes flora without agency, but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty: atmosphere, tech specificity, plot advance (“These aren’t gifts, Harlan,” she said softly, sliding an astronomical chart…). Metaphors stay coherent—veil cracking like brittle ice—without purple overload. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph pivots choice or stakes. Minor rhythm hiccup: two consecutive “as” constructions dilute propulsion slightly, but the final third remains clean, keeping the closure image sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors of veins, lovers, and vises serve pressure without clutter. Only a single mixed echo—“lover’s embrace turned vise”—momentarily muddles the physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, though “lance” metaphor risks mild overwriting. No loops or scaffold; minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrase but does not cloud closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary; high-density lines (“hum of failing generators underscoring dread”) advance multiple jobs. Metaphors stay coherent—“barnacle on dying whale” sets fragility tone. Occasional adjective stacks (“jagged permanence”) flirt with excess but peak beat clarity intact; no loops or scaffolds dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud cadence breathes with action; sentence openings vary, no template runs. Figurative language is disciplined—one controlling metaphor of bridging sustained. High info density: “pixelated amnesty” packs forgiveness, tech age, and granular imagery in two words. Minor repeat—“luminous disbelief” used twice—doesn’t stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-describes (three figurative phrases within four sentences on first rival sighting); small loop penalty for “rust-red vines” followed by “rust-flecked paint.” Otherwise clear propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence variety is strong; stacked metaphors in dream sequence flirt with purple but stay coherent under Accumulative lens. No paraphrase loops or template cadences detected. Occasional elevated latinate diction (“crystallized final moment”) momentarily lifts POV above prior texture, but lapse is brief. Closure image “daylily’s petals seemed to stir” is precise, unscaffolded, and lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with purposeful repetition (“unbend” refrain) and no paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated diction (“petrified mid-penstroke”) fits the mythic register without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; density high; metaphors braid roots/time without clutter; final shining scar image crystallizes with rhythmic cadence and no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose carries rhythm: creaky chair / metallic tang / swallowing sun—three hard stresses that echo quarry clang. Few adjectives, strong nouns and verbs (“slumped,” “sifting,” “pocketed”) keep momentum. One scaffold spotted: “the longing swell, a valley-wide echo of yearning” compresses two near-syn metaphors, but the beat is brief and doesn’t recur. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; information density stays high. Clean copy apart from one comma splice mid-paragraph 3.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density, zero loops, and purposeful metaphor (“magnetic hum a lonely pulse”) accelerate the beat. No overwriting; each sentence advances character, image, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative layering (“symphony of brass cogs,” “narrative nectar”) serves the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold, though occasional modifiers flirt with excess.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lyrical but disciplined: no mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops, strong verbs carry weight. Occasional elevated phrasing (“resonant hush,” “drips echoed like forgotten whispers”) flirts with purple yet stays pattern-taught and pays off in the final hush. One paraphrase loop (“abandoned hopes” twice in four lines) costs a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong read-aloud cadence and sentence variety; most lines carry dual duty (action + atmosphere). Over-figurative patches (“veins of green blood,” “skeletal relic”) cluster in early description without pattern payoff; one paraphrase loop (“daringly methodical” repeated twice in close succession) clips momentum. Otherwise clean, no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong rhythmic variety; sentences advance multiple jobs (image + motion + stakes). Occasional overwrought flourish (“mist curling around her like a protective shroud”) but beat remains clear. No loops, paraphrase, or scaffold. Punctuation clean; metaphors coherent. One mixed vehicle (“petals of a nocturnal flower” beside clockwork cipher) barely dents clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is charged and selective yet occasionally drifts into decorative density (three stacked metaphors in one high-pressure beat). Loop screen finds no redundant phrasing; rhythm modulates pressure. One filter-verb cluster near the end triggers minor clarity drag.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from orotund openings to staccato final clause, propelling the last breath. Figurative vehicles stay consistent—aurora as weave, chip as ember—no mixed metaphors. Information density high: single sentence often layers tool, memory, and bodily change. Minor scaffold: “luminous quartz that hummed with captured starlight” echoes prior “grotto’s walls…hummed”; trims would raise to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies, sentences carry double duty; some lush clusters (“vineyard hush of ripened secrets”) ride the edge of purple but pattern is taught and paid off. No loops, no mixed metaphors, pronouns clean; minor scaffold in “scalloping the edges of those pools had been her ritual” could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is rhythmically varied, sentences breathe with gusts. No loops or scaffold; “cloak of doubt” repetition is the only near-loop, but it serves as motif anchor. Figurative load is high yet coherent—wind-chimes as “whispers from the ether” stays within lighthouse logic. Strong verbs (“clinking,” “tugging”) keep propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet audible; metaphors consistently invoke dissolution/reform, reinforcing theme without mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated phrase (“celestial glow filtering through the ripples like veiled starlight”) borders on decorative but arrives during lull, not high-stakes beat, so momentum survives. No synonym churn or scaffold loops detected; sentence openings vary. One paraphrase echo: “hush” thrice; minimal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Every sentence carries dual freight—image and motion—without loops; “shadows danced across the bone spires, mimicking the arrowhead’s etchings” fuses setting, object, and fate in one breath.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked modifiers (“crystalline filigrees across every surface”) risk overwriting but never stall momentum. No loops or paraphrase artifacts intrude on the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; sentences layer sensory data without redundancy. Strong verbs (“waded,” “loomed,” “sighed open”) propel momentum. Minor loop: “lanterns” appears three times in two adjacent clauses during the release. Otherwise clean, with no artifacts touching the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, character, and theme. No loops or scaffold; “coins clinking like distant echoes” and “thread pulsed with frequencies” are precise, non-generic metaphors. Syntax varies naturally, accelerating during bursts, slowing during reflection. Minor elevated diction (“wavelength align”) is voice-motivated and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences vary in length and stress, accelerating during crystallization then settling into the final beacon image. No loops, no mixed metaphors; each figurative turn serves the emotional arc. High information density—“inked beasts coiling from abyssal depths” does triple duty as setting, character, and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, setting, or causality. Metaphors (“dying embers,” “salt-crusted bones”) are precise and earned. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short beats during drip timing, longer cadences for reflection. Zero loops or scaffold; no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lucid, rhythmic, and propulsive—no loops or filters muddle peak beats. Figurative language is selective and purposeful; final image lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful. One minor mixed metaphor—“liquid prisms” momentarily jars—does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; only minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt the burden deepen”) and one paraphrase loop (“soundless echo” thrice) keep it from 9.0. Metaphors are coherent and serve pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    High-density lines (“Nutrient fluid spilled in slow-motion arcs, defying the dojo's gravity”) do triple duty: image, rule cue, emotional beat. Rhythm accelerates with parataxis during merge, then exhales into longer sentence at twin’s first breath—precise sonic shape. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles (rift-shards, crystalline edge) stay consistent with world logic. One stray adjective “relentless” for winds is the single filler word in 760-word piece.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lush but purposeful description; some modifier stacks (“storm-born silence… velvet sky”) verge on purple yet pattern-taught early. No loops or scaffold; information density high. One mixed cue: “orthogonal approaches” appears thrice with slightly different gloss—minor register drift, not closure-touching.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences are dense and propulsive, each doing at least two jobs—advancing action, layering sensory detail, or deepening theme. Occasional stacked metaphors (“ghostly chorus,” “fleeting sculptures of joy”) risk overwriting but are reined in by the physicality of the cord pulls and engine noise. No loops or paraphrase drift; the final line crystallizes without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language serves pattern (“thorns etched,” “lanterns in the haze”) without overwriting. No loops or scaffold. One strained metaphor—“roots into the void”—barely grazes clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose score high but capped at 8.0 by density cluster: four metaphor-rich sentences in the climax (“thawing ice,” “crackled inner light,” “vines unfurling,” “frozen bloom thawing”) slightly overload the decisive beat. Otherwise no loops, no scaffold, strong verbs, varied paragraph lengths. Mercury-sapphire drop is precise; opening line anchors stakes; closing image crystallizes. Minor elision of intermediate melt times is strategic.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences carry dual duty (action + atmosphere) with few throwaway openers. Occasional elevated flourish—“a storm held in perfect stasis”—but figurative density stays purposeful, taught early, and returns in closure. No loops or synonym churn. Clean mechanics; only micro-tighten “quietest finale hid the seed of renewal” to remove stock seed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense; figurative language is selective, though “stars like forgotten promises” flirts with cliché. No loops or scaffold; transitions are crisp. One mixed metaphor—“jaws of jagged rock… illuminated by starlight filtering through impossible fissures”—momentarily muddles scale.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence variety and information density are high; each line advances illusion-craft or memory bleed. Figurative language is controlled—one sustained sinew metaphor—avoiding purple overload. Minor scaffold: “fever dream architect” label repeated twice could trim once. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Final image is uncluttered, letting the cracked lattice land.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; occasional poetic layering (“kelp in a tide”) is purposeful and never clogs causality. No loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense: one sentence slips three senses plus plot gear (“cool metal of her tools”) without clog. Metaphors stay coherent (whispers→shadows→pulse) and avoid mixed vehicles. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; each paragraph advances knowledge or pressure. The single hedge preventing 9+ is occasional double adjective padding (“bruised purples and grays”) that could compress further.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet clear: “gold flecks catching his light like stars in ink” does triple duty—image, character awe, foreshadowing. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative language is controlled, never muddling causality.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“spilled ink bloomed…whispers from the void”). Metaphors are coherent and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates during the ritual, then exhales into the final steady count. No overwriting in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers sound, texture, and motion. No loops or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with the flock’s spiral, then settles into the final sustained chord.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic; a few stacked metaphors verge on purple but serve the fairy-tale tone. No loops or scaffold; clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence variety and information density are high; figurative language is patterned (music = pulse) and rarely over-clustered. Minor scaffold: “resonantly soft” is repeated four times with overlapping adverbs, creating a template echo that slightly dulls the finale. Otherwise clean, no mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is vivid, compressed, and propulsive; zero loops or scaffold; figurative language serves the climactic lift-off beat.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with only minor paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere, and no line-level artifacts intrude on the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rich sensory density balanced with compression; rhythmic control tightens in the scarf-reawakening beat. Minor filter-verb clusters and occasional “equation-danced” figurative layering dull immediety but don’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    High-density lines carry double duty: “palette returning to stillness” compresses color fade and emotional quiet. Metaphors stay coherent—light as brushstroke, absence as pigment. One paraphrase loop (“luminous absence” echoed three times in final third) but does not touch closure beat. No scaffold, clean grammar, tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dense, vivid, propulsive prose; no loops or filler. Metaphor use is limited, pattern-taught, and resolved at closure (starlight lock → ribbon knot).

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined; occasional stacked metaphors (“spectral blooms,” “ethereal glow”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum. No loops or artifacts in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.4)
    Sentences perform double duty (action + atmosphere) without scaffold; no synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent—shadow, swing, glass, tea spirals interlock under geometry motif. Strong verbs (“snagged,” “scraping,” “loosening”) replace modifiers. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses during bump-lectern beat, then exhales at final line. Clean grammar and pronoun tracking across two-character scene.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with minimal scaffolding; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are coherent and grounded in horticultural lexicon. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Occasional elevated diction (“ethereal domains”) fits the lyric register without register drift. Final line crystallizes momentum cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “salt-stiffened and dark with age, parted slowly” shows fiber resistance while implying time. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and tested (“fractured memories” pays off when masks re-form). Opening and closing lines book-end with light imagery, creating cadence frame. A single filter verb cluster (“she felt the weight”) is justified by the intangible nature of the hush; it does not dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “jaggedly, dividing the known landscapes from an uncharted void” packs map, emotion, and stakes in one clause. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“visual poetry of wind-swept grass”—never muddling causality. Final sentence lands clean without ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with dive-tempo: clauses lengthen during descent, shorten during salvage, final line quiet. Figurative density is high but patterned (water, stars, static) and pays off. One paraphrase loop noted; no mixed metaphors. Strong verbs (“crackling,” “teased,” “hummed”) propel. Line-level artifacts do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; “flickering lines of code that danced like fireflies” is the only simile and it lands. Rhythm accelerates with the storm: longer clauses yield to staccato strokes as she paints. Zero grammar slips, precise punctuation, and strong verbs (“surge,” “merge,” “swell”) keep momentum high.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined: information doubles (light refracts / diary decrypts) without paraphrase loops. Occasional soft abstracts—“joy bubbling beneath the lines”—slip in under accumulative license and don’t stall closure. Rhythm breathes with floor-ding cadence, propelling upward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; high information density—each cloud label does double duty as emotion and atmosphere. Minor scaffold: “quietly explosive tension” is repeated near-identically twice; a small paraphrase loop around “spooled wholeness” costs immediacy. Otherwise clean, vivid, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Density high: pigment unpacking, coin trace, safe groan each do double duty for atmosphere and cause. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for hush, staccato for rumble. Only micro-loop: “fractally precise” appears four times; slight redundancy but taught as motif and repaid in final mural. No mixed metaphor; tactile verbs (“kneeling,” “pried,” “slipped”) keep propulsion forward.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: each metaphor (living inkblots, hidden veins) advances the map motif. Occasional stacked modifiers—“sociable isolation,” “forgotten storage hold”—slow momentum; paraphrase loops absent.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid, rhythmic, syntactically varied. Frozen imagery clusters but serves pressure (“mirrors shuddered, their hauntingly bright glow shifting”). A few boilerplate phrases (“soft hush of distant morning,” “weight of forgotten years”) slightly dilute density—nonetheless, high information-per-line. No loops or scaffold; each metaphor advances stakes or mood. Read-aloud ear strong.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean, kinetic sentences without loops or scaffold; one “luminous veins” metaphor feels slightly decorative amid high-pressure beats, yet rhythm stays purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences perform multiple jobs without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—nested waves, pane of hush—though “bruised” modifiers risk over-patterning. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph achieves charged poise through rhythmic crescendo and hush.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose has vivid, economical specificity; zero loops or scaffold. One metaphor string too dense in the orchard whisper section, but rhythmic control under pressure remains strong and aids momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is largely clean: concrete nouns, active verbs, selective sensory cues. One paraphrase loop (“separations were temporary, like the river's braids, destined to weave back together”) repeats the already-shown foam image; no mixed metaphors or scaffolding beyond that. Closing sentence is crisp, letting “symphony of second chances” stand without further explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose carries high density: each sentence advances tally, atmosphere, or stakes without scaffold. Figurative vehicles stay consistent—light as parole, absence as material—avoiding mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrasing (“integrated fragmentation,” “conceptual repricing”) is pattern-taught early and pays off, so register drift is waived. No paraphrase loops or filler; final paragraph lands with crisp, resonant brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—e.g., “faint glow of rainwater pooling…mirroring the starlit sky” supplies setting, mood, and stakes in fifteen words. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; vehicles consistent (sand, frost, broth). One filter-verb cluster (“she felt…she saw…”) appears mid-story but occurs outside the peak beat, so −0.3 only. Closure line is crisp, image-driven, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses like breathing: long anaphoric sentences under starlight tighten into staccato exchanges at the elevator. Density is high—single verbs carry twin sensory/causal loads (“oiled the gears, humming”). Zero paraphrase loops; only one mixed metaphor (“grain...starved of connection”) but it passes POV filter. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is selective—moonlight “silvered the rocks,” synapses fire “like lightning”—and avoids purple overload. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Minor elevated diction (“quaking reverie”) is voice-motivated and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Figurative strings frequent but purposeful; occasional twin metaphors (“fractured knowledge into rainbows…hidden spectra”) slightly blur. No loops, tenses clean; final line “fire within burned brighter” is earned callback, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. Metaphors are precise—“stress cracks spiderwebbing like forgotten sheet music.” No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates with the strum, then exhales. Only micro-slip: one mixed metaphor (“bridge for unseen energies”) that still reads legible.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with tension; language dense with information but no loops, metaphors crisp (dent/bishop diagonal); final line crystallized without figurative choke.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentences vary in length and opening. Dense metaphor clusters in early description flirt with overwriting but pattern is taught and thins under pressure. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase stacks; pronoun and action order clean. High-band gate missed only because figurative language remains thick relative to slim beat count.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“reek of decay,” “fertile decay birthing life.” Metaphors are coherent and grounded. Sentence rhythm mirrors breathing: swelling descriptions, then clipped gasps under stench. No artifacts in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful. High information density without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, propulsive; no loops or mixed metaphors. “Fog thickening the air” and “wind bent like a blade” are precise, earned. No artifacts in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is bell-varied; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Figurative strings remain coherent under the chromatic system—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often carries light, sound, and emotional valence. Minor scaffold: “oscillating repose” is repeated without new incremental charge, a hairline slip that keeps the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm accelerates through flute trial; metaphors are selective and purposeful. Zero loops, no purple muddle; read-aloud cadence matches stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet clear, rhythm modulating with pressure. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful (“stars…like secrets unwilling to be told”) and never muddles causality. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm, accelerating during the pendant’s hum and easing into dawn; no loops or mixed metaphors, and “coax wonder from the routine” is earned by scene rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean and textured, with purposeful repetition (“mist,” “prism,” “frost”) that accumulates meaning. One mixed metaphor (“wept quartz tears”) is minor; no loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense; metaphoric tendrils (“threads pulling loose from time’s unraveling tapestry”) recur with purpose, culminating in the literal act. Occasional near-abstract strings—“latent sacrifice,” “raveling silence”—risk register drift but are grounded by physical handling of thread and bead. No loops or paraphrase stacks; final paragraph lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    High information density, no loops; figurative language kept selective, never obscures cause/effect; sentence-level propulsion matches scene urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are lean, salt-crusted, and propulsive; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Occasional slight echo (“luminescent yet sorrowful, like sunlight piercing fog”) is the only minor scaffold, and it lands early enough not to dull the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; clauses mirror tidal rise/fall. Dense metaphor is purposeful—storm-herald’s worldview—yet occasional stacks (“verdant promise against the encroaching void”) flirt with purple without muddling causality. No loops or paraphrase detected; pronoun/tense clean. One strained phrase—“laughter bubbled up, a shadowed elation that masked the sorrow”—leans abstract, holding score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.7)
    High figurative density risks purple overload (“liquid fire,” “valley-mist wonder”) yet stays tethered to POV craft. No loops or scaffold; information is layered economically. One mixed vehicle—“clouds clung like forgotten dreams”—is soft but does not obscure causality or dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with only minor loops (“moonlight… moonlight”); figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. Final third is clean, allowing the closure image to land unimpeded.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic—“distilling elixirs from dreams and regrets”—but occasional stacked metaphors (“silken fire,” “frozen wave”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; momentum holds. Final line crystallizes without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dense, purposeful prose; zero loops, vivid paradox metaphors read clean; few filter verbs and strong sentence propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean and textured: “vines receded slightly under her care” and “steam curling like secrets” advance both image and character. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“heuristically gentle”) is voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; sentences vary in length and opening. Some metaphor density in paragraphs 2–3 flirts with purple but pattern is taught early and paid off in “quartz hush” finale. Zero loops, no synonym churn, pronouns clean. Occasional elevated participle openers slightly dilute urgency mid-scene, preventing full 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; occasional template cadence (“she retreated… she initiated”) flattens a beat. No overwriting or mixed metaphors in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional stacked metaphors (“veins held comet trails”) flirt with excess but never obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers sensory detail, interiority, and forward motion. Metaphors are coherent—“auroral sorrow” threads light and grief without contradiction. No loops or scaffold. Minor filter verb in “he recalled” is voice-motivated and brief. Final cadence mirrors the opening, creating a satisfying echo.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences perform double duty (action + world). No scaffold loops; mixed metaphors absent. High information density yet clarity maintained. Only micro-overwrite: “desiccated skins of forgotten fruits” slightly strains visual coherence in already humid space—minor.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm modulates well, sentences breathe with the wind crescendo; most clauses perform double duty. A few adjacent near-paraphrases (“symphonies of truth,” “melodies that peeled back illusions”) and stacked metaphors in one high-pressure beat slightly dull propulsion, but no artifact obscures causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (rust-nostalgia, thorn-static) are precise and internally consistent. Rhythm accelerates during burns, then settles into calm hum—tight control without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet textured; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“breadcrumbs in the sand”—is minor and early, not near closure. Strong verb choices (“spill,” “swallow,” “gilded”) propel without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (spider, kelp, web) recur with purpose, never muddled. Sentence variety supports the cadence of dance and code.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive—no loops or scaffold. One filter-verb stack (“the gleaming silence that followed”) is brief; metaphorical vehicles stay coherent. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during the dig scene and then crystallizes in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush yet precise—high density, no loops. Rhythmic variation with sentence openings propels ritual beats. Figurative language restrained; when used (moonlight spirits) it charges image, not blur. Clean copy, no scaffold sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers atmosphere or advances relationship. Occasional lyrical excess (“steam from Earl Grey mingled with the scent of aged books and wax”) is purposeful and patterned. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Metaphors are coherent—building as archive, seal as covenant. Final paragraph achieves charged poise without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense; most sentences perform double duty (atmosphere + causality). Figurative layering risks purple in clusters ("velvet garden," "forgotten veils," "tragically radiant") but the pattern is taught early and paid off at closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor scaffold: "quarantined memories" is repeated four times in close proximity; tightening one instance would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or ritual. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“stalactites dripped like hesitant heartbeats,” “pearl twilight of her soul’s quiet dawn.” No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the aurora’s pulse, closing the sonic pattern without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong rhythmic ear and high information density, yet metaphor strings crowd peak beats—“veins of the earth,” “reed-blown melancholy,” “cosmic hum”—blurring causality in the climax. two paraphrase loops (“echoed endlessly… echo’s origin”) dull propulsion; trimming would sharpen the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense but not purple; each sentence adds image or knowledge. Occasional poetic stacking (“borrowed starlight filtered through fractured ice like whispers”) risks loitering, yet the rhythm always snaps forward. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors obscure causality or dull the final flake.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.7)
    Figurative density is high but patterned early (nets, weaves, lights) and pays off at firefly convergence; mixed metaphors absent. Occasional elevated Latinate clusters (“scintillatingly somber,” “conceptual repricing”) drift above Hiroshi’s earthy register, but artifacts never obstruct causal clarity. No loops or scaffold; each sentence adds texture or motion. Final third clean, permitting high band.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clean, scaffold-free sentences; information density high (“shimmering particles that clung…like desperate ghosts” does double sensory work). One mixed metaphor—“seed of real redemption from the liquidation’s ashes”—is forgivable at closure; otherwise no loops or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, not ornamental. Minor loop risk in repeated “storm” and “shadow” motifs, but each recurrence reweights meaning. No clarity breaks; sentence variety supports mounting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, avoiding drumbeat; concrete nouns (“wax-sealed jars,” “rusted gears”) do most lifting. Occasional lyrical overload (“feral loft… lonesome splendor”) risks purple but stays tied to POV mood and never muddies causality. No loops, no scaffold, clean copy. One stray mixed image—“vines reclaiming ruins” beside mechanical gears—barely dulls the final shine.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences carry triple duty—sense data, emotional voltage, world rule—while avoiding paraphrase loops. Metaphors are cleanly stacked: ice as low discord, artifact as high crystal, key as bridge; no vehicles contradict. A single mixed heat/tactile image—“cold metal warming against his skin” repeating in two spots—risks minor scaffold but is forgivable at this length. Closure line is spare and resonant, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and rhythmic; metaphors of “storm held in check” and “silver thread” serve character state. No loops or scaffold. Sentence variety propels momentum. Occasional elevated diction (“unyoke,” “crystalline silence”) fits the mythic tone without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clear, dense, and propulsive—no boilerplate loops. Figurative language (silt-choked echoes, brass patina) serves moment and stakes without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry double duty—setting, emotion, metaphor—without scaffold: “dust motes danced in slanted beams, evoking the quiet energy of forgotten melodies.” Figurative density is high but patterned early (“vibrant hush” taught in line 2) and pays off at closure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; occasional adjective stacks (“tiny mechanical marvel pulsing with brass veins”) stay within POV. Clean mechanics; pronoun and tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with only minor loops (“acid sea” repetition); metaphors cohere and the final cadence tightens without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythmic control in server-hall descriptions alternates between mechanical pulse and synth silence; hyper-density is avoided, though a few stock stems (“terabytes of forgotten data”) creep in.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm rises with wind-gust fragments, ebbs during mirror stillness; no template cadence. Dense double-duty lines (“shard…shattered perhaps by the same tempests”) pack history without scaffolding. Only micro-loop: “their words sharp as cracking ice” echoes prior floe-groan, but the echo is purposeful, not churn.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—long cadence for lull, clipped fragments as storm breaks. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances salvage, memory, or auditory search. Metaphors stay sensory (“floes clattered like forgotten thoughts”) without crowding high-pressure beats. Clean grammar; pronoun tracking clear across shifting ice choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lyrical yet trim; imagery (“taillights fading…like a reluctant farewell”) serves mood without crowding. One mixed metaphor (“amber embrace…etched with…fallen leaves”) is minor. No scaffold loops, no filter-verb clusters. Information density good—single sentences often do two jobs (set detail + emotion). The final paragraph contains three successive “as” constructions—slight cadence repetition, not serious. Readable aloud with only micro stumbles; within elite tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    High figurative density nearly every sentence, yet vehicles stay coherent (sand/curtain, root/aquifer) and serve the Accumulative lens. One paraphrase loop—“whispered… murmurs… whisperfield”—is thematic motif, hence tolerated. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding. Strong propulsion through front-loaded verbs. Final beat free of purple overload. Hairline slip: “kinetic parapet stirred—an ancient object, a living wall” is appositive overkill mid-ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language (“purple blooms swayed like gentle conspirators”) is selective and purposeful. Minor loop risk in “arcs” repetition, but it serves the pattern. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is spare yet sonorous; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates from long, accumulating clauses to abrupt, crystalline fragments under pressure. High information density with zero scaffolding. Final cadence mirrors the crystal’s fading hum.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud reveals varied sentence fronts and natural inhale/exhale rhythm; only two adjacent sentences begin with “He.” Figurative layer stays lean until the climax, where mixed metaphors (“skin folding like waves”) are justified by Elias’s coastal lens. No scaffold loops; each paragraph either moves body, deepens sound, or re-angles driftwood. A single paraphrase hiccup—“the hush… grew insistent” followed immediately by “hush of the unwatched tapes grew insistent”—knocks the tenth of a point off perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dense, compressed sentences accelerate under tremors; occasional purple flourishes (“stratospheric veil”) are forgivable because they serve atmospheric propulsion and don’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is concise with visible momentum: “the pulsing stillness that defined this radiant haven” conveys tone without purple drift. Rhythm mirrors breath as cloud vapors and guitar strums sync. Sensory specificity—“scent of hope, faint but unmistakable like wild jasmine”—anchors the motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, high-density, with strong verbs (“etched”, “whirred”); metaphors stay consistent (clockwork, fireflies) and support theme. Occasional cadence loops (“quietly deliberate” repeated) and one mixed image (“stars wheeled…like melting wax”) nudge it below 8.8, but no artifacts obscure causality or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm varies naturally, high density without loops or synonym loops. A few metaphors stretch (“forgotten ambitions”) but do not muddle. Sentence propulsion accelerates with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template runs. Figurative density is high but patterned—wind, bloom, glass, light—taught by line 3 and paid off in the final mirror-gleam on faces. One paraphrase loop: “memories resurfaced” appears three times within 60 words mid-story (−0.2). Otherwise information density is strong; each clause adds tactile or emotional charge. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.7)
    High density, no loops; figurative language is purposeful. Occasional elevated diction (“verdant moss garden,” “honeyed hush”) flirts with purple but stays within POV. Final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lines carry double duty—description advances stakes (“mist…muffled the distant crash” ties setting to fear of silence). Figurative layering is dense but pattern-taught early and recycled at closure without muddle. Occasional elevated phrasing (“solemnize the bond”) risks register drift yet reads as ritual diction justified by incantatory frame. Zero paraphrase loops; pronoun tracking clean.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene tempo; sentence openings vary, no template runs. Figurative strings stay purposeful—moon “waned without its due reverence” compresses stakes into one visceral clause. One paraphrase loop (“golden stories… golden threads”) costs −0.2; otherwise density is high without scaffold. Artifacts do not touch closure, allowing 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, metaphoric mapping, emotional pressure—“bottle shards fracturing light into latitude lines.” No paraphrase loops; each spiral reference adds new cartographic information. Two mixed metaphors (“world held its breath... auroras paused”) risk excess but are saved by the solstice stillness conceit. Density is high yet propulsive; one clause in four could lose an adjective, keeping this just outside the diamond-cut 9-zone.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Metaphors stay coherent—“veins of quartz pulsed like forgotten heartbeats” sustains geological body-parallel without violating physics. High information density: each line advances angle, echo, or emotional state; no scaffold sentences. Minor register loft in “conceptual repricing” phrase is earned by prior concrete work and appears outside the closure beat, so no 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense, patterned, and read-aloud rhythmic; figurative language (“whalebone reverie”) ties to imagery without fluff. Information density high; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction fits POV’s lexicon. Metaphors cohere, no muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or filler; each sentence lengthens or shortens to pace breath versus pressure. Figurative choices (rain beads as prisms, crystals on spider-silk) stay precise and non-contradictory. Filter verbs are scant and voice-driven. Opening and closing lines book-end with rain-beats, giving lyric circularity without scaffold. No artifact touches the closure stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “droplets hung mid-air like suspended regrets” fuses image and theme. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Figurative language is disciplined, never purple. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she felt”) in one beat keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold (“like a familiar cloak,” “like reluctant farewells”) slightly dulls immediacy but never clutters the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles are coherent (“earthly nostalgia of petrichor” anchors scent and memory), high information density, and propulsive rhythm—minor purple diction balanced by strategic precision elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm accelerates during dive and slows during reflection. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or knowledge. Metaphors are precise—“spectral fingers,” “labyrinth of secrets”—and never mixed. High information density: “coaxing the hidden language to surface like bioluminescent creatures” layers sight, tactility, and epistemology in one stroke. Final line’s cadence mirrors retreating tide, recharging motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, each sentence advancing atmosphere or interiority. Figurative language is purposeful: “thread coiling like a vein” fuses object and body. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“lonesome splendor”) is earned by voice.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and pressure without redundancy. Metaphors (“stalactites… teeth of some ancient beast”) are coherent and purposeful. Minor loop: “flawed genesis” is repeated three times in close proximity, a hairline drag. Otherwise, rhythm modulates with tension, and the final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with differing parts of speech. Figurative density high but patterned early, paid off at closure; no mixed metaphors. Information often dual-job: “split and barren from the blaze that had claimed her father’s final stand” situates tree, backstory, and stakes in one sweep. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; occasional elevated diction justified by lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clear, propulsive, and dense: “glass box unstuck, its panels blooming open” is literal yet lyrical. No loops or scaffold. Metaphor (phantom splashes) charges closure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates naturally—petal-metronome sentences lengthen, then fracture at nexus entry. Information density high; lines carry dual duty (petal-sigh signals both time passage and thematic fatigue). Only minor scaffold: mild alliterative drift (“quiet sigh… soft susurrus”) repeats without new pressure. No artifact touches closure; final line is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory detail or interior motion. Occasional lyric heightening (“thundering calm”) is earned by pattern and never stalls momentum. No loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet muscular; sentences advance both tactile image and moral torque (“the tides had preserved it, returning it now”). Metaphors of glass, fracture, and mirroring cohere without muddling causality. Occasional adjective pairs (“jagged spine of black volcanic glass”) risk minor purple, but never within the climactic beat, so the closure image stays sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm and metaphor are lush yet selective; the “velveteen gloom” refrain threads without paraphrase loops. No line-level opacity in key beats, though a few filler stems dull propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong density— sentences perform double duty (e.g., “ice…mirroring the spire’s angular facets”); occasional modifier stacks (“dark and viscous as congealed night”) flirt with overwriting but peak beat clarity survives; one paraphrase loop on “innovate within the vise of scarcity” mildly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled—one sustained metaphor of dust-as-memory—avoiding purple overload. Occasional lyrical uplift (“thistled calm”) is earned by prior pattern. High information density; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. No artifacts touch closure; one hairline slip (“perpetual fog” repeated within 30 words) prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers image and action (“powdered charcoal clung like forgotten regrets”). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is purposeful—optical illusions mirror emotional vanishings—and never muddles causality. Final ash scatter lands with crystalline precision.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with purposeful cadence shifts under pressure—“the cog’s edges biting my skin like accusations.” Occasional stacked metaphors (“abrasive calm of perpetual damp”) flirt with overwriting but remain legible and voice-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm modulates well, but a few stacked modifiers (“crimson drapes pooling like spilled wine”) momentarily stall momentum. No loops or artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances character, image, or theme. No loops or scaffold; “rusted frames corroding like unspoken regrets” is the only metaphor and it lands clean. Sensory specificity—“sap touched his lips accidentally”—replaces generic description. Final line recharges “sweet tang of possibility” without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: longer anaphoric cadence in opening description, staccato at matchbox flick. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. One mixed metaphor—“double-edged key” unlocking “truths wrapped in enigma”—momentarily blurs tool and gesture. Clean grammar, precise tense, strong verbs outweigh minor flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences perform multiple jobs without scaffold. Figurative layer is dense but taught early ("streetlights daydream") and paid off at closure. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Occasional elevated phrase ("profound silence that lingers") nudges toward purple yet stays within POV lexicon of quiet mystic. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure, and the final threading beat is crystal-clear.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; every sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Metaphors are controlled: “spiraling without origin or end” serves concept and mood. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) fits the POV. One mixed metaphor—“peeling back layers of infinity like onion skin”—is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyric overdrive risks purple tinges (“neon haze blurred the stars into forgotten whispers”) yet pattern is taught early and sustains moonlit incantation. No loops or scaffold; sentences multi-task. Metaphors stay coherent within painterly lexicon. Some modifier stacks (“methodically hopeful”) edge precious but do not stall closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean read-aloud rhythm with sentence-length variation and zero paraphrase loops. Metaphors (“rosewater dread,” “verdant envy”) recur with accruing weight rather than clutter. One fused participle (“laced with the faint, cloying scent…”) could split for tempo, yet no muddle. Information density high—each clause either advances climb or marks thaw progression. No artifacts appear in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty—action and atmosphere—without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (“embers in ash” matches latent radiance). One filter-verb cluster (“felt it: threads…”) but beat remains clear. Final paragraph avoids loops and lands on resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong verbs and varied sentence cadences propel; only minor scaffold (“the method…unfolded here”) and one mixed echo (“fear weakens when flattered by its own lies”) blur edge. No loops or register drift in closure beat; luminance motif stays precise.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sound, motion, and metaphor without redundancy. No loops or scaffold; figurative language stays coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“cryptic script,” “fractal echoes”) fits the prophet’s idiom and never obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful (“golden haze that gilded rooftops”). One paraphrase loop near midpoint (“the turtles’ groans grew labored… the turtles groaned onward”) but no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences are lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is sparing and purposeful. No loops or scaffold intrude on the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose carries high density: “arches interlaced with absences” collapses architecture and emotion in one stroke. Rhythm varies, sentences lengthen under reflection, shorten during the wrest-free beat. Metaphors stay consistent—sea as archive, tide as ink—and avoid muddled vehicles. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “as he” participles, but they do not stall the final image; no loops or synonym churn in the mortar/ink climax.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “coral-encrusted spires pierced the eternal twilight” does world, tone, and stakes in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either indexing progress or environmental pressure. Mixed-metaphor vigilance: “dappled resolve” recurs but pattern-taught early and reprised at closure, so reads as motif, not slop. Final line is crisp, propulsive, leaves resonance without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.4)
    Sentences carry double duty—information + atmosphere—without scaffold: “silver-leaved bushes whispered secrets to the wind” locates garden, sets hush, foreshadows recorded dreams. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay inside craft lexicon (light, glass, paper). No loops or synonym churn; each noun is specific—amethyst, chamois, dream-weave paper. Closure line breathes: “his crafty hands weaving loss into flight” ends on monosyllabic thrust, momentum released.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is propulsive, high-density, and read-aloud musical. Occasional stacked modifiers (“jagged purple heart”) risk purple but serve character obsession. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Minor scaffold in “bleak, exhilarating, eternal” but does not dull closure. Strong syntactic variety under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary; no loops or scaffold. Dense figurative layering (“star trails…threads from a loom”) risk purple but stay tied to POV craft. One mixed vehicle: “brilliant dimness” is self-oxymoronic yet taught early and paid off; allowed. High information density; minor modifier clusters keep it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with diverse syntactic shapes. High density: “sky bleeding into the sea like ink in water” layers visual and kinesthetic metaphor without overwriting. Minor scaffold: “weight of unspoken words” + “each one a stone” is adjacent paraphrase, but does not recur. No artifacts in final third; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    Most sentences advance stakes or texture; occasional lyric scaffolding (“wind howled… mist clung…”) cushions pressure without clogging. Metaphor “handle hidden compartments of the soul” is decorative but brief.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lean yet textured; no loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting—“merrily melancholic” risks cute alliteration—but rhythm accelerates with each paddle stroke, matching urgency. Strong verbs (“slicing,” “arced”) and concrete nouns keep momentum high.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“inverted sky”) serve momentary texture without clutter. One mixed image—“fragile in its worn leather yet enduring”—barely muddies clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is musical and propulsive, but stacked metaphors (“branches twisting like lovers’ arms”) and near-repetitive phrasing (“paradoxically steady” twice) slightly dull the climactic shift.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from languid vapor clauses to the staccato “She pressed her daughter’s tiny handprint.” Figurative layering stays purposeful—each metaphor services the stake of time reclaimed. One paraphrase loop (“beautiful yet suffocating...choking beauty”) costs −0.2; otherwise density is high. Closure image escapes overwriting, earning its shimmer.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “vibrant hush” and “gritty silk of change” compress sensation and concept without purple overload. Sentence variety supports the slow celestial arc; no loops or synonym churn. Final paragraph lands with crystalline clarity and no scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose moves with lock-pick efficiency: each sentence turns twice—advances plot while plating atmosphere (“velvet darkness broken only by faint glow of emergency crystals”). Mixed metaphors absent; moonlight, gears, sparks stay mechanically coherent. One scaffold spot—“her heart steady”—could trim, but occurs post-closure and doesn’t dull ignition image. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph breaks follow beat clicks, guiding downhill spiral momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates with ritual pacing; no loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold; diction stays within Elara’s perceptual lexicon, propelling to the final auroral step.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, each sentence advancing atmosphere or motive; no loops, no mixed metaphors, and the final line’s “storm-kissed wonder” recharges earlier motifs without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is propulsive and concrete—“foil sliced air in arcs”—with no looped metaphors; filter verbs culled, rhythm mirrors fencing cadence; one metaphor (“veins of doubt”) earns its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; only one paraphrase loop detected (“chaos he’d always fled / prison’s raw disorder”). Mixed metaphors are few and minor (“match in wind” beside “blooming flowers in concrete”); they don’t tangle causality. Density is high—each line adds image or beat—yet rhythm breathes at emotional peaks. Proof-level errors absent; a strong line-level showing for this word count.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective—no purple drift. No loops, scaffold, or register drift detected. Grammar and tense are flawless. Opening and closing lines are charged and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet musical; sentences perform double duty (“She awoke with a start, the first stars pricking the sky”). No loops, scaffolds, or filler filters. Two adjacent metaphors—“cocoon of anticipation,” “bioluminescent vines of doubt”—brush maximum density but are saved by pattern repetition that pays off in the moonlit shoot image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—compass pulses, lace whispers, tide breathes—taught by the 25% mark and harvested at closure, so the density penalty is waived. Information often doubles: “severance—when his apprentice…”—efficient. A single mixed metaphor (“anchors…hanging in his chest”) is minor; clarity remains intact. No artifacts touch the final beat, keeping 9+ range open.


== Grader: Qwen 3 235B A22B 25-07 Think ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "glass shards glittered like fallen stars" earns its metaphor through cosmic parallelism. Minor cadence drag in "Humility kindled within her, a slow burn..." slightly dulls momentum, but final line’s "patient rhythm" delivers crystalline propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor synonym churn ("fragile silica/beacons of quiet wonder") but high density in frost-retracing beat. Final line ("steady and unyielding") avoids cliché through concrete charge. No closure-dulling artifacts; rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero prose artifacts; lyrical density ("panes gleaming like frozen stars") serves momentum, but "perpetual twilight" borders on cliché without character-specific filtering in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops; "prismatic glass shattered... like trapped stars" exemplifies textural density. "Inadvertently stubborn nature surfaced" slips into label-speak but recovers instantly with action.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level propulsion excels ("steps soft on the parched earth"), but "amplified quiet" repeats three times with diminishing returns; third instance ("air held that amplified quiet") becomes scaffold. Near-closure density stumbles slightly on rhythmic monotony during the declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density in projection sequence, but scaffold phrasing ("spiritually curious nature pulling her closer") dulls immediacy; no closure-impacting loops, yet synonym churn in bloom descriptions slightly slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density with clear propulsion, but "quaking reverie" repetition (lines 15, 21) creates paraphrase loop dulling momentum. No closure artifacts; strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently. Final line ("texture he had touched") avoids abstraction, but scaffold deduction caps at 8.7 despite otherwise exceptional craft.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.1)
    "Staggering grace" repeats three times with identical phrasing, triggering template-cadence penalty in high-pressure beats. Otherwise crystalline prose; "brass keys scattered across velvet" exemplifies textural specificity, but scaffold loops dull climax momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lethal artifact in climax: meta-comment "wait, that's over—trimming back mentally" breaks immersion and dulls closure. Otherwise strong ("voids where sounds should have been"), but paraphrase loop in "cells divided... knitting wounds" appears twice. Disqualifies 9+ globally per rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density with vivid propulsion but opening cadence ("steps silent... mind a vault") shows template repetition; no artifacts in closure beat preserves momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion, but "contemplative by nature and thoughtfully spirited in his every gesture" is a synonym loop. One density misstep: "the slow thaw of a world long encased, mirroring the core concept" tells instead of shows. Final line’s "melting wilds" avoids closure artifact, though "waking world" edges toward thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in "Firmly adaptive, Elara had learned..." and em-dash overload in seashell description, but no closure artifacts; propulsion remains clean with concrete verbs ("knelt," "traced," "sidestepped").

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "ambered hush" synonym churn (4x) and "summarizing silence" template cadence in high-pressure beats trigger −0.4. Final image ("ambered hush settled") slightly redundant, dulling closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with purposeful figurative language ("fractured across icicles like forgotten memories"), but scaffolded phrases like "weaving them into a tapestry of insight" trigger -0.2 deduction in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multiplies meaning ("droplets clung like forgotten tears" establishes voice and theme), with "ambiguously clear" accruing weight across beats. Final cadence ("logged the night not in isolation, but in connection") achieves propulsion without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "sap from his vines gluing fissures" demonstrates concrete action over telling. Minor register drift in "metaphor for life's deceptive turns" risks abstraction but is redeemed by immediate tactile payoff in polishing. Final line's "unquantifiable truth" avoids thematic echo by rooting insight in the marble's physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong propulsion in climax beats ("Jax maneuvered... fingers hovering"), but overwriting in atmospheric setup ("frost-laced world... delicate balance of cryogenic chill") risks density penalties. No loops or scaffold in closure, though "ethereal grids" borders on stock metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with clear propulsion, but overwriting in "props bobbed like spectral memories" slightly blurs immediacy. No loops or scaffold, yet elevated diction ("languished in disrepair," "pregnant pauses") risks register drift in high-pressure beats. Final line ("holding its breath once more") charges closure, but "spectral memories" metaphor verges on cliché, costing 0.2 in peak-beat precision.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero scaffold or loops; every phrase multiplies meaning ("clouds clung like forgotten dreams" merges setting, emotion, and theme). Final line’s propulsion ("She would descend soon") avoids overwriting while recharging the illustration motif with decisive momentum.

    High density with minimal scaffold, though "drowsy alertness" repetition creates subtle loop. "Skeletal frames whispering secrets" risks mixed metaphor but stays grounded. Zero artifacts dulling closure; propulsion accelerates during confession beat.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor scaffold in "roots twisted through cracked stone like forgotten veins" slightly dulls immediacy; otherwise, high density ("burrowed into earth, tunneling past roots and relics") and clean syntax propel momentum without closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    Filter-verb stacks weaken pressure ("Elena felt," "she perceived"). Yet "notes weaving through hush like threads of light" shows rhythmic control. Final image avoids overwriting—"exuberance budding cautiously" lands with earned specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("air hung heavy... broken only by soft creak") prevents 9.0, but density remains high. No figurative muddle; every line advances atmosphere or character. Final line’s "hush of bronze eternity" delivers crystalline propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft excels in sensory specificity ("tang of brine and old secrets"), but minor scaffold appears in "Elias pocketed his notes and stepped out into the chill wind" (redundant motion). No closure-dulling artifacts, though "symphony of hidden purpose" borders on thesaurus-itis without fully integrating with prior concrete details.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose dazzles with "midnight blue spreading like veins" but suffers density penalties: adjacent lines restate "plumbed the entity's core... plumbed deeper," and "unraveled stillness" repetition risks scaffold despite thematic purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("chronologically homesick" repetition) avoids deduction. High density throughout; "blush of approaching dawn" crystallizes image without figurative muddle in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.1)
    Zero loops but "passionate subtlety" repetition and "soul igniting" create subtle scaffold; high density stumbles only in "conceptual or social cost" abstraction during peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops with high density; "magnificent simplicity" appears twice as label-only phrase. Final line ("unfinished yet eternally alive") achieves crystalline propulsion without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    No loops or muddle, but "static electricity" repetitions verge on template cadence in climax; "joy laced with loss" slightly over-tells where sensory immersion could deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density falters with adjacent figurative overload ("violins humming"/"lanterns like fireflies"); verbatim "whimsically attentive" repetition creates a scaffold loop in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose shows high density and varied rhythm ("iridescent mists rose from the crater's depths"), but minor overwriting in "luminescent ache of exclusion, a glowing sorrow that lit her path but weighed her steps" slightly dilutes momentum in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero paraphrase loops; "crystalline tears" and "fractal echoes" integrate seamlessly into action. Minor overwriting in "laughter in the wind" (0.2 deduction) but no closure-impacting artifacts; propulsion remains relentless through tactile verbs ("dovetailing," "murmuring formulas").

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero prose artifacts; lyrical density serves momentum ("moss glistened like emeralds"). Final line’s "metamorphosis would endure" recharges the premise without overwriting. Minor rhythmic opportunity in mid-transformation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Exceptional density but "haggard awe" repetition (4x) and "wryly earnest" echoes create subtle synonym churn. No closure-dulling artifacts; final image ("dreams alive with colors") avoids purple prose. Near-flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean prose but scaffold loops ("steadily unpredictable" x3) and minor purple prose ("mineral tears"). Final paragraph's "forever changed" slightly sentimental. No closure artifacts, but "overlapping shadows" description in climax has density issues obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops; "tarnished brass relic half-buried" shows textural specificity, but "mosaic of half-remembered dreams" slightly overwrites in high-pressure beat without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative muddle in peak beat: "ghostly artifact of brass and ether" violates physical logic (solid brass vs intangible ether), dulling closure. Paraphrase loop with "trembling certainty" appears 3×, but variation in sentence rhythm prevents 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor synonym churn ("silent twinkling," "unheard symphony" x2) and a filter-verb stack ("her skepticism wavered when visions flickered") dull peak-beat immediacy; otherwise, precise diction ("looms weaving threads") propels momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold in "amplified her ennui" slightly tells; otherwise high density ("kaleidoscope of what-ifs" does triple duty); no closure-dulling artifacts; final line's "hushed thunder" recharges motif with zero loops.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with minimal scaffold, though "waxy and still" for the corpse edges toward cliché; the funeral home’s sensory hierarchy (tang of formaldehyde narrowing to ink’s viscosity) propels momentum without figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    No loops or scaffold, yet "incandescent restraint" and "prismatic shards" edge into overwriting during high-pressure beats, slightly muddling momentum without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    No loops or scaffold; "gloomy cheer" repetition functions as intentional motif; high density in cello sequence ("retelling fragments...converged on universal riddle"); minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing barely touches closure but avoids figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor synonym loops ("desperation laced... hope flickered") and rhythmic monotony in action sequences; avoids figurative muddle but loses propulsion during bartering rotations description.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Near-flawless propulsion ("frost-laced regolith," "hues of rose and ash") marred by paraphrase loops (melancholy x4) in final beats. No figurative muddle, but minor scaffold dilutes closure's emotional charge without harming causality.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or artifacts; "prismatic veils" and "stitching into wing's core" fuse image/action. Final line recharges opening's "broken wonders" with crystalline propulsion. Overwriting risk in "whisper of his soul" averted by concrete context.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Near-flawless propulsion—"frozen lake mirrored the outpost's rust in fractured panes" weaves setting/action—but "air thick with worrying tranquility, as if..." contains minor scaffold redundancy preventing 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Figurative density muddles key beats ("shard of midnight" + "heartbeat dormant" in one sentence); paraphrase loops on "wild hush" persist into final third, disallowing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero synonym loops; "crystal perfume vial" → "talisman against void" shows purposeful reprise. Mild overwriting risk ("lonesome splendor" twice) offset by earned closure charge. Final line’s "captured fragment" crystallizes motif without abstraction. Oxygen gauge’s concrete "red flicker" anchors climax.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loop in "chasing the hush" repetitions (3x) slightly dulls momentum, but high density prevails—"lattice vibrating" crystallizes pressure without figurative muddle. Closure beat remains sharp with "sea whispered approval," though "translucent shapes" borders on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density but scaffold issues: "resonant awakenings" label repeats without fresh embodiment; slight rhythmic monotony in "winter-cracked fields" echoes. Final line ("spirits danced, elated in sorrow") overwrought but closure remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits high density and purposeful rhythm ("splintered docks and silenced songs"), with minimal scaffold. Minor synonym loops ("fractured world into something sacred"/"stitching the dark with light’s embrace") prevent 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor synonym churn ("purposeful wandering" repeated 3x) and abstract phrasing ("faith in the old ways") slightly dull momentum, but lyrical density serves the Accumulative lens. Final line’s "quiet enchantment of continuity" achieves high propulsion with zero loops.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with no scaffold loops, but "screamed subtlety" creates figurative tension in a peak beat; final line’s mist metaphor avoids closure muddle while sustaining propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose achieves lyrical density with minimal scaffold, but "dancing quasars" and "errant stars" verge on mixed metaphor in high-stakes beats, slightly dulling closure's immediacy per Q7 artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Condensation message sequence ("traced," "bloomed," "reformed") forms paraphrase loop; elevated diction ("cryptic medium," "resonant reconfiguration") clashes with Elara’s embodied voice during high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong cadence and textural specificity ("plaster cast smudged with hurried scrawls"), but overwrought phrasing ("labyrinthine surface etched with natural patterns resembling neural pathways") muddles peak beats. No closure-impacting loops.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)
    Exquisite density ("mist danced... chuckling at his intrusion") but meta-commentary creates paraphrase loop and template cadence in closure beat, dulling the final image and disqualifying 9+ per Text-Artifact Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    No figurative muddle or loops in peak beats, but filter-verb stacks ("watching as," "feeling that") dull immediacy during the coin tap sequence. Sentence rhythm accelerates effectively with the echoes, though template cadence appears in setup ("she fingered... she whistled...").

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose dazzles with textural density ("vines twisted like frantic thoughts") yet stumbles in climax: "hands steady amid rustling leaves that seemed to whisper" uses filter verb and mixed metaphor. Minor scaffold loops prevent 9+ despite strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Reef-shadow joy" repeats 4× with near-identical phrasing (synonym churn), and "photosynthesize pain" appears as both method/motivation without concrete mechanics, dulling closure's final transformation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion, though "foxglove regret" and "systematically gentle" create minor synonym loops. No closure-dulling artifacts, but "fracture sealing not physically but in harmony" risks figurative muddle in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid midnight" metaphor integrates cleanly with closure image. Minor overwriting in "dust motes danced like forgotten syllables" slightly dilutes momentum. Final line’s "ready to face whatever lay beyond together" avoids sentimentality through concrete action ("stood closer").

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with minimal loops, though "yellowed and cracked like old scars" risks mixed metaphor. Template cadence appears near climax ("Elias stood... Elias felt..."). No closure artifacts, but minor scaffold in transitional phrasing prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    Minor scaffold in "tone of his days bloomed with fragile hope" slightly dulls momentum; otherwise zero loops, high density ("pulsing faintly in the attic's slanted light" charges closure).

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor figurative muddle in "knots like storm clouds, ridges like wind-swept plains" risks mixed metaphor; template cadence in analysis sequence costs 0.1, but final line achieves crystalline propulsion without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    No closure-touching artifacts; "bittersweet fog" slightly clichéd but redeemed by concrete action. Near-loop in "fragile and quick to dissolve" / "slipping away" deducts minimally. Final image clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lush prose occasionally veers toward overwriting ("symphony of surprise," "calculated wilderness"). One paraphrase loop: "turning strangers into participants" echoes earlier serenading. High density maintained but minor scaffold in climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and precise, but "pain bloomed like a dark rose" creates mixed metaphor (pain doesn’t bloom like a rose), and template cadence in the fledging sequence ("by observing gaps...") slightly dulls climax. No closure artifacts, yet hairline slips prevent 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line propulsion excels: "He adjusted a loose panel, his touch reverent" shows rather than tells transformation. Minor artifact in "noctilucent reckonings" repetition risks overwriting but redeemed by closure integration. No loops; final line's "weight of illuminated truths" charges motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose excels in texture ("silver light spilling across jagged rocks"), but adjacent synonym loops ("spiderwebbed across the lid... burns that mapped his skin") dilute momentum. Final paragraph’s thematic echo disrupts rhythmic control, though no artifacts blunt closure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero closure artifacts and high density, but paraphrase loops in "serene upheaval" descriptions ("calm surfaces hiding turbulent undercurrents... still pools that masked swirling eddies") trigger −0.4, disallowing 9+ per rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in "fluttering like trapped moths" slightly dulls immediacy; otherwise high density with rhythmic propulsion. No loops or figurative muddle in peak beats, but one borderline cliché prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Overwriting in climax ("prismatic echoes that danced like fireflies") triggers density penalty; "fragile rhythm gifted from dying twin" uses therapy-speak label. Strong propulsion otherwise, but metaphor muddle in high-pressure beat prevents 8.5+. Final line’s "heartbeat of tomorrow" avoids sentimentality through concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops in peak beats, but "operatively gentle" label repeats without showing cost (paragraphs 1 and 4), creating synonym churn. Otherwise, high density: "ebony clipboard absorbing... like a confessor’s ledger" fuses object, theme, and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level propulsion stumbles in the climax: "fractured grace of the landscape evoking a ballet frozen mid-step" overwrites the action, diluting the egg-shattering moment's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong density but "alarming serenity" paraphrase loop (mid-story vs. finale) and "bodily poetic" label repetition create scaffold. Minor artifact caps 9+ eligibility despite clean closure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero loops but "fleeting insights illuminated corners of his soul" risks abstraction; elevated diction in epiphany beats slightly clashes with calligrapher's tactile POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose suffers from density overload—figurative language saturates high-pressure beats ("cadence, once harmonious progression... melody cut short" creates mixed metaphor). Paraphrase loops ("transiently rooted" x3) and filter-verb stacks ("she watched it settle") dull closure's impact, violating Q7 9+ requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with dual-purpose prose (e.g., "aurora intensified... casting glows that danced across her labor"), but "snowmelt ardor" and "frozen breaths of elders" form stock metaphor strings in peak beats, triggering −0.5 loop penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("wafer seal... shimmering with iridescent veins"). Overwriting in "precisely playful shadows" (-0.3) but peak beats ("lightning cracked overhead") maintain clarity. Final image propulsion impeccable.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    Severe paraphrase loops ("frugal/thrifty" echoes) and filter-verb stacks during discovery beat; "empirically ironic" label churn dulls closure image with redundant abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats ("reappearing when needed most to mend what hatred had torn") creates density drag; no closure-impacting loops but rhythmic uniformity in middle section reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere ("twilight's frost coated the ruins"). Final sentence "twilight's frost witnessed the mending" achieves crystalline propulsion. Figurative language ("cracked like spiderwebbed ice") remains precise without muddle even in high-pressure breathing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops in closure beat; "blue hue seeping into quartz like dye into water" shows crystalline specificity. Minor paraphrase loop ("deciduous vows" recurrence) prevented 9.0. Final "cathedral seemed to nod" avoids sentimentality through action.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    "Brightened disquiet" and "simply complicated" repeat as thematic mantras, verging on synonym churn that dulls propulsion in the climax. Otherwise, lyrical density ("petals unfurling like forgotten stars") serves momentum, but label-speak ("conceptual cost") in the final paragraph undermines closure’s clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor overwriting in mixed metaphor ("pages rustling like strings plucked in a void, evoking harmonies") slightly muddles causality; otherwise, propulsion excels with zero loops in closure beats and strategic density ("frond wilted into ash revealed coordinates").

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; "faded Ferris wheel cars dangling like broken dreams" exemplifies high-density propulsion; minor overwriting ("unkindled solace") avoids muddle, with final line’s "emerald swatch her anchor" crystallizing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; propulsion via strong verbs ("thrums," "unspooled," "exhaled"). Figurative language ("coiled like a serpent") serves momentum. Minor register drift in "resonant reconfiguration" phrasing, but closure image ("time ticked onward") remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold or loops; "vibrations clashing like hammered metal" shows textural specificity. Minor redundancy: "hammered repose" appears twice without evolved meaning, dulling closure’s cadence shift by 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose propels with varied syntax ("Each dawn, she climbed...") and zero loops. Minor scaffold: "driven by quiet motivation" redundant to preceding action. Thistle repetition risks thematic echo but redeemed by closure charge. Final line's "thistles on the wind" avoids sentimentality through concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Near-zero loops with high density ("lightning etched fleeting maps"), but "preemptively nostalgic" repetition creates synonym churn; figurative language serves pressure except where "raw clay of lived moments" risks purple prose in high-stakes beat.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose shines in sensory specificity ("petal-soft vibrations," "mineral tang"), yet "playfully wrestling the void" risks purple prose, and repetitive "serious playfulness" phrasing creates subtle scaffold in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Minor overwriting ("star-speckled shards whispering of choices deferred") risks density in climax, but metaphors pay off in closure. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. "Gritty drag/silky promise" achieves high-propulsion duality.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    No loops or scaffold; "gilded hush" metaphor risks overwriting ("opulent, with undertones of forgotten luxuries") yet avoids muddle through concrete taste verbs; final line’s "stolen hours" crystallizes momentum without dilution.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via precise verbs ("nudged," "splintered"). Figurative language sparse but potent ("terrace receding like a shattered mirror"), with no muddle in peak beats. Final line recharges motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor overwriting in climax ("visions flooding: orchards eternal") slightly dulls propulsion. Template cadence in "Her mind, a archive..." / "Clutched in her palm..." weakens early momentum. Zero loops in closure beat, but "futuristic nostalgia" repetition in final paragraph risks thematic echo. Information density remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    High density with concrete verbs ("slithering shadows," "ring warmed"), but synonym churn on "charcoal sanctuary" and "fading threshold" creates scaffold; no closure-beat artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-zero loops; high density ("glowing fungi now cradling facets of light" compresses transformation). Minor scaffold in "her motivation crystallizing" (redundant after prior pressure description) dulls one beat (-0.2). Closure image ("pocketed a single diamond... ready for the next seam") avoids figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    "Tarnished but intact" and "whispered secrets to dust motes" flirt with cliché; otherwise, sentence variation ("He mused deeper... visions of boardroom betrayals") sustains propulsion without scaffold in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    No loops or scaffold; "shivering bliss" evolves meaningfully across beats. Slight register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing, but "threads of possibility snaring the air" maintains textural specificity without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; high density ("tarnished but defiant" conveys history in two words). Final line avoids purple prose through earned resonance. Slight abstraction in "perpetual shadow under her eyes" borders cliché but doesn't dull closure—cost remains legible in physical details like trembling hands.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong propulsion ("Heart pounding, she followed illusory lines") but "dusk bled into velvet sky" and "fog of forgetfulness" verge on overwriting. No scaffold loops, though "revised histories" repetition risks thematic redundancy; final line ("reappeared hope") elegantly recharges motifs without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold in repetitive phrasing ("quietly vivid" x2) and template cadence in reflection blocks; no closure-dulling loops, but synonym churn in atmospheric descriptions ("eerie nostalgia," "quietly vivid") slightly saps momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with phrases like "visions flooded her mind—images of forgotten epochs," but template cadence in monument descriptions ("miniature spire... wee archway") creates subtle loops. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero scaffold/loops; "swirling leaves" repetition in high-pressure beat creates subtle cadence shift. "Damp earth and decay" overwriting in greenhouse entry slightly dulls immediacy without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-zero loops; "luminous regret suffused the chamber" risks abstraction but is redeemed by immediate "ache in his chest" embodiment. Slight register drift in "ethereal potentials" is offset by concrete "gutter rainwater" usage in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero line-level artifacts; every sentence propels atmosphere or character. "Notes warped like heat haze" does triple duty (sensory detail, tension builder, emotional metaphor). Final line recharges "luminous ache" with crystalline specificity—no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-zero artifacts; "displaced rootedness" and "Braille of errors" avoid purple prose through character-specific logic, though "relentless UV haze" slightly overwrites in one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("lanterns flickered as if breathing" establishes setting, foreshadows dissolution, and modulates tone), with figurative language precise even in climax ("warming as barriers dissolved").

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong opening rhythm and textural specificity ("ticket stubs scattered like confetti") degrade under scaffold loops ("Wait..."; "No, recount properly") clustered in the closure beat, dulling the final image's propulsion and triggering −0.7 artifact penalty for closure-touched prose.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops in closure beats, but "whispers in the wind" is a cliché and "trembling as if breathing" slightly overwrites. Final image ("frost's patterns immortalized in ink") achieves crystalline propulsion, though minor artifacts prevent 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    Figurative density blurs storm scene: "timeline tendrils coiling" and "arches groaning" reduce immediacy. "Burnished sorrow" repeats 4x; template cadence ("Elias, [comma], [verb]") dulls key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm to propel tension ("It didn't wilt; instead, it glowed"). Minor deduction for "wilts near dishonesty" lacking concrete demonstration beyond the chip's quiver during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with propulsion, but "hinged awakening began, the first pivot swinging open like a door" mixes metaphors (hinges vs. door), slightly muddling the peak beat. Minor synonym churn in "resonant hush" repetitions.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose dazzles with 'salt-slick air' specificity, but 'scaffold complexity with simplicity' suffers tell-don’t-show repetition. Near-closure, 'turbine-hum' recurs 3x with minimal variation, dulling momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "sodden leaves," "thinning white crust" exemplify textural specificity. Every sentence multi-tasks (e.g., "pooling into rivulets that carved paths" advances setting/mood/theme). Near-flawless rhythm variation—longer sentences in reflection, clipped phrases during discovery ("One panel depicted night flowers"). Final line’s "blooming certainty" slightly clichéd but redeemed by earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.3)
    High density with minimal scaffold—"decrypting in her retrocognitive grip" does triple duty—but minor artifacts like "tension of truth coiled like a spring" slightly blur clarity in a high-pressure beat. Final line ("renewed purpose skyward") propels closure perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose shines in atmospheric descriptions ("fog-shrouded docks," "glowing life"), but paraphrase loops ("rejecting false comfort" x3) and "mental forge" metaphor repetition dull momentum in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "loamy breath" and "genie's wish" show textural specificity. Propulsion accelerates during immersion ("soft hiss rose, like parchment unrolling in reverse"). Minor deduction for "gnarled apple trees" generic descriptor, though context redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero closure artifacts, high density ("heart a storm caged in stillness"), but "Placing... Chanting... tracing" template cadence in action sequence slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops, high density ("wind howling through arrow-slit windows" does triple duty); minor deduction for near-cliché "glue dried true" saved by context; final line avoids thematic echo through concrete action ("listening prevailed over noise" earned by toll).

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong propulsion but "spiritually curious" phrase repeats verbatim (paragraphs 2/5), triggering synonym churn penalty. No closure artifacts, but scaffold weakens mid-story density.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyrical density occasionally muddles; 'flickering like mirages given form' creates minor physical logic clash in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops with high density, but "hours stretched into sentiments rather than seconds" triggers thematic echo penalty (-0.4) mid-beat; otherwise flawless propulsion through concrete verbs ("pried," "pulsed," "trembled") in high-pressure sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm ("But as the wind gusted sharper..." accelerates tension), though "harmonizing the discord" repetition risks slight cadence echo in final beats without deepening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush yet efficient, but adjacent-line repetition ("brazen calm" x3) and "copper sheen" verge on template cadence, diluting momentum in pivotal beats without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose soars with purposeful density ("cosmic whisper that had shattered old certainties"), but "luminous skepticism" repeats as near-synonym ("luminous like her own skeptical fire"), triggering minor scaffold penalty. Final line’s "unspoken dawn" avoids overwriting while charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "volcanic soils" elixir and "bioluminescent pulses" show high density, but "whispering of resilience" slightly overwrites in high-pressure beat without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "shack lit by salvaged lantern's flicker" compresses setting into action. Docked 0.3 for borderline mixed metaphor ("tinted revelations began to unfold; the cylinder's authors... had encoded warnings"). Zero loops or scaffold in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion ("flicker caught her eye—a glimpse of movement") but minor redundancy in "echoed silence" and "resonant hush" slightly dulls momentum in one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Template cadence in swap sequence ("With gloved hands steady... In its place... He approached") creates rhythmic monotony; "festering like doubt" overwrites a critical beat.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero scaffolding loops but "luminous absence" (4x) and "benevolently ruthless" (2x) create minor synonym churn in final beats; "spelling hope across marble" exemplifies crystalline propulsion and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.9)
    Overwriting in closure beat: "shimmering with purpose" dulls final image. Paraphrase loops ("substituting reality... substituting reality") and mixed metaphor ("thunder grumbled distantly, hidden in mountain's belly") harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("winnowing false paths from true ones, sifting regret from redemption") slightly dulls momentum; otherwise impeccable propulsion with platinum's "merciless precision" crystallizing Elias's state—zero scaffold in high-pressure labyrinth sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft dazzles but exhibits minor overwriting: "forged hush, a silence hammered into shape" repeats concepts. Template cadence appears in "she refracted... each line... she refracted..." yet maintains propulsion toward closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("acid gnawed," "gears whirred"). Every sentence multi-tasks: "key ring charm dangled... suspending time" advances plot/atmosphere. Near-perfect density—only "dire enchantment" phrasing borders on repetition in final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; "crystalline pool fed by underground spring" exemplifies textural specificity. One abstract phrase ("suspended the soul") in peak beat prevents 9.0, but propulsion ("stumbled into a concealed chamber") never falters.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is crystalline but has two hairline slips: "screaming in quiet fury" creates contradictory embodiment, and "whispers that outdistanced thunder" slightly overwrites. Final line avoids cliché with "promise kept" resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; high density ("fingers brushed patina bronze censer foot" conveys action, symbol, emotion). Final line crystallizes closure without overwriting: "piecing solace from the night" avoids metaphor muddle. Rhythm varies naturally under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level propulsion stumbles in the research sequence ("pored over discredited textbooks... pages brittle with age") where scaffold phrases dilute momentum; no closure-adjacent artifacts but density falters in mid-beat reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "softly persistent" repetition in Q9D causes minor scaffold. Figurative language ("bruised indigo sky") serves pressure without muddle, though "shroud" metaphor slightly strains in final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor scaffold in "empirically intuitive" repetition slightly dulls peak beats but redeemed by concrete demonstrations. Zero loops otherwise; final line crystalline ("leaving solitude's shadows"). Propulsion flawless despite lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    Near-flawless rhythm but "breathing starlight" metaphor repeats consecutively in paragraphs 4-5, risking synonym churn. Final image ("ridge's whisper") avoids closure artifacts while maintaining propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.1)
    Overwritten phrases ("logarithmic grace," "mathematical poetry") dilute high-pressure beats; minor scaffold in "scientifically romantic" repetitions, but propulsion remains strong until final third.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density with propulsion: "jaded wonder blooming as he glimpsed the cabin below" layers emotion and action. Minor scaffold in "a raw, untamed yearning for the boy he'd been" (redundant after "feral nostalgia"), but no closure-dulling artifacts. Figurative language ("wings of memory unfurled") stays consistent with Elias' voice.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose soars in texture ("dripping reservoirs a silent echo of forgotten pulses") but synonym churn in "occluded views" (repeated 3x) and "trembling calm" (2x) creates scaffold; final line’s "unseen miracles now within reach" avoids overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor metaphor muddle: "lightning forked like angry veins" strains biological coherence; "crystals" repetition (5x in climax) edges toward scaffold, yet line propulsion remains taut through sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion; "bubbles rising in defiance of gravity" risks slight register drift but pays off in closure. Zero loops—every phrase advances atmosphere or stakes, like "fjord quiet deepened as dusk fell" charging the final transformation without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythmically (“Her job was to safeguard...” vs “Something was wrong”). “Bioluminescent wildfire” repetition slightly muddles in third use (“intensifying pulse”), but density remains high. No closure-impacting artifacts—final image (“hollow space within”) retains crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose dazzles with "clover melancholy" texture and rhythmic control ("gleamed under the hazy sun, its wooden shelves bowed"). Minor overwriting in "soul's aperture" risks abstraction, but final line’s concrete "gathered the notes, ready to teach" rescues momentum before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level propulsion stumbles slightly in "ethereal tones that echoed off pipes," where "ethereal" borders on purple prose. Otherwise, zero loops; concrete verbs ("jangled," "rubbed") anchor momentum. Final line’s "eternal echo" crystallizes closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with propulsion—"pricking stars," "unfurled petals" avoid cliché. Slight paraphrase loop in "context changed" repetitions but no closure-dulling artifacts. Strategic telling compresses backstory while maintaining causal chain for covenant discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong propulsion with vivid specifics ("cracking like brittle ice" embodies facade), but "polite anarchy" repetition borders on template cadence. Mixed metaphor ("cracking like brittle ice") slightly muddles peak beats without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; high density ("dowsing rod carved from resonant wood" does triple duty). "Silent screams within her soul" edges toward label-speak but redeemed by immediate concrete action (kneeling at pool). Closure beat pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "ethereal ink materialized from quantum flux" achieves high density without muddle. Final beat ("nib bending slightly") delivers closure image with crystalline clarity; no artifacts in peak pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor artifact: "volcanic tenderness" repetition risks overwriting (4x), but rhythm varies purposefully; "soul of history" abstraction in para 1 slightly dulls closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Template cadence in movement sequences ("She began... She arrived... She remained") triggers -0.5 deduction; beautiful density but synonym churn in sorrow descriptions dulls closure's immediacy despite strong opening/final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose avoids loops and scaffold, yet "containers groaning as if alive" slightly strains physical logic; high-pressure beats maintain rhythmic control without muddling causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "spiralingly calm" creates adverbial clutter in a pivotal beat; no closure-adjacent artifacts though "stillwater tension" borders on thematic echo without sufficient embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with "fractured light" and "doubts blooming into curiosity," but "forests of second thoughts" repeats verbatim three times with synonym churn ("germinating," "saplings"), triggering -0.4 artifact penalty in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lush prose risks density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "tremor—not of fear..."), with slight metaphor muddle ("whispered secrets"). Final image’s propulsion ("dove into the deep") compensates, though scrimshaw’s warmth-to-burning shift feels slightly mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero scaffold in peak beats; "peeling away layers in deliberate strokes" demonstrates high density. "Remade hush" repetition earns pattern credit without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("dissolving boundaries") and abstract phrasing ("tremor of certainty") dull closure's immediacy. Line propulsion falters slightly in the colonnade description, though imagery remains vivid and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely crystalline ("iridescent glass shards"), but scaffold dilutes momentum: "bartered awakenings had become the hidden currency" feels expositional. Minor synonym churn ("resilient borders"/"resilient core") prevents 9.0 despite strong closure imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose achieves high density ("crimson lows of rumbling earth") with zero scaffold loops. Minor overwriting in "velvet against the soul—smooth yet resilient" risks mixed metaphor, but rhythm variation sustains propulsion through pivotal closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero closure artifacts; high density ("grief-worn skin"). One paraphrase loop ("mourning jewelry—lockets etched...") in early beats triggers −0.3 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops with high density, but "quantum spark" creates coherence break in high-pressure beat (para 4), muddling physical logic. Final line's "steadily unpredictable tapestry" redeems with crystalline propulsion, though artifact in climax beat blocks 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    Paraphrase loops ("softly deliberate" x3, "luminous regret" x2) and filter-verb stacks ("clutched... noticed... had always found") dull immediacy in peak beats. Prose density suffers despite vivid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor synonym churn ("shattered illusions"/"fragile convictions") and borderline anthropomorphism ("scales flickering... as if remembering") prevent 9.0; no loops in closure beat preserves momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    No fatal loops, but minor scaffold ("she had always been accidentally telepathic") and near-redundant "profound, unbroken" hush phrasing prevent 9.0; sentence rhythm varies purposefully through digging sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor scaffold in "whispers of spectral screenings" and "tears welled" abstraction slightly dull momentum, but high density ("splicing reels under the same bulb") and closure propulsion ("film strip clutched like a talisman") avoid severe loop penalties despite two synonym-churn instances.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level density excels but "unspoken words" repetition and "shadowed rapture" reuse create subtle synonym loops; "comet's tail" metaphor slightly overwrites the pivotal breakthrough beat.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    No closure artifacts, but minor scaffold in "dunes stretched ahead, blooming under the moon’s indifferent gaze, their glow a tonic" repeats "blooming" unnecessarily, slightly diluting momentum before charm sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong propulsion but suffers minor overwriting ("thoughts roamed free like beasts in an endless savanna") and template cadence in translocation sequences; final line avoids artifacts with "hum eternal" crystallizing motif.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "boots sinking into damp earth that cradled each hesitant stride," though "veils of fog" edges toward cliché without sufficient novelty.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion with high density ("jagged blue walls pierced endless white drifts"), but scaffold appears in "driven by quiet motivation" and "safety here meant isolation" – minor tells that dilute immediacy without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor scaffold detected ("her frame woven from earth's deepest iron veins, yet her demeanor remained regally unpretentious") creates slight paraphrase loop. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats; final line ("timeless peace restored in quiet victory") delivers propulsion without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("bleaching events recurring like clockwork" avoids cliché through context). Slight figurative muddle in "eternal cycles—death blooming into barren eternity," but closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Filter-verb stacks in opening ("was driven," "sought," "spotted") dull immediacy, triggering -0.5. Otherwise vivid propulsion: "rust mottled with starlight" compresses setting/action. Final image ("bare feet planted firm") avoids closure muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line propulsion falters in reconstruction descriptions ("bathhouses and geothermal pipes amid sulfurous mists"); minor synonym loops ("fragile tapestry woven from ash and hope"/"reconstruction would transform—not just stone and steam") reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless rhythm and specificity, though "quietly talented hands" and "pearl of stillness" approach scaffold phrasing; minor tell-don't-show in "her motivation crystallized" slightly dulls propulsion in the reflection beat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.9)
    "Luminescent glow... luminescent ache... glow of possibility" creates paraphrase loop in peak beats; high density in opening ("phantom footsteps... jagged pieces") lifts score, but metaphor repetition dulls closure’s final cord-binding image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong propulsion and specificity, but scaffold appears in the raid explanation ("During the totality... time itself betrayed them") and slight synonym churn ("shrouded"/"hush"). Final paragraph's abstraction ("cosmic mercy") dulls closure density.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loop in "time fractured...amplifying every racing thought" dulls one high-pressure beat; otherwise, zero scaffold and crystalline specificity ("gilded in contraband ink") drive propulsion without muddying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold, but "petals unfurling like flames frozen in quiet defiance" risks overwriting in high-pressure beat; final line’s density ("engraved quiet a beacon") achieves crystalline propulsion without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "vines curled and snapped" avoids scaffold, but "fractals of forgotten light" slightly strains metaphor coherence. Final image’s "warm with captured divinity" achieves crystalline specificity without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with minimal scaffold; "air thinned to a hush" exemplifies purposeful lyricism, but "playful symphony" in high-tension beat risks overwriting and dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    Template cadence ("time folded... time folded") in climax triggers -0.5 artifact penalty. High density elsewhere, but "black hole devours light" metaphor muddles closure's emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor overwriting in opening ("whispering grotto shrouded in perpetual mist") slightly dulls momentum. No closure-dulling artifacts; strong propulsion in mandala sequence where "sifted it through fingers" shows concrete action over telling. Sentence variety supports scene urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero scaffold/loops but "warm coldness" repetition (4x) creates synonym churn. "Aberrant mercy bloomed" in climax triggers -0.6 for thematic echo; otherwise exceptional density and propulsion through concrete verbs ("cradled," "stirred," "wove").

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "lanterns strung like fireflies swayed gently" weaves setting/action. One paraphrase loop ("navigated the maze by memory... by memory") deducts minimally; final line’s "fractured paths could realign" charges closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    "somatic awareness, those subtle bodily signals— a flutter... that neuroscientists called markers" contains a paraphrase loop and Wikipedia-voice. The final "profound—a map of the unseen" uses abstract tell where concrete show was demanded, dulling closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong opening rhythm falters near closure: paraphrase loops ("smooth and ancient... perfectly preserved") and template cadence ("spikes of fear... pools of resolve") dull immediacy. Artifacts avoid closure-beat severity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "ochre ones from desert nomads, symbolizing endurance" integrates action/image. Final line’s abstraction ("freedoms won from silence") dulls closure’s texture slightly, but no figurative muddle in peak beats. High density with clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or muddle, but "prudently daring" repeats 3x with diminishing concrete payoff, and "silver hush" overuse slightly dulls final image's freshness despite strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with clean propulsion, but "spindrift serenity" repetition and phrases like "percolate through the sieve of serenity" risk overwriting in high-pressure beats. No closure-dulling artifacts, yet slight cadence rigidity in mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion with high density ("visions fractured the air around him: timelines splintering like cracked pottery"), but minor synonym loops in "thrumming" descriptions (repeated 3x with slight variation) prevent 9.0 despite no closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops with crystalline rhythm ("curling away like a sigh"), yet "wistfully pragmatic" label repetition in high-pressure beats risks thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold—every line advances atmosphere or character, like "cloud-silk whispered secrets to the wind" doing triple duty. Minor overwriting risk in "microstructures of time in shimmering fractals," but density remains purposeful without muddying the pivotal ritual beat.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    Minor synonym churn: "unfurling" and "uncoiling" describe spiral redundantly. Strength: Zero loops in climax; "envelope clutched like a talisman" achieves high density without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    Critical artifact in closure beat: "air thickening... like whispers grinding against rusty gears" mixes metaphors (whispers can't grind), dulling the pivotal image. Otherwise strong propulsion but this closure-adjacent flaw triggers -0.5 overwriting penalty per rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero closure-impacting loops; "fractals of space unfolding" shows crystalline specificity. Minor deduction for "wistful rebellion" repetition (synonym churn) and "transfixing essence" abstraction in mid-beat, though propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold in peak beats, but "mist clung like forgotten regrets" risks mixed metaphor; "methodically she scanned... methodical hands" incurs minor synonym churn (-0.2) without harming closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero scaffold or loops; high density ("bloated with seawater" conveys decay and urgency). Minor deduction for "nervously confident" repetition (0.1), but propulsion remains unbroken through peak decoding scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops in closure beat but scaffolded "sculpt possibility" phrasing in mid-story creates synonym churn. High density otherwise; "pixelated as if etched by digital ghosts" risks figurative muddle yet pays off thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Paraphrase loops in closure beat ("looping rails," "circle back") and filter-verb stacks ("viewed," "observed") dull immediacy. Foreign money description repeats with minimal variation. Final line's mixed metaphor ("harmonize echoes in twilight") obscures conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong propulsion with varied syntax, but adjacent lines risk paraphrase loops ("worn leather chair, the midnight solace wrapping... inviting her to merge dream and starlight"). Figurative language stays purposeful (stars as "celestial beacons" echoing emotions), though "stirring memories" slightly echoes "fragile relic" earlier. Final image’s clarity (petals "stir... revived") avoids closure muddle, but mid-story density nudges toward scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops; high density ("shards glittered like fallen stars amid churning fruit-laden limbs" weaves setting/action); no figurative muddle in climax where seed "thrummed like captured heartbeat".

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Paraphrase loops in "anxious elation" descriptions dull high-pressure beats; otherwise vivid propulsion, though "maze topiary clipping" description borders on ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Synonym churn in "inlaying meaning everywhere" (4 repetitions) and template cadence ("fingers traced... knelt... pulled out") dull high-pressure beats. Closure image ("crumbled to dust") remains potent despite minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose achieves high density ("hollow ache in his chest" mirroring quarry shadows), but "mechanical heartbeat echoing his pulse" strains metaphor logic, slightly dulling closure’s propulsion without artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "woven from conductive vines that sparked faintly" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One near-miss: "wove a tapestry of understanding" slightly overwrites, but the final image ("bridge rebuilt through thought and time") avoids figurative muddle, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor overwriting in "smelted it—not with fire, but through alchemical acceptance" risks figurative muddle; otherwise, propulsion is relentless with zero loops, though this abstraction touches the closure-adjacent moment.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.1)
    Figurative density ("latent radiance," "sorrow bartered for survival") occasionally muddles causality in the climax; minor synonym loops ("resonant hush"/"shared radiance") dilute closure’s sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "ivy tendrils curled like accusing fingers" shows embodied metaphor, but "raw solace" repetition in paragraphs 1 and 4 risks synonym churn, slightly dulling final image despite contextual depth.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    "Motivation ignited like a cautious flame" creates mixed metaphor (bubbling liquid vs. igniting fire); minor synonym churn ("restrained joy"/"exuberant wonder") in climax beats dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops but "mulberry ache" reused as sensation/metaphor in adjacent lines; "propagate destinies" explanation momentarily stalls momentum with reflection, though closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops but "lucidly watchful" appears 3x (lines 12, 18, 24) with diminishing returns, dulling immediacy near climax. Exceptional density ("brushes of spider silk," "captured fireflies") offsets minor scaffold in oblivion description.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with minimal scaffolding ("tears traced her cheeks, but her smile was serene"), but "kindly decisive" recurs three times as near-synonym churn. Final line resonates ("each rebirth a scalloped edge"), though elevated diction ("patina of forgotten eras") slightly drifts from caretaker lexicon in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line propulsion falters in high-pressure beats: "her words vulnerable yet guarded, like sharing a secret behind a locked door" uses redundant metaphor ("guarded"/"locked"), diluting momentum near climax.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.1)
    Figurative density blurs stakes in climax ("broadest and slowest ring held a withheld warning"); 80% of final beat uses stacked metaphors. Template cadence in ripple descriptions ("first ring whispered... deeper rings revealed") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.1)
    Zero scaffold in closure, but "vibrations hummed in her veins" uses diagnostic label-speak in peak beat (-0.4), and "wheels... sliced... amplified" exhibits template cadence in bird sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero prose artifacts; every line advances atmosphere or character ("ephemeral paths, she glided downward" compresses motion and theme), with rhythmic cadence accelerating during descent beats while maintaining crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm ("Bubbles trailed like unspoken words"). Figurative language enhances clarity ("luminous vows whispered to stars"). Final line recharges "hush" motif with precision. Minor cliché ("coral-crusted tomb") redeemed by context.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("last fish was caught the night before" implies collapse). Figurative language serves theme ("drips... Morse code of grievance"). Final line slightly generic ("bridge to what was lost") prevents 9.4.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero paraphrase loops but "precisely humane" (3x) and "mirrored hush" repetitions verge on scaffold; lyrical density in opening risks muddling causality ("twilight bled into velvet black" delays plot).

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with minor overwriting ("liquid prisms" slightly mixed metaphor). Zero scaffold loops; "miniature galaxies" metaphor risks purple prose but serves scientific imagination. Final line avoids sentimentality via concrete orchard imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion with zero scaffold loops. Slight overwriting in "relentless pressure to discern patterns in the dark before they unraveled everything" but density serves pressure without muddling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    "Emotions flooding back in a torrent" is tell-not-show scaffolding in peak beat; otherwise, high density and vivid verbs ("twitching faintly," "igniting like stars") propel momentum without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.7)
    Template cadence ("mournfully eager" x3, "off-key wind" overuse) dulls propulsion; mixed metaphors ("winds birthed... carried half-sung lullabies") create figurative muddle during pivotal maceration beat.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero paraphrase loops, but "dimensionally homesick" repetition and "patient resolve" weak modifiers slightly blunt momentum. Final image ("path back to her true archives") achieves clarity without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density with "vines of ethereal silver unfurling" charging closure, but "frozen bloom" repetition across beats risks subtle scaffold. Final line avoids purple prose, though "thawing into vibrant possibility" edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose soars with "skeletal towers once beaming voices" yet stumbles on redundant "serenely electric" labels in key beats, slightly muddling the fragment's physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Filter-verb stack in the climax ("mind raced... resolve anchored him; this was no nightmare") dulls immediacy, compounded by synonym churn ("luminous mist," "luminous webs"). Strong opening cadence degrades into mechanical rhythm during the radio sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero closure artifacts; high density with propulsion ("Mirrors cracked in spiderweb fissures"). Minor loop: "unsettling calm" repeats without evolution, and "realistically imaginary" feels forced. No figurative muddle in peak beats, though reflection beats show slight synonym churn ("alter/shift/morph").

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Exceptional texture ("shadows clung like forgotten whispers") with minimal loops, though "reeling hush" repeats verbatim. Minor scaffold in "driven by an insatiable need to understand how the heart's rhythms persisted beyond the grave" slightly dilutes momentum before the inciting pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-zero loops and high density ("gold flecks catching his light like stars in ink" → "pulsed faintly, as if alive"), but minor scaffold in "motivated by a vow to stand by the unremembered" slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor paraphrase loops in shattering-cup scene ("fragments" x4) but ink description ("danced like whispers from the void") delivers high density; final line's "bloomed" purposefully echoes ink's "bloomed across floor" for closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=10.0)
    No loops or scaffold; "mineral dew that hummed against his skin" exemplifies triple-duty prose. Final line recharges opening echoes with conceptual precision. Zero figurative muddle—every metaphor ("cracked like a shattered promise") serves causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero closure artifacts; "laughter like cracking ice" charges final image. One paraphrase loop: "bitterness dissolving... reshaping resentment" risks synonym churn but saved by concrete action ("veins glowing with untamed light").

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loops in music descriptions ("resonantly soft" x3) and overwriting ("gentle vibration that seeped like morning dew") create subtle momentum drag; otherwise strong density and propulsion, with closure image ("scattering like fireflies") escaping artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion, but "respectfully rebellious" label repeats without deeper embodiment; minor overwriting in "thunderstorm in a bottle" description risks diluting high-pressure beats despite purposeful metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line craft near-flawless—varied syntax, "dew-kissed leaves" specificity—but "misting hush" and "whispering gleam" verge on repetition loops in final beats, slightly dulling closure’s propulsion despite purposeful intent.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level propulsion excels ("frayed like half-remembered dream" → "silk catching lamplight in ripples"), but "cosmic lyre" metaphor slightly muddles the peak beat. No loops; strategic density in "hyperbolic realm within the library’s core" avoids overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Zero loops in climax but "vitalizing" scaffold in paragraph 2 triggers -0.4. Purple prose risk ("grogan with tomes that only revealed truths") offset by precise darkroom mechanics. Final line's "painting the world even in absence" achieves resonant compression.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.7)
    Severe paraphrase loops: "enveloped secrets" repeats 4× with near-identical phrasing in critical beats; "disorient/disorienting" appears 5×. Final paragraph's synonym churn ("unlocked at last"/"heart unlocked") dulls closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "barnacle-crusted anchor chain" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language serves pressure ("kelp like forgotten guardians"), never muddles. Peak-beat syntax ("traced the patterns... hum rose") accelerates without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stunning texture ("dust motes danced like forgotten memories") marred by adjacent scaffold loops: "her feet betrayed her... heels scraping... caught herself" uses repetitive stems; filter-verbs dilute high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor synonym churn ("budding hope" repetition) and near-label trait ("insatiably creative") slightly dull peak beats; otherwise high density and resonant final line.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    No loops or scaffold; high density ("interlaced hush thickened, accumulating silence like fog") propels momentum, though "lucid unrest" repetition risks slight overwriting in mid-beats without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "the beam cutting through mist like a cautious revelation" integrate setting/action/theme. Final line avoids overwriting while charging closure—only minor deduction for borderline abstract phrasing at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero prose artifacts: "melancholy symphony of static" layers sound/emotion without muddle; paragraph rhythms vary to match pressure (longer for reflection, clipped for discovery). Final line's "half-remembered promise" recharges the snow globe motif with crystalline clarity—no loops or overwriting in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Final paragraph’s "mending the unspoken voids" uses therapy-speak that violates balladeer’s lexicon. "Tinkersong wonder" repetition and "driftingly alert" cadence loops dull immediacy near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density with clear propulsion, but "fond curiosity for the secrets others buried, as if she were an old friend peering gently" risks paraphrase-looping.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops with high density, but "fracturing into tiny motes that floated free, integrating like parole granted" stacks metaphors, muddling closure image; propulsion otherwise flawless with concrete verbs ("incise," "tally," "shivered").

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion stumbles only in peak beats: "brittle" repeats three times (ground/memory/resolution), and "remorse flooded her—flashes..." slightly abstracts the absorption, though vivid verbs like "grinding away jagged regrets" maintain density.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("stars borrowed light generously" compresses victory). Final line’s "symphonies" avoids cliché via concrete prior work. Minor register drift: "rehabilitate" feels academic amid lyrical prose, dulling closure charge slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Overwriting in neural modification beat—"precise in their disorder, like lightning carving new rivers in the brain's vast canyon"—creates competing metaphors that blur causality; otherwise zero loops with high density.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong propulsion but "clandestinely luminous" appears 4x with near-identical phrasing; synonym loops ("latent blaze"/"inner fire") dilute closure impact despite vivid final image.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero scaffold loops; high density ("hummed faintly when touched, a relic from the world’s noisy past") propels momentum, though one borderline figurative stack ("sigh long withheld") slightly muddles peak beat clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with propulsion, but ritual scene's "threads weaving into cracks like defiant roots" creates minor figurative muddle. No closure artifacts, yet peak-beat modifiers slightly blur immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero scaffold or loops; propulsion maintains clarity through reality shifts. Repetitive use of "cyclically spontaneous" (4x) approaches synonym churn in mid-story, slightly dulling momentum without payoff in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-zero loops; "heart pounding" is label-only emotion but quickly embodied by pocketing sea glass. Final line ("bottled essence of safety") achieves high density without muddle, though "shadows danced like lost souls" borders cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor overwriting in opening ("dance as eternal as tides") and one paraphrase loop ("steering... funneling them"). No artifacts in final third, but density slightly blurs pressure in high-stakes beats.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless density: "sapphire to teal in hypnotic waves" does triple duty. Minor paraphrase loop with "quietly explosive" (3x) and "watchful" (3x) in opening; no closure impact. Figurative language serves pressure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    Opening line stellar, but mixed metaphor ("fractured mosaic... fireflies") and template cadence in song sequence ("one by one...") create loops. Final paragraph paraphrase ("binding and releasing... harmonious renewal") dulls closure image despite lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion with concrete verbs ("nudged," "trailing," "yielded"), but "enlarged tranquility" variations form a subtle paraphrase loop across three beats. Figurative language remains clear yet slightly over-polished in the descent sequence, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "frost nipping the air" avoids cliché through concrete action. Final line’s rhythm ("holding her vigil against the fade") crystallizes closure without muddle. Minor overwriting risk in "crimson decay" but offset by purposeful density—every phrase advances atmosphere or character.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Quartz hush" repeats four times in final paragraph without deepening, creating paraphrase loops that dull closure's charge. Otherwise exemplary propulsion: "inserted the probe... capturing pulses... registered on her ornate gauge" compresses action into kinetic syntax. Final line’s "frosted sigh" avoids sentimentality through concrete texture.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor scaffold weakens momentum: "false start" phrasing repeats identically for three attempts, and "comforting unease" becomes a looped motif; strong verbs ("lunged, snatching") propel climax but final paragraph’s abstraction ("path cleared by vigil") dulls closure’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    High-density prose falters in final paragraph with redundant interjections ("recalibrate... trim back") that dull closure's impact. Otherwise masterful rhythm and concrete specificity avoid overwriting pitfalls.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density falters in "hearts grown too accustomed to the wordless hush" (cliché abstraction). No closure artifacts, but stacked modifiers ("prismatic veils... ethereal glows") dilute propulsion in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero loops; peak-beat density crystallizes stakes: "micro-vortex" compresses chaos into visceral image. Final line’s "veined fragility" avoids muddle, recharging motif with closure weight. Figurative language restrained to earned moments.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with propulsion ("pried it open at last, the aged locket yielding"), but scaffolded calm motif ("calm anchor," "sandstorm calm") creates subtle paraphrase loop. Final line's "quiet power that follows where ears lead" slightly overwrites.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold—sentences multitask ("fingers fluttering as if spinning silk from vulnerability's thread" advances plot, theme, and setting). Figurative language precise even in climax; final line’s rhythm variation ("carried them in gentle currents") delivers closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion but has paraphrase loops: "gleaming silence" appears 4× with minimal variation, and gravity descriptions repeat similar phrasing. No figurative muddle in peak beats, but syntactic monotony in chamber descent slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong opening rhythm, but climax overwrites: "cosmic threads wove... stars mirroring runes" stacks metaphors during high-pressure beat. Template cadence in ritual sequence ("He closed... began... visualized") triggers -0.5 artifact penalty. Final line resonates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.3)
    "Steam from Earl Grey mingled with aged books and wax" exemplifies multi-sensory propulsion. Zero loops; "lullaby of endurance" crystallizes accumulation. Deduct 0.1 for "patiently nimble" repetition, but it serves thematic cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor synonym churn ("ephemeral whispers"/"fleeting auroras") avoids closure impact, but "luminous ache" repetition risks overwriting. Propulsion excels in climax: "trembling hands... restructured the clock" uses strong verbs without filter clutter. Final line’s "bittersweet glow" achieves textural specificity without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with lyrical propulsion falters in the final third where "pulsing stillness" scaffold loop ("amplifying the soft strums like a heartbeat") obscures emotional immediacy; otherwise precise verbs like "reunifying" avoid overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with "brass filigree etched with interlocking gears" but figurative muddle in "shadows fled as if pursued by sun's unrelenting gaze" risks abstraction; minor scaffold in "quietly deliberate" repetitions limits 9.0 eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero closure artifacts, but adjacent-line synonym churn ("skepticism urged... But the tooth's warmth cracked open that cleft") triggers -0.2; otherwise impeccable propulsion ("Pushing through final hedge" → ritual action) and texture-specific diction ("birch splints," "herbal poultice").

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with purposeful figurative language, though "memories resurfaced" paraphrase loop (p.2, p.4) triggers -0.2. No closure-adjacent artifacts; polishing sequence avoids scaffold with concrete actions ("cloth softened by years of sea air").

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Two prose artifacts: mixed metaphor ("vulnerability wrapped... protective shroud") and template cadence ("She moved... She paused... She stopped"). Not in closure beat but prevent 9+ eligibility per penalty rules.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor synonym loops ("lucidly watchful" x3) and elevated diction ("solemnize") risk register drift but don't obscure closure. Final line's cadence ("whispers no longer closing but echoing eternally") shows masterful propulsion. Avoids peak-beat figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor synonym churn ("verdant arbor," "ancient grove") and overwriting ("dawn’s gold kissing the moon’s silver") dull propulsion. Strong closure image ("village would thrive") compensates; no critical artifacts in final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-zero scaffolding; "shattered bottles glinting like fallen ice" exemplifies textural specificity. One paraphrase loop ("patterns... mosaic... patterns") slightly muddies the ritual's mid-beat without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero scaffold/loops with high density ("tools scattered like stars on the veined floor"), but "season hung wounded" creates mixed metaphor (hanging vs. bleeding) that muddles physical logic. Final image's "bruised purples" avoids purple prose through precise textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "veined with oxidized copper that gleamed like ancient armor, curved in endless, self-similar patterns that mirrored the stars" stacks two similes, muddling physical logic. Template cadence ("She lifted... her movements... orienting it...") triggers -0.4 penalty in closure-adjacent section.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; propulsion in "kettle began its low whistle, building steam" mirrors rising tension. One paraphrase slip: "rain pattered softly" echoes "rain beading" without advancing pressure, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "dripping condensed mist" layers texture without muddle. Deducted 0.4 for "hollow ache" (diagnostic phrasing in peak beat per rubric), but propulsion remains flawless through final negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero scaffold loops; high density ("dust motes like a hesitant probe"). "Reluctant farewells" risks sentimentality but saved by concrete confetti anchor. Final line’s "steady compass" avoids cliché through prior navigation motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level propulsion falters with the intrusive meta-comment ("Wait, recount: actually, the true count aligns..."). Otherwise, high density ("petrichor nostalgia wrap around him") avoids loops. Artifact in final third disallows 9+ despite strong imagery elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "serene upheaval" repetition earns credit as patterned diction. Final image ("sundial's shadow now absent") achieves crystalline clarity, though "hindsight clarity" phrasing slightly over-tells in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "bioluminescent creatures rising" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Near-miss: "philosophical seeds" risks abstraction but redeemed by concrete decoding actions throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor overwriting in opening ("lonesome splendor where golden foliage drifted like forgotten memories") slightly dulls momentum, but no loops/scaffold. Final line ("one thread at a time") delivers crystalline propulsion. Figurative density justified by voice, though "vivid decay" borders on thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-zero loops with high density, but "bitterly sweet revelation" borders on label-speak despite immediate embodiment ("rippled through him like the palace's quake"). Final line achieves textural specificity without muddle, though one elevated phrase ("hollow echo") slightly clashes with POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless rhythm with volcanic imagery density; "gracefully alert" repetition creates subtle scaffold loop in opening beat without harming closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose soars with "resonant crack" and "phantom splashes," yet repetitive stems ("her skepticism burned luminous... her realistically imaginative nature turned") create subtle cadence loops in the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush and controlled, but "troubling serenity" repeats 4× with minimal variation, creating a paraphrase loop in high-pressure beats (nexus approach); no closure-dulling artifacts, yet density slightly obscures escalation in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor figurative muddle in "amorphous force" and slight overuse of "thundering calm" (3x); otherwise, high density ("butterflies' wings a silent thunder") propels momentum without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythmically to accelerate tension ("He was no longer in the tower"). Figurative language serves pressure ("tide pools mirrored his fractured soul"), but "searing reverie" repetition in peak beats prevents 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density with minimal scaffolding, but "tenderly organized" repeats without deepening, nudging toward synonym churn. "Elias smiled blithe as dawn’s first light crept in" leans summary-like, dulling closure’s charge. Otherwise, rhythm varies purposefully; no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line propulsion falters in reflective academia passage with synonym loops ("dismissed as dreamer... constrained resources"), slightly dulling momentum toward the crystalline closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion; "dust learned quickly" slightly anthropomorphizes but fits magical realism. Avoids scaffold—every line advances atmosphere or character—though "thistled calm" repetition borders on motif overuse in climax.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft dazzles ("sunken spires layered in silt and memory"), but "rational rebellion burned cold" contains stock metaphor string that slightly muddles physical logic mid-escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.5)
    Overwritten climax ("denoted the crescendo by subtracting final noises") with synonym churn; strong opening rhythm derailed by template cadence in unlearning sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("ruins demanded tending"/"beauty from ruins") and filter verbs ("he felt a shift") slightly dull momentum. Figurative language stays coherent, but "latent promise" risks abstraction in pivotal seed-planting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose excels in textural specificity ("powdery weight," "violet undertones mingling with briny air") with rhythmic variation, but minor register drift occurs: "inadvertently profound" and "sanctify" feel elevated for Elias’s voice. No loops or scaffold, yet one stock metaphor ("embers under ash") slightly dulls immediacy. Final line’s "hushed blaze" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Near-duplicate scaffolding ("cracked something within; now, cascading truths began to unfold") slightly dulls propulsion in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise strong density: "foxglove-stained glass ampoule" conveys toxicity and function economically. Final image ("breathed anew") avoids figurative muddle but scaffolding prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold in climax; "surgical rift" exemplifies precise propulsion. "Balancedly daring" adverb feels forced and unmotivated by voice, triggering −0.2 per patterned-artifact penalty in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    Template cadence emerges in mid-story: "daydreams sparked to life... rousing Elias from his trance; his heart quickened" demonstrates paraphrase looping (-0.4), muddling momentum without touching closure but preventing 8.8+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Near-flawless propulsion; "dread bloomed like rosewater" risks cliché but earns texture through prior anchoring. Minor cadence stumble in "recoiled, but too late" slightly dulls the melt's urgency—a hairline slip preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level density excels ("fossilized light coiled like dormant veins") but "bleak exhilaration surged through him" uses stock verb "surged" during high-pressure orb reversal. Filter-verb echo in "Elias felt it: threads snapping" costs 0.3; avoids major artifact penalties as closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.7)
    Overwriting in peak beats: "moldy cotton candy sweetness mingled with rust and something sharper, like forgotten screams" stacks metaphors violating physical logic. No template cadence, but density issues dull closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero prose artifacts; every line advances density ("barnacle hooks" eyes, "suspended cymbals" leaves). Figurative language serves the Accumulative lens—fractals mirroring clouds—without muddle. Final line’s "fractal refrain" recharges the opening’s "sapphire shards" with crystalline precision.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative language bloats key beats ("sun's merciless pound," "fracturing like flawed glass"), diluting momentum; "sunwashed dread" loops create scaffold, though final image's concision ("gate unyielding") salvages closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor overwriting ("ivy like possessive fingers" followed by "ivy’s grip") and one paraphrase loop ("noble lies... noble lies") in mid-scene. Otherwise high density: "final petal drifted down" does triple duty for time, symbol, and emotion. No closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor synonym churn ("crumbling foundations, a relic half-sunk" → "hushed blaze under moonlit ripples") in high-pressure beat. No closure artifacts, but "subdued roar" slightly muddles sensory hierarchy during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    High-propulsion prose with minimal artifacts; minor synonym churn in "reclaimed stillness" iterations and one paraphrase loop ("dappled resolve hardened... patches of certainty") prevent 9.0 despite strong closure rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with minimal scaffold: "grief clawed at his chest like thorns hidden in silk" followed by "grief folded inward" risks subtle repetition. "Luminous torment" recurs without sufficient evolution. Propulsion strong in polishing sequence, but minor synonym churn ("fractured light"/"golden fire" on tea leaves) slightly dulls closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Figurative density muddles peak beats ("intangibly tangible" repetition); final-third "unfiltered truth pooling" triggers artifact cap. Propulsion strong but scaffold in circuit-breaker descriptions dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    Density falters with "brilliant dimness" loops and near-synonym churn ("fading sunlight"/"twilight indigo"), slightly obscuring closure's emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "sky bleeding into the sea like ink in water" and closure’s "talisman of time reclaimed"; minor metaphor drift ("guilt gnawed... eroding foundations") prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold, but "alchemized into something enduring" risks purple prose in closure; rhythm varies effectively with storm intensity, though one mixed metaphor ("furrowed hush") slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero closure artifacts with strong propulsion, but "backlash of regrets" phrasing loops twice near climax; compass description avoids purple prose yet "merrily melancholic" repetition triggers -0.3 scaffold penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor synonym churn ("fresh canvas"/"clean slate seeker") and elevated diction ("delicately robust artifact") in high-pressure beats create slight register drift. Strong propulsion otherwise, but "fragile in worn leather yet enduring" loop dulls immediacy near climax.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density in ritual sequence ("crushed between palms... mingled with floral whispers"). Minor overwriting in "luminous fruit, its branches twisting like lovers' arms" slightly dulls propulsion, but closure imagery remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor overwriting in "choking beauty" repetition; otherwise flawless propulsion where "ink bled slightly into fabric" mirrors emotional rupture with zero scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor density issues in ritual description ("faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs" slightly overwrought), but propulsion remains strong with zero loops in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but stacked modifiers ("slow dance of celestial bodies—stars wheeling in silent pirouettes") risk figurative muddle in opening; final image avoids overwriting yet "gritty silk of change" slightly over-articulates the earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero scaffold loops, but opening’s "shimmered like captured starlight" overwrites high-pressure beat; minor density issue in blackout setup reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with minor scaffold: "Visions flickered... But doubt crept in" slightly paraphrases internal conflict. Elevated diction ("ethereal light stolen") risks register drift but fits mystical context. Final lines avoid overwriting—"secrets etched in star-dusted stone" charges closure cleanly. No artifacts in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion, but "furiously tranquil" and "storm-kissed wonder" risk label-repetition. Minor scaffold in "sought to understand the cartography of scars" slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion with vivid textural specificity, but minor metaphor clash ("symphony of whispers that clashed with the storm") and slight "diplomatically fierce" repetition create hairline textural muddle in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor synonym churn ("fractured glows/fractured order") and telling ("forge beauty from raw disorder") prevent 9.0. Strong propulsion in rebuilding sequences; final line avoids overwriting with concrete "garden in gravel" image.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-loop in "turning discord into hidden harmonies that surprised even the indifferent heavens" followed by similar melody phrasing; template cadence in opening "He sought... but from..." sentences. Zero artifacts in closure beat preserves high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with clean propulsion, but "luminous doubt" appears 4x early (text-artifact). Figurative muddle in "petals questioning vibrancy" slightly obscures causality; final lines ("shoot glistening") redeem with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion, but verbatim "rhythmically placid" repetition and overused "diffuse" trigger -0.3 Text Artifact Screen; no closure impact keeps it above 8.5.
