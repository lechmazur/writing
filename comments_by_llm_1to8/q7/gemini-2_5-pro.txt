  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: the dust functions as covering, lens, and final barrier. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor figurative density in the opening ("alien equation," "physical weight") is voice-consistent and does not obscure. The final beats are clean and propulsive. One small slip: "the gesture feeling less like cleaning and more like a quiet prayer" uses a simile where a concrete action might have landed harder, but it does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short crisis beats ("She didn't enter; she didn't need to") contrast with longer reflective passages. Information density is high—most lines advance both plot and theme. No loops or scaffold. Minor figurative density in opening paragraph ("ghost-heat," "maw," "fragile, cooling vessel") clusters metaphors but remains coherent. Template risk: "She learned…She sought…" parallel stems in paragraph 3, though brief and voice-motivated. Closure sentence ("The canyon was no less quiet, but now its silence was a conversation she finally understood") avoids overwriting and lands the thematic turn cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance image, stake, or internal pressure. Rhythm varies naturally; the projection sequence accelerates ("The violet deepened, swirling…") then resolves quietly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. One clarity slip: "heat-mapping emotions" as method is asserted but not explained—does the circlet read the flower's heat or Elara's projection? The circlet's "faint internal light" and "central node" read slightly gadget-catalog. "Silently expressive" and "all-consuming" are abstract high-level descriptors that could sharpen. Otherwise, prose is clean, figurative language (thermal colors) is coherent, and the final image lands without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance setting, character, or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Rhythm varies naturally. Minor overwriting in the descent: "a non-space of crushing black, the water parting before him not as a liquid, but as a tear in reality" stacks metaphors without clarifying mechanics. The closure beat is clean. One stock phrase: "his own weariness settling into a gentle, welcome calm" reads generic for the final line's emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening sentences establish urgency ("The sanctions had bled the color"), and the arbor beat slows to match ceremonial weight. Information density is high (bell etched with five-petaled lily anchors history and motive in one line). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting in "amplified quiet" and "achingly familiar" trends slightly elevated but remains voice-coherent. The final image ("gentle scrape of hoes on hard earth") recharges the opening's "hollowed cheeks" with concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the breathing sequence. Clarity is strong; no loops or scaffold in the action beats. However, figurative density in the opening and closing paragraphs borders on overwriting: "drowned thing gasping," "hollow spaces," "phantom limb," "luminous ghost," "tiny captured star," "incandescent sparks" stack without pattern-teaching, creating texture creep in non-peak beats. One paraphrase slip: "the love" and "It was everywhere" restate across adjacent lines without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or stakes. Figurative language is controlled and legible ("fading photographs projected onto a living screen," "sandpaper, grinding him down to dust"). Minor scaffold appears in a few adjacent lines restating memory dissolution without added detail, and one template stem cluster ("There was... There was..."). These do not obscure causality but prevent entry to the high 8s. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and spatial choreography (arrow→bench→panel→machines) tracks cleanly. Deductions: "chaotic jumble," "staggering grace," and "beautiful noise" are stock descriptor phrases; the phrase "dust-filled light" is a minor visual cliché. The opening "cold iron ligament" is vivid, but "profound stillness of a patiently strategic mind" edges toward telling rather than embodied perception. No paraphrase loops, but small template cadence in the machine-activation sequence (first key→second key→third key) feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly vivid ("skeletal masts clawing at a sky they could no longer sail"), but stacks in nearly every sentence during the forge climax, risking overwriting without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loop: "the silence where his father's praise should have been. The stillness in the air after a slammed door. The gaping quiet that followed..." recycles structure without added pressure. Information density is generally high; momentum carries through. Minor scaffold: "This place, like him, was a battered marvel, beautiful in its endurance" tells what the image already shows. No blocking errors; grammar clean.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.3)
    Syntax varies purposefully, information density is high, and momentum is maintained across beats. Minor loop detected: "illuminated moments" appears three times, once at setup, once mid-story, and once at closure; the recurrence is purposeful but edges toward template phrasing. One paraphrase slip: "he felt an impossible connection, a faint vibration humming a song of what was to come" and "He finally understood" in adjacent beats blur slightly. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "honeyed light" and "watery green glow" work well. No major filter-verb stacks or scaffolding. Propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and imagery is concrete (corroded pipe drip, fiery puddle, muddy precipice). The opening line anchors voice; the final image recharges the bookmark and grief motifs. However, light scaffold appears: "Her motivation was precise" is expository shorthand, and the final paragraph stacks near-synonyms ("quiet, steady trickle," "weighty lightness," "promised not to drown her, but to carry her forward") that blur the closure image's punch. No loops or major template cadence; propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies, and most sentences advance character or plot without padding. Figurative density is high in the opening third—"ghost he had programmed," "phantom limb of a past," "earthquake in my soul"—but these images cohere and avoid mixed metaphors. A paraphrase loop appears: "I was not Leo, the stunt double; I was a ghost he had programmed" / "He expected the broken puppet" recycle the construct-identity idea without new pressure. The final paragraph stacks abstractions—"stark terror," "violent, powerful certainty"—that dilute the concrete image of the seashell and sirens. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks harm momentum; information density is solid overall.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high, with most lines advancing atmosphere or ritual progression. Two persistent issues: "ambered hush" and "marbled hush" function as near-synonyms without clear functional distinction, creating mild conceptual redundancy. Additionally, the phrasing "He felt the silence" repeats across two adjacent sentences ("He felt the silence left by... He felt the taut pause"), a paraphrase loop that slightly flattens momentum in a key passage. Figurative language is dense ("wind was a blade," "diamond stud in... velvet," "dying embers") but mostly coherent and purposeful. The closure beat is clean, with the final image landing clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance concept, character state, or world logic. Rhythm varies purposefully—longer complex sentences during reflection, shorter declaratives at the climax ("It was not a memory of the procedure, or of a life before. It was simpler, more profound"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled: "ghost impressions," "node," "cascade of error warnings" all serve clarity. Minor overwriting in "a thousand tiny, fractured rainbows" (three modifiers) and "achingly familiar" (adverb + stock phrase). The final image—"It stood alone in the quiet dark, the snow undisturbed at its feet"—delivers propulsion and resonance without ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful, but density issues accumulate: "the dense, ringing silence" and "the crystal whispering expanse" are abstract constructions that slow momentum without adding concrete pressure. Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines ("He yearned to thaw the frost" / "he no longer knew the shape of honest words" restate the same obstacle). The final paragraph stacks declarations ("The mistrust did not vanish," "he felt the first delicate thaw," "freed by an honesty") that tell rather than show the shift. Filter verbs ("He saw her," "He watched as she sketched") cluster in the park beat without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Clarity and concision are strong overall. Two deductions: "a man as gnarled and weathered as the ancient wisteria he tended" opens with a stock simile, and "the world had changed since the Decisive Decade" is scaffolding that could compress. The phrase "landscape of blooming, withering grace" in the penultimate sentence stacks metaphor at a quiet beat without clear vehicle logic. Minor filter-verb clusters ("began to polish," "felt like") appear but do not pervade. No loops or synonym churn; propulsion is steady. Paragraph structure varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally dense and propulsive with strong imagery ("continent-sized lepidoptera," "icy warmth," "falling sideways"). Some minor scaffolding: "This was the hush" and "It was one of the most subdued awakenings imaginable" front-load commentary rather than trusting the image. The phrase "a mechanically warm and deeply resonant truth" in the climax is slightly abstract and repeats the motif label rather than letting the image speak. Rhythm varies well; no loops or template cadence. One paraphrase near the end ("he knew that his understanding…re-calibrated forever" restates the vertigo moment) costs ~0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clear and propulsive with good sensory anchoring. However, several artifacts reduce density: "a dark, silent companion" and "skeletal ribs" feel stock; "heart hammering" is cliché; "the hush of unstruck chords" repeats verbatim as a frame without evolution. Template cadence appears in early exposition ("It was a place caught in between spaces: between its gilded past and watery grave, between sound and a silence..."). The climactic beat where the melody emerges is vivid and earns its elevation, preventing deeper penalty. Paragraph rhythm varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, and stakes). Figurative language (auroral sorrow, indigestible stone, waveform collapse) is controlled and integrated, though "auroral" recurs three times, risking mild over-reliance. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity remains high even under metaphorical load. Minor deduction: "the swallowed truth wasn't in the smudge, but in the smudging" borders on explicating the implicit, though it's scaled to closure and earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong rhythm control: "rotted tie," "oily water," "weeping walls," "bone-deep, earned exhaustion." Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. Minor template cadence in the middle: "The air grew thick… and the clang was joined by…" followed by "I kept the radio on… I used the calls as…" creates slight repetition of structure. No paraphrase loops. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("devouring dark," "sleeping iron beasts"). The final beat—"deep, peaceful emptiness" contrasted with "charged, accusatory silence"—lands cleanly with no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is largely clean with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, several phrases approach stock metaphor territory: "symphony of seawater and screams," "unending noise," "healing emptiness." The phrase "the clamor...all ceased" followed by "There was only the profound, healing emptiness" loops conceptually. Minor filter-verb stacking in the opening paragraph ("I had started to grip," "once a comfort, was crumbling") slightly dulls immediacy. The piece avoids major artifacts but leans on elevated diction that occasionally tilts toward generality rather than sharp particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several patterns recur: "His [noun] was [adjective]" scaffolds appear three times in the opening third ("His client," "His own motivation," "His therapeutic method"). The eclipse description—"bruised twilight," "ethereal glow," "ghostly ring of fire"—stacks modifiers without fresh sensory grounding. Two paraphrase loops: paragraph 3's "simple, looping melody" and "coax the quiet from the stones" restate "gentle, resonant sound" from the prior beat; final paragraph's "he had not healed her, not truly" and "he had helped her link" restate the same thematic claim. Apply −0.6 for template stems and loops, no closure touch.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong word choice ("bronze quiet," "dreaming-well," "archivist of the ache"). The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, the phrase "a form of pure imagination his generation could no longer conceive of" is slightly redundant with surrounding context, and "frantic emotion that had guided it" leans abstract. Rhythm varies well; no major loops or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the opening and closing paragraphs, though the middle beats summarize the fortune-writing without showing tactical friction. Figurative language appears frequently ("ghostly metronome," "net of suggestion and coincidence," "silent chord") and some vehicles mix registers. No loops or scaffolding clutter the text. The final image ("stepping out into the damp air not as a conductor, but as a traveler") lands cleanly with syntactic control. Mild overwriting in metaphor density across high-pressure beats does not obscure causality but reduces sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with high information density: "He did not decorate with icons or relics; he decorated with silence, carving it into the air with the careful pauses between his heartbeats" layers sensory, philosophical, and character work in one beat. Sentence variety supports the exorcism's escalation, and figurative language (the loop pedal as "small red eye," the gray as "anchor of its own") remains coherent. Minor friction: "a texture within it" and "muffled clarity" border on abstract; "the unraveled stillness began there, in that manufactured imperfection" tells the turning point rather than letting the stutter fully dramatize it. No template cadence or loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high: "The glass spire was a needle stitching the dark sky to the frozen lake" does triple duty (setting, metaphor, mood). Sentence rhythm varies and paragraphs breathe purposefully. Two frictions lower the score: paraphrase loops appear ("He was not merely remembering; he was reverse-engineering a soul" restates the mapping project without new pressure), and figurative language clusters densely in some high-pressure beats ("texture in the silence," "sustained, foundational note") without always advancing causality. The final fortune slips are scaffold-like closures that recap theme rather than propelling the ending image. Overall clarity remains high, but the closure beat carries some thematic redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythm and strong verbs ("defier," "lurched," "crystallized"). The opening paragraph anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, figurative density is high in the first third without always adding pressure: "fallen star" droplets and "sterile, unblinking eye of a warden" cluster decoratively. Two instances of paraphrase loop: paragraph 3 restates that the tablet is "not a map, but a codex" after establishing it, and paragraph 4's "dwindling resource" / "creep higher" restate despair without advancing knowledge. Template cadence in paragraph 5: three consecutive sentences open with subject-verb-object construction ("He ignored," "The procedure was," "He had always"). These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum mid-story, preventing entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and controlled with strong sensory specificity: "drum maker's cavern," "jagged tip that had scratched out the last song," "the deep, resonant thrumming in her own chest." Information density is high. However, multiple lines loop or restate: "It was not the clumsy void of deafness, but a structured, resonant silence, a tapestry woven from vibrations" is immediately followed by similar abstract claims. "Mirrored hush" appears three times without evolving function. Paraphrase loop penalty (−0.2) and template cadence in the audience-reaction paragraph ("A man... began to weep... A woman wrapped her arms") apply (−0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Syntax varies effectively: the opening's long cartographic metaphor contrasts the short beats in the final paragraph. Information density is high—every line advances character or plot. Figurative language is controlled: "pressure system centered squarely on him" extends the storm metaphor without overwriting. Minor frictions: "possessed of a credibly curious nature" is slightly scaffoldy, and "the storm-that-wasn't" repeats the phantom-storm idea within two lines. The phrase "disparate data points resolved into a perfect, predictive curve" risks elevated diction but stays within a meteorologist's lexicon. No loops or major template cadence; propulsion is strong through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor well. Information density is high in the confrontation sequence. Minor issues: "It is a form of poetry" and the subsequent stanza metaphor restate rather than advance; "passionate subtlety" as "subtle, rising tide" reads label-driven. "The being simply pulsed, waiting" is efficient. The rope's return is purposeful, not looped. Figurative language (heat haze, starlight tapestry) is mostly clear, though "answer that was also a question" and "endlessly repeated page" lean abstract at the closure beat without full sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high with minimal scaffold; most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully: the opening uses longer, weighted sentences that shift to shorter, active syntax during the playing sequence. Minor deduction for one paraphrase loop: "It was a ritual of magnificent simplicity, a reminder that..." followed by similar construction. One register drift: "acoustic perceptive was less a gift than a condition" reads slightly clinical for the established voice. The final image—water drop as symphony—demonstrates strong propulsion and closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; sentences consistently do multiple jobs. Rhythm varies purposefully: longer, layered sentences during preparation compress into shorter bursts during the transfer. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent: "miniature storm of memory," "damp silk," "flower without roots." One minor slip: "The transformation was complete, not in the petal, but in him" reads slightly explanatory after the embodied work has already shown this shift. Overwriting check: the density of metaphor is high but remains legible and voice-consistent; the grotto's "soft, internal luminescence" and similar phrases cluster but do not muddle causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "silent contributors" and "quiet dedication" appear multiple times without added pressure, and "cautious exuberance" is repeated verbatim across paragraphs. The metaphor "tears...transforming it into something brilliant" is generic and lacks specificity. The final paragraph over-explains the closure ("a worthy investment in a cycle that would now play on") where the image alone would carry more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies; sentences breathe with the orchard's glow and quicken during the search. "His motivation was a simple, desperate need for the warmth of the we, not the cold solitude of the I" reads slightly elevated for the POV but carries thematic weight. Minor scaffold: "He knew the secrets of forgotten places" tells what the prior beat showed. "Boldly sympathetic, his empathy a force that pushed him" stacks near-synonyms. The final paragraph's "luminescent ache had not vanished, but it had transformed" loops the opening's "luminescent ache" without adding new pressure. No closure-touching artifacts; deductions stay within the non-closure cap.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully: short beats during the arrhythmia ("One beat, then two, then a jarring silence"), longer syntax during the corrective act. Minor loop detected: "interrupted cadence" appears three times across paragraphs 2, 4, and 7, with partial paraphrase in the final reflection. Template cadence in paragraph 6: "He had to... He had to... He needed to..." (three consecutive imperative stems) flattens momentum before the climax. Figurative language is controlled ("frost flowers," "cathedral-like structure") without overwriting. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts are purposeful. The phrase "sculpts time itself" (paragraph 3) is a high-register descriptor that risks abstraction but remains anchored in the creature's visible action.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with strong information density: most sentences advance character, ritual mechanics, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies across the piece. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final image recharges the seedling/growth motif. Two minor artifacts lower the score: "an unsolved equation that had unbalanced the world" (metaphor drift: grief isn't literally an equation) and slight filter-verb stacking in paragraph three ("believed," "sought," "had to dovetail") that could be tightened. No loops or paraphrase cycles. The lattice description avoids purple prose while remaining vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence variety and rhythm are strong ("This was his time, the liminal space..."). Information density is high (outage context, Elias's ability, fragment backstory folded efficiently). Minor issues: "quiet click of satisfaction" and "sapphire hush" recur without reweighting; "a patient archaeology of the building's hidden skeleton" is slightly elevated for the beat. One paraphrase loop: "nestled in a bed of desiccated silverfish and grit" and "tiny piece of obsolete technology" restate the fragment's fragility. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. "The mossy trellis, slick and dark after the rain, looked like the skeleton of some great beast that had finally collapsed" delivers texture and thematic weight. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor density slip: "The realization struck him not like lightning, but like the slow, quiet dawn that follows a storm" is a functional metaphor but slightly generic given the established storm imagery. The scaffold phrase "he told himself, for his study" in the leaf-pocketing beat is efficient self-deception rather than artifact. Zero filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "salt-crusted memories" conveys setting, tone, and backstory in three words). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at the discovery and slowing at the exchange. Minor template cadence in the opening paragraph ("trying to wring," "trying to capture") and one paraphrase loop ("desperate need to translate" / "the story the object held") apply −0.3 total. No figurative muddle; metaphors (grain/chaff, predator/companion) are coherent and pay off. Sentence openings vary; paragraph structure supports beats.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or pressure. Rhythm varies with paragraph length and syntax. Minor template cadence in the opening ("had seen," "had felt," "had not seen") and some paraphrase loops ("her own obsolescence" / "a purpose she had misunderstood") slightly dull momentum. The phrase "bright darkness, a profound mystery that wasn't menacing, but illuminating" stacks contradictions without full clarity. No egregious artifacts in closure beats. Figurative language (cave pearl, overlapping shadows) is coherent and grounded. Opening anchors voice; final line recharges the cave's song motif with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift ("Kaelen knelt," "She peered," "He was not just"). Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction for one mildly elevated phrase in peak moment: "another fragment delivered, connecting a piece of metal to a moment of failed heroism and final, desperate love" stacks modifiers where simpler syntax might sharpen. Otherwise clean propulsion and no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; imagery is vivid ("floor of dark, polished stone that seemed to swallow the light"). Minor scaffold appears: "trembling certainty" recurs three times with minimal evolution, and "his only mentor" / "the old man" alternate as near-synonyms across adjacent paragraphs. The final paragraph shifts into summary mode ("the dare had not been a challenge…") rather than sustaining scene pressure, which dulls the closure image slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening anchors voice and stakes, final line recharges whale song motif with cost. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot without padding. Minor template cadence in paragraph three: "He spent two days… He listened… He tried… The numbers…" runs parallel stems across four sentences, triggering slight mechanical feel but not enough to obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or stock metaphor strings; the storm vortex image and "cataloging ghosts" carry specificity. Proofreading clean.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and several images are strong ("celestial flowers," "hole in the concept of somewhere"). Clarity is mostly solid. However, multiple metaphoric constructs lean abstract without full grounding: "spatial mutiny" as "rebellion of distance," "the weary chain of cause and effect," "the only adventure left." Filter verbs appear but do not stack heavily. A paraphrase loop exists: "It was not a hole to somewhere else; it was a hole in the concept of 'somewhere.' It was an absence, a negation" restates the same idea three ways without added pressure. Minor scaffold phrasing ("This was the moment," "This was the power source") trends formulaic. Overall density is good but figurative language occasionally prioritizes sound over concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line clarity is strong; rhythm varies appropriately. High information density: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor loop detected: "calculus" / "equation" / "mathematics" / "cosmic ledger" recur across paragraphs without new meaning each time—acceptable thematic motif but edges toward synonym churn. "Deathly vitality" and "predatory stillness" are fresh. One template-cadence run: "She worked… applying… chilling… coaching…" in paragraph five uses parallel -ing stems, but the effect fits the procedural moment and does not obscure causality. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance her method, the world's silence, or the specific texture she seeks. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the ritual's pacing. No loops or synonym churn detected. Minor figurative density in the closure paragraph ("ghost of an aquatic spectacle breaking against the shore of the present") is coherent and voice-motivated. The phrase "cool, sterile light" and "nascent sunlight" are precise. One scaffold moment: "Her motivation was a quiet, desperate hunger" tells what the following action shows, but it's brief and doesn't obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives in paragraph one, longer accumulative structures during the layering beat). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense ("iron labyrinth," "ghost haunting the caesura," "throbbing with the lives I've curated") but mostly coherent. One mixed metaphor: "caesura" (a metrical pause) applied to tide rhythm reads strained. The color metaphors ("vibrant…violet," "warm gold") risk cliché but remain voice-motivated. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor overwriting in the peak beat ("The violet of grief and the warm gold of that remembered touch") where two abstractions stack without embodied action. The prose is polished and propulsive but the density of elevated diction in a high-pressure moment and one metaphor strain prevent 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high—most lines advance character, action, or atmosphere. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line ("note by resonant note") recharges the "universe sings" motif. Minimal scaffold or loops; one minor paraphrase slip: "he was no longer just a myth buster debunking flimsy claims; he was a restorer" could compress further. Figurative language is purposeful ("monotone prayer to physics," "needle of light") without overwriting. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: workbench, seashell, cello, room center, corner floor. No pronoun confusion or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or stakes. Figurative language ("tidal wave of corporate order," "vibrant, chaotic skin") is vivid but occasionally stacks without clear pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in the second paragraph ("He felt...A part of him...But the orderly part") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("he hadn't saved...but he had given") slightly flatten momentum. No major loops or scaffolding; the opening and closing lines anchor well. Syntax and clarity remain strong throughout, though one or two transitions lean expository.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with strong sensory specificity and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("light...sliced across the summit like a blade," "ghostly garden") is vivid and controlled. Two minor drags: "a quiet rebellion, fueled by a deep and purposefully curious ache" stacks modifiers in the opening, and "magic was gone, replaced by the sterile, unforgiving light" offers a stock closure phrase. Information density is high and rhythm varies effectively under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high, with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. Minor scaffold appears: "It was the massive freighter's maiden voyage" feels expository after the dialogue already conveyed urgency. "Here was her true sight" is slightly over-explanatory. The phrase "jarring, asymmetrical ripples told her" uses a mild filter construction but remains voice-appropriate. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is purposeful but dense in places: "jewel waiting for its fire," "dissonant, painful thrum," "shimmering membrane"—three metaphors in quick succession mid-story without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is controlled with strong rhythm and clarity. Imagery is vivid without overwriting ("feathery lines of frost," "starlike point"). Information density is high—each sentence advances character, world, or pressure. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent explanation: the paragraph beginning "It was a map" explains what was just shown visually, creating slight redundancy. The final sequence gains momentum effectively, and technical vocabulary (spectrograph, barometric pressure) is accurate and voice-appropriate. No significant loops or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is clean, with no grammar or punctuation errors. However, multiple artifacts cluster: "infinitely patient" appears twice verbatim, "the ebony tuning fork" is named redundantly, and template stems recur ("He raised… He struck… He walked… He turned"). The phrase "ghost town revival" in the final paragraph reads as prompt echo. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching ("sculptor of echoes," "spectral imprint," "symphony of countless small movements"), and some constructions veer purple ("drinking the faint light of the bruised twilight sky"). Penalties total approximately −1.0 in Q7 for loops and density without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and the opening/closing images are strong. Clarity is maintained through complex action. Deductions: minor template cadence in the middle ("I felt...tasted...heard") and one paraphrase loop ("ignore the phantom pain" / "ignored the...instinctual terror"). The phrase "lonesome splendor" in the final third reads slightly elevated/ornamental relative to the prior register. No loops touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense and controlled with strong figurative language ("a rusted iron needle stitching," "a pocket of absolute quiet," "amber light"). Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high. Minor deductions: "I was motivated to thread this labyrinth with your own story" contains a POV slip ("your" instead of "my") and awkward phrasing. Some metaphors approach overwriting in adjacent sentences (copperlight repose, shadows holding breath, salt air failing to erode sorrows) without full pattern-teaching, though the effect supports tone. No loops or scaffold; sequence clarity is maintained. The final line propels cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings shift, and paragraph structure supports the accumulative build. Information density is high in the memory sequences and the final transference. However, several elevated phrasings feel overwritten for the pressure level: "ashen-veil ghost bride," "ephemeral cameo appearances," "lovingly venomous," "mournful elation," "spectral executor," "obsidian horizon" cluster in adjacent lines without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating a decorative density (−0.4 to −0.6 range). The opening "alchemical orchard greenhouse existed in a bubble of glass against a tapestry of endless night" front-loads metaphor before establishing tactile grounding. Minor filter-verb use ("felt a presence," "seemed to pull") is voice-motivated and does not stack heavily. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity and concision hold across most beats.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor figurative density in early paragraphs ("bone-white memories," "captured sky," "orchid solace") stays controlled and voice-motivated, though "orchid solace" reads slightly forced. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. One slight register drift: "collective unconscious effort" leans academic in an otherwise lyric register. Clarity and propulsion remain strong through the storm climax. Zero major artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; no scaffold loops. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or thematic weight. Figurative language (silver vein, slow-motion embrace, roots as testament) is coherent and earned. Minor friction: "a mixture of life and decay that fostered a cautious enchantment within her" leans slightly expository when the sensory catalog has already shown it. Proofreading is clean; no pronoun ambiguity or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the chalk-encoding beat. Minor overwriting in the opening: "monoliths of silent gold," "ephemeral data streams" stack figurative language without pattern-teaching. One paraphrase loop: "He looked from the silent, waiting machines to the empty concrete plaza" recaps spatial awareness already established. Filter verbs ("he believed," "he was creating") appear in reflective beats but remain voice-motivated. No template cadence or major scaffold. Clarity holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with longer meditative beats ("Her method was not one of logic...") contrasting against the tight action sequence at the terminal. Information density is high; nearly every line advances situation or atmosphere. The piece avoids major loops, though "echoed silence" and variants ("silent symphony," "screamed with silence") recur without always adding new pressure. "Ghost-stitch" and "thread of the wrong color" are fresh metaphors that serve the embroidery motif. One template cadence appears in the conspiracy-fragment paragraph: "She pictured...She saw...Each possibility felt..."—three parallel stems in close succession. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, so the deduction remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly controlled: "air...as thick as an unsent letter's ink," "low tide" energy. Two minor loops: "key turns in the condensation" restated as "words began to form" without added pressure; "shattering understanding" echoes "broken sound" within three lines. Template cadence appears in the spirits' song description ("murmur to a low, keening hymn"). Propulsion is steady; no artifacts touch the closure beat. Information density is high, though some phrases ("painful, luminous truth") verge on stock elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; information density is high in the decryption sequence. Two minor issues: "It was a dense, physical knot of memory he could never quite unpick" and the immediately following "His life's work was to find the sense in the noise, to build bridges" form a subtle paraphrase loop, restating Elias's decoder role. "Lotus-hearted ache" registers as slightly elevated diction in a peak beat. Both artifacts appear outside the closure beat, so accumulation cap applies: −0.8 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short bursts during the painting sequence, longer periods in reflection), and information density is high: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or conflict. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is disciplined: "exposed film" and "phantom limb" are specific and earn their keep. Minor overwriting in the opening third: "bolt of grey silk," "frozen lightning," and "light-saturated negative" cluster densely without the pattern being fully taught until later. The final paragraph compresses closure cleanly without scaffold. No grammar or continuity errors detected.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or layer meaning. Rhythm modulates appropriately (urgency during shifts, contemplation during cataloging). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Opening and closing lines are purposeful. Deductions: "bewitch" and derivatives appear four times, creating mild lexical redundancy at key transitions. "The bewitching was absolute, a silent implosion of potential" stacks elevated metaphor in a peak beat without adding clarity. "Lifetime of awakenings" in the penultimate paragraph is summary-tell where compression would serve better.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, figurative language clusters without clear payoff: "daggers wrapped in silk," "spectral orchid," "mind-bending tone," "monstrous" orchid. The phrase "converging chaos" appears twice in close proximity without tonal justification. Paraphrase loop: "stand guard over your own spark of defiance" is thematically restated in the final line's "spark burning brightly." The neologism "chronophage fungus" and "neuro-electric field" read as placeholder tech-speak rather than grounded world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is mostly controlled, with variation in sentence length and structure. Information density is high—nearly every line advances Elara's interior arc or the acoustic motif. However, figurative language saturates many beats without always adding pressure: "phantom limb of the soul," "reef-shadow joy," "sand grinding into a pearl" pile metaphor on metaphor in quick succession, risking overwriting in the middle passage. A paraphrase loop appears when "the pain did not lessen, but its texture shifted" is immediately followed by similar restatement ("familiar torment…started to feel less like a cage"). The final paragraph is clean and propulsive, and no template cadence or filter-verb stacks harm momentum, but the density of metaphor in peak beats reduces clarity slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with many lines doing double duty (the cracked tube's fracture both describes and symbolizes damaged trust). However, multiple sentences across the piece share template cadence and elevated register: "His work was...," "His destination...," "His motivation...," "His action was..." creates a formulaic stem pattern that flattens propulsion. Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence in the climax beat carries metaphor ("spectral harmony," "alchemy of sound and sorrow," "foxglove regret")—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, bordering on overwriting. Minor clarity issue: "across the museum of extinct feelings" in paragraph four reads as spatial motion but means temporal/conceptual reach.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance magic system, stakes, or emotional state. Rhythm varies appropriately—longer, complex sentences during explanation compress to shorter beats at the manifestation ("For a heart-stopping second, nothing happened. Then..."). Minor scaffold appears: "The silence was broken, replaced by a fragile, resonant chord of hope" restates what the hand-reach already showed. Some figurative density in peak beats: "silent music," "luminous harmony," "fragile, transparent beauty" stack metaphors without always clarifying. Clarity remains intact, but the final paragraph edges toward slight overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template-cadence runs or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high in the puzzle sequence (adhesive → pollen/azurite → chain cipher). Clarity holds throughout; spatial choreography and prop states (envelope, box, chain, stone cavity) track cleanly. Minor overwriting: "His father's act felt slyly heartfelt" and "a compassion so deep it had chosen the guise of severity" edge into abstract phrasing where concrete image would sharpen. Figurative language (pressure/release motif, "geologic sighs") is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; opening sentences establish lyric texture. Information density is high in the storm sequence. Clarity is consistent. Minor artifacting: "This was his ritual, his method" and "This had become their own ritual" create a light paraphrase loop around the word "ritual." The meteorite beat—"'A good luck charm,' he lied, the words tasting like ash"—is strong, embodied craft. The final phrase on the scroll is somewhat on-the-nose but does not obscure causality. No major loops or scaffold drag.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies well; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—nearly every line advances understanding or pressure. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding. Grammar and punctuation are clean. Figurative language is purposeful (prism shards, fractured hush, white gateway). Minor deductions: "The fractured hush deepened" in the penultimate move relies on the opening metaphor without fresh sensory anchoring at the peak beat, risking a slight echo rather than escalation. "Calm, silver void" and "soft, pervasive light" in the final paragraph are serviceable but slightly abstract for the closure image; one concrete sensory detail (texture, temperature, sound) would lift propulsion. Overall strong with minor slips that do not touch the core closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies well; opening long sentence contrasts with later fragments. Some overwriting: "a world of shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite from the oppressive dark" stack modifiers in peak beats. Minor paraphrase loop: "forgotten city" appears twice in opening, and "crushing pressure/isolation" echoes. The phrase "unshed tears and newfound understanding" uses stock coupling. Information density is generally high, but "It was his anchor to a past he could no longer inhabit and a constant prod towards finding a new one" tells what the feather means rather than showing its use.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and strong specificity ("tear-drop shaped shard," "tiny, like grains of polished sand"). The climax sequence propels clearly: glass pressed → blinding light → truth revealed. However, minor loops appear: "memory was weakening" / "vines began to recede" restate the same urgency without adding pressure. The phrase "a living map" and "the memory's anchor" edge toward stock metaphor. Template cadence in the seed-sprouting beat: "They trickled water… and with a soft chiming sound, the seeds began to sprout" uses scaffolding rhythm. Information density is high overall, though the final paragraph summarizes theme rather than trusting the image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("silver tongue licking," "conductor's baton," "phantom warmth"). Two small loops: "His motivation was simple" followed by "His method was always the same" (adjacent thesis statements); "a still point" / "silent observer" recur without added pressure. Template cadence in the setup paragraphs ("He watched… He saw… He walked… He placed…") slightly dulls momentum. No major opacity, but density in the middle third crowds the causal chain. Final image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.9)
    Density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or character state. Rhythm varies purposefully. However, several figurative constructions in the anchoring beat border on overwriting: "spontaneously anchored," "the garden's unmoving center," "stars…within him," "cool, dark fire," "pinpoint of perfect shadow" cluster without clear physical grounding. The fledging metaphor in the final paragraph ("bird…breaking the shell…ache and surge of new feathers") stacks vehicle upon vehicle, risking mixed-metaphor muddle. No loops or scaffold, but the elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("translation whose tongue could not quite form the final, crucial word").

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse; information density is high. The pond beat is propulsive and clear. However, minor overwriting appears: "noctilucent reckonings of a long, sleepless night" stacks modifiers without added clarity, and "the way the faint dawn light caught on their crests and deepened in their troughs" edges toward ornamental description. "His hands, calloused from cutting glass but gentle in their purpose" is filter-heavy. No loops or major artifacts touch closure, keeping the score solid mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies naturally; strong opening and closing images. Information density is high in the backstory sequence. Minor scaffold: "Elias had taken the agony of a single moment and, through quiet reflection, had turned it into a map for the path ahead" summarizes rather than showing the transformation in action. "Hard softness" in "the hard softness in his mentor's soul" feels slightly forced. Some figurative density in descriptors ("silver-and-charcoal skeletons," "velvet black") but coherent. No loops or template cadence; pronoun references clear.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and information density is high (gauge function, pattern mechanics, tidal catalyst compressed efficiently). A few lines carry near-paraphrase: "a serene upheaval" and "The tone of the place shifted, the quiet calm charged with an immense, silent power" restate the same tonal shift. Stock metaphors appear ("weaving itself into the fabric," "composed a new stanza in its song") without fresh grounding. Figurative language is dense in the final paragraph ("stanza," "puzzle," "theorem of optimism") without pattern-teaching, and "lucidly watchful" recurs as a label. No major loops, but slight template cadence in action beats ("She knelt, her fingers sorting"; "Elara retreated…her eyes fixed").

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The air was thick with the scent of moss and the memory of rain" establishes atmosphere and temporal layering). The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor texture debt: "charted" recurs four times in slight paraphrase (charted acoustics, charted before, charting tools, chart and move on), creating subtle synonym drift that does not obscure clarity but reduces freshness. No scaffold loops or figurative muddle; propulsion is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("shattering it into a thousand liquid rainbows," "melody that few would recognize and none would understand"). However, elevated diction pervades nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or stress modulation, trending toward overwriting in a high-pressure beat: "the notes weaving into a melody," "fractured light spilling," "slivers of color as if they were a silent orchestra." One paraphrase loop: "the magic found its targets" immediately followed by three mirror vignettes that repeat structure (someone sees X, then sees Y instead). Template cadence in the vignettes (In X, Y saw…) triggers a −0.4 deduction. Information density is high; no scaffold or typos.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. The opening image ("marble beneath his worn boots cracked like a shattered promise") and the dust-sigil sequence are vivid and propulsive. However, several phrases carry mild overwriting: "a palpable force in the quiet air," "the flawed beauty of the scene was breathtaking," and the metaphor "the moment was fraying, the fragile consensus threatening to dissolve back into the familiar comfort of war" stacks abstractions during a high-pressure beat. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the elevated diction in the climax ("a silence that seemed to stretch into eternity") slightly dilutes momentum. Grammar and sequencing are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances character, world, or pressure. Figurative language is vivid and coherent ("mineral ghost of the ocean," "calligraphy of cracks," "fractured his iron resolve") without overwriting. Minor deduction: "To the world, Elias Vance was the water baron..." is expository scaffolding that could anchor more tightly in present stimulus, and "They did not know he dreamed of birdsong" tells what a sensory memory beat could show. The dissolution sequence is propulsive and imagistic with no loops. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies across the piece and the opening anchors voice effectively, but clusters of elevated figurative language—"stanza of perfect control," "spectral residue," "lattice of crystal…spun from salvaged starlight and frozen tears"—accumulate without pattern-teaching, creating a decorative density that slows the rite's momentum (overwriting penalty −0.5). The penultimate paragraph contains paraphrase loops: "untangling threads" is restated as "tangled skein" and "unwound the spiritual afflictions," reiterating method without added pressure (−0.3). Filter-verb reliance is moderate ("seemed to breathe," "seemed to hold") but does not cluster enough to trigger the stack penalty. Information density is high in setup but thins during the rite, where summary replaces scene action.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high with purposeful detail throughout. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately, accelerating through the argument memory and slowing for the closure decision. Minor issues: "This was his work, his core obsession" is mildly expository; "the first true stars of the evening" contains a small redundancy with "evening" and "twilight" already established. The metaphor density in the final paragraph approaches but doesn't cross into overwriting. "Baton being passed back to himself" is conceptually clear but slightly strained. No loops or template cadence; clarity remains strong. One small proofreading note: "exquisitely jointed marionettes" and later "pale, limbless bodies" creates a minor tension in the trunk description.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("fragile chain linking his signals," "brief shadow falling across his hands"). Information density is high; most lines advance scene or atmosphere. Minor decorative drift: "a great, flowing river of orange he had read about in old texts" and "the vast, indifferent sky" lean on stock phrasing. "Blushing stillness" appears twice in identical form, the second use at closure ("the blushing stillness returning") a near-loop rather than reweighting. No major loops or scaffolding; figurative language is controlled. Overall propulsion is steady but the ending softens into summary-adjacent reflection ("his own quiet cadence") rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the craft sequence. Minor scaffold appears: "the snowmelt ardor cresting into a quiet sea of fulfillment" stacks metaphors without full coherence (snowmelt/sea), and "technically gentle" recurs decoratively. "As if in answer" and "the sanctum held its breath" veer toward stock phrasing. No major loops or template cadence, but figurative density in non-peak beats (aurora as timepiece, rope as voice) slightly dilutes propulsion without teaching a pattern that pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Minor loop: "precisely playful and maddeningly obscure" and "a game, a riddle" restate without adding pressure. The figurative language is controlled but dense in the dream sequence ("spun light," "moth's wing," "ozone and forgotten starlight")—borderline overwriting but remains legible. No major scaffolding or template cadence. Sentence openings vary.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies well; sentence openings shift; figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Information layering is strong in the ritual sequence. Weaknesses: "hollowed-out days" and "encrypted devotion" read as stock literary phrases; "clawed at the violet sky" is a near-cliché. The phrase "a prospect that always felt empirically ironic to him" tells the irony rather than dramatizing it through hesitation or contradictory micro-action. Minor paraphrase: "no thunderclap, no blinding flash" followed immediately by describing what *did* happen reads as setup-payoff but edges toward redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean, with strong vocabulary ("soundless sanctuary," "sympathetic agony"). Some scaffold phrases recur: "the entity," "the nature of shifting grace," "the core concept" appear multiple times without added pressure. Template cadence is visible in the middle section: "She presented… She did not speak… She broadcasted… She focused…" runs four paragraphs with identical stems. No loops or muddles touch the closure beat. Information density is moderate; some sentences restate prior content ("Her purpose was singular" / "Her plan began").

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines advance image, character, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully, tightening during the breathing sequence ("Inhale... Exhale...") and opening at closure. Minor loop: "The fog was a soft, grey wall" / "the fog had stolen it, had seeped into his mind" restates fog-as-threat without new pressure. A few filter verbs in non-peak beats ("She believed," "She would not simply retrieve") dull immediacy slightly but do not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops in the climactic beat; the fracture and her response remain propulsive and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (ribbon, seed, crystal mechanics compressed efficiently). Clarity holds across spatial choreography and the wrap/planting sequence. Minor loop: "his tools—the resonant chisel, the harmonic mallet" then "Setting aside his tools" recycles the anchor without added pressure. Template cadence appears in mid-story reflection: "He had been trying to… when all he had needed to do…" reads slightly formulaic. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Propulsion is steady; the final image recharges the ribbon motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is largely clear and propulsive with strong imagery: "ghost-silver branches," "miniature nebulae," "night-fused flower." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. Minor issues: "brightened disquiet" appears twice in near-identical phrasing, creating a small loop; "the cool, solid reality of it" is somewhat generic; and "a profound sense of awe settled over his anxiety, polishing it to a gleam" borders on overwriting with the polishing metaphor. The breakthrough paragraph employs effective parallelism ("not because...but because") that clarifies the revelation. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "stitched together from temporal paradoxes," "beings woven from ink and memory," "ghosts from the catalog," "staircase of woven roots and softly glowing pages." While vivid, the metaphoric saturation in nearly every sentence risks overwriting without always propelling. Some paraphrase loops: "rustle of vellum and scent of decaying paper" / "air growing still and heavy" echo texture without advancing. "Her purpose here had always been academic" / "Her true goal" within two paragraphs. Rhythm varies but several beats lean on "she [verb]" stems. No severe artifacts touch closure, but density and template cadence patterns lower momentum mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("fog...a shroud," "memories alter and reform like the fog"), but several metaphors clash or overreach: "unkindled solace" personifies an abstraction awkwardly, and "trapped freedom" as a descriptor never quite resolves its contradiction on the page. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "She raised...She moved...She used...She pulled" across four beats without syntactic variation. The final paragraph recovers with strong propulsion ("Her purpose was not to recapture...but to give voice"), but the scaffold remains visible. Minor paraphrase loop: "shifting sea" in paragraph two echoes "warped deck...drifting" in paragraph one without added detail.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density. Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Minor issues: "the scent of old paper and beeswax a comforting balm against the temporal anomaly ticking away above him" uses "balm against" somewhat abstractly, and "careful removal, of realities neatly folded and filed away" is faintly stock. The weaving sequence is concrete and specific. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. One figurative phrase ("chord played on an instrument that had yet to be invented") in a high-pressure beat doesn't obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual momentum. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or ritual mechanics. Minor overwriting: "gently luminous" appears twice in similar contexts; "hammered repose" (opening) and "earned repose" (closing) risk paraphrase-loop without sufficient transformation. "Symphony of nullity" and "textured presence of peace" carry slight figurative muddle in high-pressure beats. No template cadence or filter stacks; propulsion is clear and causality legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is strong; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Sentence rhythm varies naturally and accelerates during the assembly sequence. A few minor scaffolding patterns appear: "For two generations... For years... For a long moment" uses similar temporal framing, and "roar of the collapse, the sudden, world-ending quiet, the loneliness of generations" stacks noun phrases mechanically. "His sole companion was the wind and the object of his obsession" leans slightly purple. The closing paragraph over-explains what the image has already shown: "he had finally, quietly, broken it" after "The beacon lived" risks redundancy. Overall clarity and momentum remain high with no loops that obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the shadow-measurement beat. However, minor scaffold appears: "His life's work, his sole motivation, was to sculpt..." restates in apposition what could stand as one claim. "The sound was wrong, like a string pulled too tight, and the preemptive nostalgia that gripped him was sharp, a sense of grieving..." stacks metaphors without tight propulsion. "Not a meteorological event but a mnemonic one" reads slightly explanatory. The final paragraph's "no longer one of absence, but of profound understanding" edges toward telling. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Clarity holds throughout; no loops obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short beats during discovery ("It was a fire spinner's kerosene rag knot"), longer accumulative sentences during the wall vision. Information density is high—most sentences advance character ritual, sensory detail, or the pattern-recognition arc. Two minor issues: "Discouragement, cold and familiar, began to seep into his bones" uses stock body metaphor, and "A playful, serious smile touched Kael's lips for the first time in months" tells emotional change rather than showing it through action. Figurative language is controlled—"riots of moon-petal vines," "blood-blossom moss"—without overwriting. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lyrical with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is high—most sentences layer image, character insight, and thematic resonance. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent: cicada as metamorphosis, tidal pools as time's texture, grotto as threshold. Deductions: slight overwriting in the opening ("heavy as unshed rain" stacks with "profound silence descended"), and "a minute, perhaps" tells elapsed time rather than showing perception shift. One near-paraphrase loop: "not a vision…but a sudden, clear understanding" restates the same content. No major line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong propulsion and information density; most lines advance atmosphere and character simultaneously. Minor loop at closure: "the ceiling felt low, the walls too close" echoes "his home shrank, a gray scar" without added pressure. Figurative language is dense ("silence so perfect and polished it felt like a weight," "solid light") but mostly coherent. The phrase "ozone and nascent starlight" threads sensory with abstract effectively. One template-stem slip: "It was his mother's, a relic...a promise" uses parallel appositive structure that could be tightened. No grammar errors; clean mechanics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies appropriately, with shorter sentences during the woman's anxiety and longer, flowing constructions during Elian's instruction. Clarity is high; no pronoun confusion or spatial drift. Minor loop: "He existed in a state of perpetual transit" in paragraph one is echoed by "her own state of being in transit" and "He was a ferryman between places" near the end—three similar constructions restate the transit motif without advancing pressure. Stock metaphor: "cathedral of peace" and "pillars and arches" lean generic. Information density is solid; no major scaffolding or filter-verb stacks, though a few tell-heavy lines ("This was his purpose, the action he was born for") slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and momentum are solid; most sentences advance story or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled and purpose-driven (light-curtain "parted with a sound like tearing silk," trees "hummed with latent power"). Minor loop: "carried no crown" echoes the abstract stakes without adding new pressure. Template cadence appears in expository beats ("This was her one chance," "Her real work began," "The sky beyond"), and a few elevated phrases ("memory-less depths," "cosmic fire") drift toward stock sci-fi diction. Information density is high in the middle third (layer-peeling montage), but the opening and closing paragraphs lean slightly toward summary. No major grammar, tense, or punctuation errors; paragraph structure varies. Sentence openings show some stem repetition ("She," "The," "Her").

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Sentence openings and lengths create visual and auditory variety. Information density is high—most lines advance ritual, emotion, or world. Minor deductions: "The suffocating weight on his chest, the familiar pressure that had become the rhythm of his days, suddenly shifted" paraphrases across two clauses without added pressure. "A deep, shuddering breath tore its way out of him, ragged and loud in the silence. It was followed by another, and then another" repeats the breathing action with synonym churn. Elevated diction ("loaded emptiness," "tender shadow keeper") occasionally risks register drift for a character in crisis, though it remains voice-consistent enough to avoid a larger penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is propulsive with high information density (the opening paragraph anchors object, setting, timeframe, backstory, and concept in five sentences), and figurative language is controlled ("a silent city of fungal spires," "humming with the energy of a thing that could become anything or nothing"). Minor scaffold appears in "Around her" and "She found the flaw" constructions, and "a guttural cry born of old rage and new hope" edges toward abstraction under peak pressure. Syntax varies effectively, and the glitchy text pattern (*<<DO NOT FEAR THE PROMISE>>*) is legible and purposeful. Sequence clarity holds, with no paraphrase loops or template runs.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    Syntax varies purposefully and the prose is largely clean, with strong imagery ("golden shadows danced like ghosts," "the breath she hadn't realized she was holding"). However, several lines carry figurative density that edges toward purple: "a weighty question in the still air," "the flotsam of history," "the immense weight of her quest lift, replaced by a novel lightness." The pairing "distilled emotion" and "indistinguishable from grief" works, but the cumulative metaphor load in high-pressure beats (the climax paragraph) slightly dilutes clarity. No loops or template cadence, but the closure beat's abstractions ("the eloquent sound of being found") lean poetic at the expense of concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied with strong imagery (liquid moonlight, nebulae fruit, chiming bells of solid sound). Sentence openings vary and paragraphs modulate length to support pacing. Minor scaffolding appears: "This was the dissolution he had sworn to prevent, the collapse of all potential into a single, dull certainty" reads slightly expository, and "a ghost of another existence" is a stock metaphor. One paraphrase loop: "factually mystical" echoed by "delicate equations" without added detail. Information density is high in the climax but the setup paragraphs carry some redundancy. No loops or artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high (dust forensics, button identification, embossed script) and most lines advance discovery or character. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at the unfurling beat and slowing for ceremonial closure. Two minor artifacts: "a profound stillness settled over Elara" is slightly abstract, and "tactfully hopeful" feels constructed rather than observed. The closing sentence ("love stubbornly tucked within its folds") borders on over-writing but remains tied to the paper's literal fold, avoiding full metaphor collapse. No loops or scaffolding; clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or stakes. No loops or template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent ("pressure change," "crack in the mirror," "ephemeral ink"). Minor figurative density in the opening ("pressure change," "ghost in their machine," "solid thing") and closing ("sacred," "golden light," "quiet promise") risks slight overwriting but remains legible. Spatial choreography is clean (apartment → streets → alleyways → marshes → causeway → booth). One passive-voice stack and a few filter verbs in the first third slightly reduce propulsion. Proofreading clean.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful with strong image density ("stone teeth," "pearlescent mist," "silent rainbows"). Minor loop: "eerie nostalgia" appears nearly identically in paragraphs two and six without reweighting; "quietly vivid" recurs as label rather than evolving texture. Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports the ritual pace. Figurative language ("parasitic melody," "negative space") is coherent and serves the concept. One paraphrase slip: paragraph five restates the prophecy's faltering in adjacent lines ("coded drips faltered, losing their pattern" / "leaving only the pure, random sound"). Apply −0.3 for loop, −0.2 for recurrence without charge.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and supports the contemplative pace; information density is high without significant loops. Minor template cadence in "A tremor ran… A shiver of awakening. The ash… began to flake… The moss… now glowed" where parallel constructions risk mechanical accumulation. The phrase "impossibly small moonstone cabochon dust speck" stacks modifiers densely, and "profound and mossy delight" in the final line borders on overwrought. No major paraphrase loops; clarity remains strong. Figurative language ("spun sugar," "long, slow sigh") is functional but frequent, skating the density threshold without breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; sentences advance character and atmosphere efficiently. Rhythm varies purposefully ("The passage opened into a vast, echoing cavern, and he stopped, mesmerized"). Minor scaffold: "uncertainly certain" and "slow, heavy rhythm of a grandfather clock" lean ornamental; the final paragraph's "profound sense of peace" and "for the first time in his life, that felt like enough" could tighten. No loops or template cadence. Figurative language (swirling leaves, phantom galaxies) is coherent and serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and information density is high throughout. However, some figurative language clusters without full integration: "scattered notes of a forgotten song," "incandescent joy," "luminous regret" stack metaphors for the same emotional territory. The phrase "a kintsugi of the soul" in paragraph four explicitly names the conceptual metaphor rather than letting the transmutation dramatize it. Minor paraphrase near the end: "crushing weight in his chest transmute" is then restated as "luminous regret, a scar that was beautiful and strong." No major loops or scaffolding, and the final image propels cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.0)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("river of mist," "tapestry of a life ended too soon"). Two distinct issues lower the score: (1) paraphrase loop in the middle third—"Her sorrow was not for her death, but for the music she could no longer create" restates what the prior sentence implies without added pressure (−0.2); (2) mild template cadence in the final third with repeated "The [noun]" stems across four sentences (−0.4). Cumulative −0.6 applied here; no other artifacts touch closure. Propulsion remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines advance character state, memory, or setting. Opening and closing images are strong. However, minor scaffold persists: "This was the ultraviolet forest" / "This was his primary method of recall" / "This was the feeling of displaced rooted" / "This was it, the focal point" creates a template cadence across the first half. The phrase "a gift from his tormentors" and "the brand of their work" in paragraph one are near-synonymous. These small loops do not touch closure but reduce propulsion mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Clarity remains strong throughout, with no spatial or temporal confusion. Minor loop: "the lens in my pocket a cool, familiar weight" in paragraph two echoes "heavy curve of glass I'd carried" and "constant companion" from paragraph one without added pressure. The "unfastening" beat leans abstract ("not of thread but of reality itself") where concrete resistance would sharpen the moment. No major scaffolding or template cadence, but figurative language clusters in high-pressure beats without always clarifying action.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery: "silence crashed down," "beam cutting a sharp cone through the gloom," "furry grey blanket" of dust, "trapped time and dry rot." Information density is high in the middle section (dust analysis, tile selection, ladder placement). Minor artifacts: "the moment arrived, the one Leo both anticipated and quietly dreaded" tells what could be shown through action; "its form grew thinner, its edges blurring into the gloom until it was nothing more than a memory" stacks three phrases describing the same fade. The opening's "liminal spaces, the in-between places where machines slept and spirits stirred" borders on poetic overreach for the established voice, though it recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful (glass orchard, curtain of shimmering dust). However, scaffold and redundancy appear: "Their purpose, however, was not preservation. Their motivation was far grander" restates the same idea, and "It was the sound of the rustling awakenings beginning in earnest, a quiet rebellion against the absolute" paraphrases the concept already established. The "immeasurable instant" paragraph stacks abstract clauses ("The birth of a star, the last word of a dying god...") in list form without concrete anchoring, and filter constructions ("The Operator did not observe it so much as become it") dull immediacy at the climax. Template cadence appears in the opening (repeated "The Operator" + action pattern across four sentences).

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (each line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes). No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled: "sliver of frozen light," "dam of art," "chorus of ghosts." Minor overwriting in the opening third: "a city carved from a dream of baroque excess" and "death rattle of a society choking on its own vanity" stack metaphors without tight integration. "Burnished sorrow" (a sound descriptor applied to an emotion) and "pearlescent light" (stock modifier) trend decorative. Storm climax is propulsive and clear. Final paragraph delivers high density without opacity. Elevated diction fits POV throughout. Small deduction for figurative density in non-peak beats; −0.3 applied within band per the Overwriting Check.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and several images are vivid ("milky-white shard," "sullen grey," "wave of resonant light"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "The chip was his tuning fork" followed by exposition on what he'd learned repeats the tuning-fork concept without added pressure; "mending what isn't torn" is stated then restated as "the world wasn't broken, but its song was out of tune." Template cadence in the exposition paragraphs (paragraph 3–4) slows momentum. Stock metaphor "slick and corroded like old metal" and the phrase "encroaching rust" recur without fresh specificity. These artifacts cluster in the setup, not the closure beat, so the penalty is moderate. Information density is high in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; no syntactic monotony. Information density is high: "the factory's closure had dried up the rust-colored creek… revealing a fissure" does three jobs in one beat. Clarity and concision hold; no paraphrase loops. Minor figurative density in the opening paragraph: "library of scents," "ephemeral," "starlight and stone," "siren call," "frontier" cluster without mud, but the register hovers at elevated lyricism before settling. The closure image is clean and propulsive. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Small scaffold: "This was the first of the hinged awakenings" and "This was the final hinged awakening" are overt structure markers that nudge toward tell; they frame rather than obscure, so impact is light.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in action beats. Opening phrase "turbine-hum reverie" and "timewoven alliances" are overwritten—abstract constructions that don't clarify or propel. The phrase "her understanding deepened through layered meanings" in paragraph three is near-paraphrase of the prior sentence's demonstration. Sentence-level propulsion is strong in the wave sequence. The final paragraph contains mild scaffold: "Her motivation had always been" explicitly restates rather than trusts prior work. Overall clarity remains high and no loops obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. The multi-layered glass revelation sequence is clearly choreographed with strong visual specificity. Two friction points lower the score: minor paraphrase loops ("The dawning hush was no longer just a time of day but a state of being" recaps earlier material) and occasional figurative density in non-peak beats ("mosaic of faded ink," "timeframe became the melting," "bruised sky") that risks ornamentation. No major artifacts touch closure, but the accumulation prevents entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no loops or scaffold detected. Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or pressure. Minor figurative density in the opening ("serene ocean of white concealing a fractured world") and middle ("sleeping beasts," "monument to defiance") reads purposeful but accumulates slightly without payoff. The final beat is clear and propulsive. Overall, clarity and momentum are strong; the piece avoids template cadence and maintains tight line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences layer world-building, character motive, and thematic weight without padding. Rhythm varies purposefully (the opening's longer, tide-like sentences contract during the creation beats). Minor template cadence appears in the repetition of "He [verb]" stems across the final third ("He exhaled," "He looked," "He felt") which flattens momentum slightly but does not obscure causality. One paraphrase loop: "not to be a vessel but a focus" is immediately restated as "an anchor for the authenticity he craved." Figurative language is dense ("salt-scoured air," "skeletons of lanterns," "forgotten constellations") but coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding mixed metaphors. No clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high; sentences advance character, world, and pressure without padding. Rhythm varies naturally (short sentences at the prophecy, longer syntactic builds in the opening). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The foghorn opening and apple-blossom close bookend effectively. Minor artifact: "the curious third-grade field trip memory" uses "curious" as a hedge, and "a chilling fluke of his specialized vocation" stacks modifiers that could tighten. These slips do not touch closure, so the cap remains above 8.0. Propulsion is clean through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "shell of silence," "snowflakes on a warm tongue," "living anchor in a sea of entropy," "thunderstorm held perfectly still in a single drop of rain." In the peak gathering beat, metaphor stacks without concrete action anchors—"loose threads of spacetime" are invited and gathered, but the physical mechanics remain abstract. Several phrases approach stock lyricism: "billion frozen fractals," "quiet chorus humming in harmony." No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the cumulative figurative load in high-pressure moments (−0.4) and elevated register that does not modulate under stress (−0.3) lower the score. Sentence openings vary and rhythm is purposeful, preventing further penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and momentum is strong through the countdown. Information density is high in the climax. Minor loop: "The hush was no longer an absence of sound, but the presence of listening" restates the shift already shown through "profound, resonant hum" and clouds parting. Template cadence appears in the countdown beat ("Forty seconds. … Thirty seconds. Twenty. … Ten.") but reads purposeful for tension. Figurative language is mostly controlled, though "song… noise designed to drown it" and "the sky's fury in his hands" tilt slightly purple without full payoff. No filter-verb stacks or major clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences layer action, image, and thematic weight without padding. The line "His true work began when the official tasks were done" propels character and stakes. Minor loop detected: "silent cathedral" and "hush" recur conceptually across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure until the final reweighting. The phrase "not just a janitor" followed later by "He was not just watching" repeats syntactic scaffolding (negation for emphasis), reducing sentence-level variety. Figurative language is controlled but dense in the climactic beat ("brushstroke," "pilgrimage," "scream," "whisper")—stays legible but approaches saturation. No filter-verb stacks or clarity harm at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Minor artifacts: "his quietude had curdled into perpetual shock" and "a reverence that felt like trespass" are vivid but edge toward elevated diction that slightly outpaces the POV's established register in peak beats. The reflective middle ("He had known it was there. It was a cornerstone…") contains one scaffolding stem ("It was…It was") that creates brief template cadence; apply −0.3. The phrase "shaping the air" (dialogue attribution) is poetic but slightly vague for the action depicted. Figurative language is dense but coherent: "silence of ghosts," "phantom spring," "sugar in water" all land without mixed metaphors. Overall momentum is strong; the closure beat is artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and imagistically strong ("thinning of the light within his own bones," "fishing in the great, silent ocean"). Information density is high; most lines serve character, world, or pressure. However, the final beat suffers from filter stacks and tell-heavy summary: "He felt the sun... the gentle weight... profound, quiet contentment" lists sensations rather than enacting them, and "The gnawing sense of his own borrowed time had vanished, replaced by the serene echo" explicitly narrates the emotional shift rather than letting the image carry it. Minor paraphrase loop: "suddenly timeless" appears as both attribute and closure state without functional variation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm and imagery are strong in many lines ("salt-laced pages," "red diamond faltered"), but figurative density is high throughout without always advancing pressure: "volumes of story," "wound in the grey canvas," "slick, iridescent comma," "notes in a chord," "braiding the first light." The closure paragraph recycles stems: "He had witnessed… had found… was complete." Paraphrase loop appears in "began to drift together, not as a puzzle to be solved, but as notes in a chord" immediately followed by "This was his method, his art: he would find a way to make them whole by harmonizing discord." These artifacts dull momentum at key beats, triggering line-level penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere. Figurative language ("glistening like a strange, metallic dew," "the world held its breath") is vivid without overwriting. Minor loop: "Days bled into weeks" is a stock phrase; "silent, synchronous exhalation" borders purple but serves the closure image. One paraphrase slip: "His motivation was simple" followed immediately by restating the motivation in different words. No major artifacts touch the closure beat. Propulsion is steady; the wrapping sequence compresses time efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines advance perception, setting, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the final paragraph's short declaratives ("It was his data point, his contribution to the whole. He did not feel converted, only expanded.") create effective closure cadence. Minor template-cadence slip: "The official literature spoke of...Aris cataloged it as..." and similar parallel constructions recur without pattern-teaching, creating a slight drumbeat in the first half. The "bronze quiet" phrase appears three times with slight rewording; the third instance earns its reprise by reweighting the motif, but the middle mention feels decorative. No loops that obscure causality, and figurative language remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and imagistic with strong propulsion. Opening line ("where the world ended and stubbornly began anew") anchors voice and stakes. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no runs of identical stems. Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph 2 ("He carried…drove…was…had come…knelt…opened") slows momentum slightly but remains voice-coherent. Metaphors are controlled ("stone finger," "library of potential futures," "ocean's frantic librarians") without muddle. The final image ("narrow line of hope against the vast and silent dark") recharges the opening "narrow vastness." Clarity high; no loops or paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high, with most lines doing double work (e.g., "his breathing a slow and steady rhythm against the silence" anchors character and tone). Minor overwriting in the opening ("fine, red dust," "grim work," "desolate present") clusters figurative language without clear pattern-teaching, triggering a small deduction. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. The closure beat is clean and propulsive. One slight register drift in "intuitively descriptive question mark" (meta-phrasing) but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening third. The vision sequence introduces paraphrase loops: "She saw...She saw..." in adjacent lines without added pressure. A minor register drift appears in "relativistic chaos" and "temporal distortion"—terms slightly elevated beyond the established voice. The final paragraph stacks declarative summary ("Her confusion hadn't been a flaw; it was a higher state of awareness") that dulls propulsion at closure. No loops touch the closure image itself, limiting penalty severity.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propels: short urgency ("This was the moment.") alternates with lyric description. Information density is high; most lines advance character, action, or atmosphere. Minor scaffold: "His motivation was not greed, but a desire taught by his master" front-loads exposition that could emerge through action; "His method was one of finesse" tells before showing. Paraphrase loop: "cautious abandon" and "reverence and audacity" restate the same oxymoron within two paragraphs. Figurative language is vivid ("tooth of glacial ice," "falling snowflake silence") without muddling.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively; rhythm varies with sentence length and syntax. Information density is high: "her new, self-appointed role was to be the historian of small gestures" compresses backstory and present motive efficiently. However, the phrase "luminous absence" appears twice in close proximity (penultimate and final paragraphs) as thematic decoration rather than fresh pressure. Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph four ("she knew then," "she was not") slightly dulls immediacy. Final image—lock turning "with a groan that echoed"—propels closure cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Density is high (stone search, feather memory, tactile method, planting act compressed efficiently), and the opening line anchors voice ("made a home of getting lost"). Sentence rhythm varies well across moves. Two small loop artifacts: "nightly" appears in close proximity (paragraph one and two) without reweighting, and "not as... but as" template recurs ("not a place... but a foundation," "not of words, but of connection"). These do not obscure causality but create mild template cadence. No filter-verb stacks or metaphor muddle; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the decoding sequence. Information density is high; most lines advance character insight or escalation. Minor deductions: "a ghost that followed him even here" is a stock metaphor; "the woven hush unraveled with a sound like a million held breaths being released" leans slightly overwritten for the closure beat. Paraphrase check: "He had to succeed by decoding the frayed threads" and the preceding clause "His breakthrough came...from the messy, chaotic tangle of its frayed border" restate similar content, triggering a −0.2 penalty. No loops or scaffold elsewhere; grammar and sequencing are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("needle aimed at the heart of the sky") is controlled. Information density is high; lines often layer setting, character stance, and thematic weight. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "forged hush" recurs without added pressure in early paragraphs, and "the canyon… became her instrument" + "her method was simple yet profound" feel like adjacent explanations of the same idea. Minor register drift into elevated abstraction ("the final foreclosure on their collective soul") slightly dulls immediacy in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively; opening long tumble contrasts with tight crisis beats. Information density is high: each scar encodes both technique and history. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting in paragraph one: "a pocket of stillness between the held inhalation and the final, ragged release" stacks metaphor on metaphor when "single breath" already carries the frame. "A defiant pulse that pushed back the crushing green darkness" lands clearly at closure with no figurative muddle, securing the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. Clarity and propulsion are strong through most beats. Overwriting cluster in opening: "intimately aloof," "a study in being," "a lifetime," "sharp-edged truths," "weary of speaking" stack figurative language without pattern-teaching, triggering −0.4 for density. Mixed metaphor: "the weight in his soul felt...like his own again" conflates emotional and physical registers awkwardly. Template cadence in final paragraph: "He had fulfilled...," "He watched...," "...its story complete" recycles stems. Total deduction ~−0.6 in Q7. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; grammar is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies well, and information density is high. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor overwriting: "a fragrance that was less a smell and more a memory of safety" stacks modifiers, and "the frantic, hopeful beating of his own heart" is slightly stock. One paraphrase loop: "It was anger, not guidance" follows immediately after the foghorn description without added pressure. No major artifacts, but density could tighten in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is controlled: "hydraulics fail," "shivering compass needle," "grinding stars." Information density is high in the opening and rooftop beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The frequency of solace is the weight of the bronze" is restated twice in close proximity without added pressure. Template cadence in the setup paragraph ("He was here to build… His tools were not… His method was…") creates a parallel stem run. The closure beat is clear and propulsive, but the mid-section summary ("For weeks, these calls had guided him") compresses key causal work into telling. No major artifacts touch the final image, capping deduction at −0.8 cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; high-pressure beats compress ("He closed his hand... He focused all his will...") while calmer moments expand detail. Information density is strong: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or causality without padding. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deductions: "the wind stealing the words from his lips" is a stock metaphor; "soul-deep need for solitude" uses an elevated modifier where embodied perception would sharpen immediacy; "a nightmare of truthful bartering" tells rather than showing one concrete beat of that transaction. These artifacts appear in setup rather than closure, keeping closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean and rhythmically varied: "The man had carried no coat against the chill, no bag for a journey, and his shoes had left prints too faint for the damp wood." Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or understanding. Minor scaffold appears in paragraph four: "He saw shards of a life" followed by list-like sensory fragments slightly dulls momentum before "The gaps told the real story" recovers. No loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The final image propels without overwriting: "feeling the weight of one less ghost in the world, and his own isolation, for a moment, witnessed and shared."

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph structure breathes. Information density is high without padding (sugar crystals → ants → map → chip sequence is economical). Specificity is strong: "type foundry matrix chip," "pale ghostly fungi," "translucent as moth wings." Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Grammar and tense are clean. Minor issues: "a liquid clock ticking away his chance" and "the weight of his promise feeling heavier" are near-clichés that slightly reduce freshness. The phrase "a vast and featureless plain he'd wandered since Elara's death" (loneliness metaphor) is functional but predictable. Filter-verb stack in one passage ("feeling," "seeing") slightly dulls immediacy without touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies and propulsion is strong; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense ("wound in the mountain," "bleeding starlight," "lacy menace") but coherent and purposeful. Minor deductions: "the first fireflies of summer" feels slightly labored in proximity to "hesitant constellation," and "the dissolution of self, the blissful erosion" borders on synonym stacking. Otherwise, clarity and momentum hold.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Opening metaphor string ("distill not gold, but feeling, to bottle the very weight of a moment") risks overwriting in a single beat. Paraphrase check: "The math is perfect, the form is divine, yet the result is… sterile. The presence isn't there" repeats the same content across two sentences without added pressure (−0.2). "Directed spontaneity" and "palette of resolve" appear as scaffold phrases without full dramatization. No loops or major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the flight sequence ("rushing past my face," "tore at my clothes") and slowing for reflection. Information density is high; most lines advance character state or thematic pressure. Minor loop detected: "jealousy" and "envied"/"resented" cycle across adjacent paragraphs without adding new pressure until the flight memory shifts the pattern. A few stock phrases ("thick with dust motes," "hazy but hopeful future") reduce specificity slightly. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, which remains propulsive and imagistically clear.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives during the reading ("This cycle repeats") contrast with longer, textured sentences in framing passages. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the motif of emptiness. One minor overwriting slip: "a sound of breaking and mending all at once" stacks metaphor without adding precision. The piece avoids filter-verb stacks and maintains clarity under pressure. Concrete nouns and strong verbs predominate ("scuttling her life," "mapping the rhythm").

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally, sentence openings differ, and information density is high: most lines advance character state, affliction mechanics, or emotional progression. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Clarity and momentum are strong; the sequence from held breath to memory to touch to shedding is propulsive. Minor density slip: "a crow quill with a meticulously trimmed tip, its blackness a stark contrast to the pale stone" front-loads description that could interleave with action. Zero filter-verb stacks or stock metaphors in peak beats; figurative language ("frost on a winter windowpane," "ocean of silent, blue air") is coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short bursts during the ritual ("She flipped a switch. A low hum filled the archive") contrast with longer embedded clauses in setup. "The ghosts of regrets are the most stubborn" and "striking a bell in a vacuum" are vivid without muddle. Minor loop: "the scent of lilac faded back into the bottle" nearly echoes "scent hit him… lilac, Elara's favorite, pouring from the sealed bottle"—functional but close. No significant artifacts; information density is high. One weak line: "The hush was over" tells what the prior sentence showed (diesel engine).

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean, but rhythm is uniform: most sentences follow subject-verb-object with embedded clauses, creating a steady, slow cadence that does not vary with pressure. Several paraphrase loops appear: "resounding hush" recurs five times without reweighting; "unravel" and "unify" are repeated in adjacent lines without added pressure. Figurative language is dense ("tapestry," "seam," "threads," "syllable") but some metaphors drift ("hiccup" versus "stutter" for the same event). Filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") appear frequently, dulling immediacy. Information density is moderate; many sentences restate theme rather than advancing action.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with strong propulsion: "The station itself was an eminently peculiar place" launches efficient worldbuilding, and the counting sequence accelerates into the discovery beat without loops. Information density is high; sentences layer character, setting, and theme. Minor deduction: "a tectonic flaw in the fabric of his world" and "the width of a spider's thread" are near-stock metaphors that slightly elevate register in a high-pressure beat. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected; clarity and momentum are maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high across most beats. The opening anchors voice and stakes efficiently; the final image recycles the lantern with reweighted meaning. Minor loop detected: "lucid contradiction" appears verbatim twice (once in the setup paragraph, once in the climax), and "clover melancholy" bookends without evolving function. Template cadence in the traversal section ("Each scrawl was… It was a world of…") creates a brief rhythmic sag. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops touch the closure beat, so penalties remain mid-range. Grammar and tense are consistent; no major opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Information density is high (the velvet pouch, the glass disc's etch, the method's mechanics all advance character and atmosphere). One paraphrase moment: "He did not offer comfort. He offered a pattern" / "This was the core of the method" slightly restates without added pressure. The metaphor "a musical question mark placed at the end of every emotional period" is apt but borders on over-writing in a high-pressure beat. No loops or scaffold otherwise; clarity and concision are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop conceptually: "proximate causes" appears twice in abstract contexts, "covenant" recurs four times (chemical, regenerated, fragile, reborn), and "haunted" serves double duty in the final paragraph. The metaphor "chemical covenant" is strained—covenants are social, not molecular. Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching, and "shivering energy" plus "haunted euphoria" in quick succession risk overwriting the emotional turn. No major clarity breaks, but the prose would benefit from pruning near-synonyms and metaphor sprawl in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense. Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final image ("one shared story at a time") recharges the earlier motif without redundancy. Word choice is specific (pockmarked, splintered, grizzled) and syntax supports scene needs—longer sentences for reflection, shorter for turns. Minor issue: "desperately jocular" in paragraph two borders on label-speak, though it's immediately dramatized. Strategic telling compresses backstory (past favors, work history) efficiently. Grammar and continuity are clean; no filter-verb stacks or register drift. Zero opacity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally with strong propulsion and high information density; most sentences advance character state or world detail. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge the "quiet blaze" motif cleanly. Minor issue: a few figurative phrases in the opening third approach density without full payoff ("eerie quiet," "deafening orchestra," "crushing soundscape" cluster within ~100 words), and "language of growth and rain" / "language of deep roots" / "languages of stone and spore" creates a template-cadence echo. The accumulation doesn't obscure causality or dull closure, so penalties remain modest, but the figurative clustering in the setup prevents entry to the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively; the opening's weighted silence contrasts with frantic mid-section fragments and the measured closing cadence. Information density is high: nearly every line advances character, stakes, or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor deduction: "His motivation now was simple, stark, and all-consuming: to thresh meaning" tilts slightly elevated/abstract for peak interiority, and "the person he was when it happened" could be tighter. Figurative language (warping, threshing, harvest) remains coherent and voice-motivated throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, the piece carries noticeable decorative layering: "a place of profound quiet built during the timeframe when no one remembers you" (mixed metaphor—time doesn't build places); "spectral symphony," "divining rod for oblivion," "testament of joyful sorrow" stack figurative language without always clarifying. "His only companion was the memory of Lyra, a whispering advisor who now lived only in the spaces between his thoughts" uses synonym churn (companion/advisor, memory/lived in spaces). The final paragraph loops slightly: "same, yet entirely changed" and "never be truly silent again" restate the closure effect. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull propulsion in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies (short crisis beats, longer reflective close) and information density is high—most sentences advance discovery or reweight motive. Two minor artifacts surface: "volcanic" recurs three times (opening metaphor, "volcanic heat," implicit in "quiet...fire"), risking over-pattern, and the final paragraph stacks several metaphoric closures in quick succession ("a curator of a true one," "give a ghost her voice back," "quiet, enduring fire") that border on summary eloquence rather than lean image. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; no paraphrase loops or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propels; paragraph structure supports visual rhythm. Information density is high (e.g., "sensors... translating her percussive grief into data, and then into light" economically advances cause and effect). However, two clusters of filter verbs in peak beats ("she could feel his pride," "It was so vivid, so real") dull immediacy. The phrase "a novel form of synesthesia" in the opening reads as diagnostic rather than embodied. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. The final image ("a lonely musician in her sound wave garden, playing a duet for one") lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean with strong concrete detail and purposeful rhythm variation. Sentence structure modulates well between Silas's calm precision and the container maze's oppressive scale. No template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Minor overwriting: "whispers travel farther than shouts" is stated rather than left implicit, and "the bruised light of the storm dancing in his eyes" leans decorative in the final beat. Information density is high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports the measured, ceremonial pace. Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances the ritual or deepens the relationship with the darkness. Minor overwriting appears: "spiralingly calm" recurs without added meaning, and "a presence of profound sorrow that had not yet learned its own shape" leans abstract. The metaphor "a firefly sighing its last" mixes registers (fireflies don't sigh) but reads poetic rather than muddled. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; propulsion is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, attribute, or the window-display plan. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates between reflective passages and the ninth-bell climax. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. A few phrases approach stock metaphor ("bottom of a frozen sea," "fertile soil of doubts") but remain legible and purposeful. The figurative load is heavy in the opening third but thins during action, avoiding overwriting penalties. Clarity and propulsion are strong; the final paragraph compresses aftermath efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph structure creates visual breathing. Information density is high: most lines serve character, world, or pressure. Minor template cadence in the opening ("moved… flowed… watched… said") across four consecutive beats. No paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("fortress of practicality," "watery threshold"). "Soul-shaking thrum" and "impossible quality" edge toward abstraction in peak beats. Overall momentum is strong; the ritual sequence propels cleanly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: each line advances either the ritual, the internal state, or the thematic charge. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives during whittling, longer cadences for narration). One minor loop: "hot and cleansing" and "awakening the sleeping spirit" slightly over-embellish the tea moment with adjacent figurative language, though the pattern is taught as Elias's performance mode. The final paragraph is clean and propulsive. No scaffold or template cadence; prose is controlled and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language ("cloud-shadow poet," "sheet of polished bone," "geological time and starlight") creates texture without obscuring sense. Information density is high in the opening and middle, and sentence structures vary purposefully. However, several template stems appear in the climactic passage ("He did not want," "He closed his eyes," "He began to let go," "He felt the ancient memory"), creating minor cadence monotony at a peak beat. The final paragraph contains paraphrase loops: "no longer an object of mystery but a kindred spirit" / "no longer intimidating but inviting" / "no longer an absence but a presence"—three parallel not-X-but-Y constructions that restate the same conceptual shift without added pressure. Apply −0.6 for template stems and paraphrase loops in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong sensory anchors (firelight, searing heart, piercingly clear note). Sentence variety supports rhythm. Two minor loops: "It was not a sickness…it was a fading" and the paraphrase around Vex's despair. A metaphor cluster in the opening ("phoenix rises," "ash and smoke," "glassblower's courtyard") loads texture early but doesn't obscure cause/effect. The phrase "impossibly thin and perfectly clear" stacks modifiers at a key moment without adding specificity. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with strong verbs ("coax," "transmuted," "blossomed"), but several lines suffer from abstraction: "artificial pilgrimage" repeats without adding pressure, "golden shadows" becomes a refrain rather than evolving image, and "texture of connection" is asserted three times. The phrase "propel this wave, to give it purpose beyond simple vibration" stacks near-synonyms. Template cadence appears in the apparatus sequence: "He mounted... He wasn't trying... He felt..." Information density is high in the climax but thins during the opening reflection. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts, but figurative language ("cascades of faint, colored light") clusters without clear payoff until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.9)
    Opening and closing images are strong: "reflection showed a man he barely recognized" → "fire in his forge...enough to teach the darkness how to bloom." Figurative density is high throughout without creating muddle, but some constructions feel templated: "A quiet purpose, a subdued ardor, began to stir" relies on abstract nouns where concrete action would sharpen. "Grief had been a smith, hammering his soul" is vivid but the next clause ("into a shape that no longer fit") dilutes it. The "curtains of intention" exposition paragraph (four) stops momentum to explain mechanics. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. No loops or major artifacts, but information density could tighten—several beats tell what's already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically varied. Opening line—"The rain fell in sheets against the skylight, each drop a momentary lens magnifying the bruised twilight of the city"—anchors voice and atmosphere. Information density is high: most sentences advance character, setting, or theme. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Sentence variety supports the contemplative pacing. Minor overwriting appears in the final paragraph: "the next great and terrible thing we would build together, just to watch it fall" stacks modifiers and leans slightly purple, though it serves the thematic image. Figurative language is controlled: "digital fever that had broken," "ghost of the digital gold rush," "anatomy of his own ruin." One weak phrase: "a profound weight settled in the room" is abstract and generic, breaking the specificity elsewhere. Syntax and grammar are clean; no pronoun ambiguity or tense drift. Strategic telling compresses transit efficiently ("After a long silence"). Overall momentum is steady, though the middle demonstration section risks slight drag with card-by-card explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, several passages exhibit overwriting: "atoms of nostalgia" appears three times with slight variations; "shimmering" recurs in the final paragraph ("shimmering, fractured histories," "shimmering composite"); and figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching (bronze prism, tapestry of connections, ripple in the pond, crystalline beauty). The phrase "exquisite, unbearable clarity of a joy that had cost her everything" stacks abstractions at the closure beat, dulling precision. Minor scaffold: "Her entire life had been an unconscious preparation" tells what the next sentence should show.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied. Sentences advance character and atmosphere with high information density ("a sliver of forgotten trauma from a shared nightmare that had broken free from her core"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges motifs. Minor penalty for two moments of elevated abstraction: "a testament to a love strong enough to hold a soul together" and "the shape of hope was secure" feel slightly declarative rather than embodied. Figurative language is mostly controlled, though "a poisonous vine strangling a perfect rose" is a stock metaphor. No scaffold artifacts or pronoun confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is vivid and controlled with high information density. "Coiled around," "velvet cloth under the magnifier's bright eye," "dull, frightened brown" all do double work. Minor artifacts: "shimmering stillness" (paragraph 1) and "shimmering with a quiet, enduring hope" (final paragraph) loop the same root image without evolution; "quietly vivid" appears twice (chameleons in paragraph 2, turquoise/jade in paragraph 7). Paraphrase check: "His own convictions felt just as shattered" / "to balance the two, or he would lose himself completely" slightly restates the knot without advancing it. Apply −0.3 for minor loop and template echo. No closure-beat harm.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is largely clean with strong information density and varied rhythm. Opening and closing lines anchor well. "Meteor hush" and "frosted hourglass" are specific, non-generic images. Minor overwriting in the middle: "the story of a door being ripped from its hinges, leaving a space that could never be properly filled" edges toward explanation after the more potent "violent tearing, a fragmentation of self." The ivy's "slow, green pulse" and "patient survival" work, but "brutally pruned back last autumn" lands with slightly more telling than the rest of the passage. No loops or template cadence. Figurative language is purposeful and mostly coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sensory density is high without opacity. Minor redundancies: "silent farewell" and "one-way adoration" cover similar ground within two beats. "Phantom elbows" and "reconstructed past" show strong specificity. The metaphor "forgotten lyrics searching desperately for their tune" recurs effectively as structural motif. Figurative language is dense—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor—but remains legible and tonally consistent with the lyric mode. A few filter verbs cluster in the vision sequence without slowing the beat. No template cadence or synonym loops; information density is solid. Slight overwriting keeps this out of the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, interiority, or the ritual. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; the prose is concise and purposeful. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "sky bled," "ghostly fire," "diamond stylus," "charcoal…a sliver of the night sky." Minor overwriting: "crushing static, a sound that had long ago smothered her own music" pairs three metaphors in close succession, and "the tiny, scattered pieces of nebulae and supernovae that had coalesced into fearful, temporary beings" stacks modifiers. The opening exposition is efficient but slightly summary-heavy before scene action begins. Grammar and mechanics are clean; no significant artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level is strong: "a net cast across the glowing sand" and "filament of captured light" are concrete and propulsive. Rhythm modulates well—short declaratives at the crisis ("The violent shuddering ceased"), longer syntactic weave during reflection. One artifact cluster lowers score: "ghost-pale flora" / "ghost-memory" / "quantum ghost" repeats "ghost" as a crutch modifier across three early paragraphs without functional variation, and "the feeling of being everywhere receding back into the solid, singular form" mildly paraphrases the established "occasionally everywhere" concept. Neither touches closure, so deduction is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies appropriately, and figurative language—"dew," "filigree," "cathedral-like"—is vivid and mostly coherent. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty (e.g., "Its canopy was a filigree of brass and steel, its rivers flowed with lubricating oils" grounds world and tone simultaneously). However, the story contains paraphrase loops and template cadence in the climactic sequence: "He called it the hum of insight" follows a sentence defining the same phenomenon; "The hum grew stronger" echoes "low, resonant frequency started to build." The phrase "the hum of insight" appears three times in close succession without pattern-teaching or functional variation. Filter verbs ("he thought," "he called it") cluster in high-pressure moments, dulling immediacy. No artifacts touch the final image directly, so penalties remain moderate. Clarity is high, but momentum sags in the revelation passage due to summary and repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density ("purple ink bleeding," "sea-worn stones," "country of ghosts") enriches without overwhelming. Clarity is strong except for one slight loop: "The journey was a strange and winding thing, a pilgrimage through indirect routes" followed by "They did not follow the ridge's crest but instead tracked…" restates indirection. The phrase "each step was an act of trust, a quiet defiance" borders on mild abstraction but stays grounded enough. Information density is high; no significant scaffold. Minor deduction for the slight paraphrase loop and one filter-verb cluster ("she had heard," "she knew") that could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse, and paragraphs create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. One minor scaffold issue: "the phantom tingle of his regenerating nerves felt like a constant, low-voltage accusation" leans slightly ornamental, but it anchors a motif. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity and propulsion are maintained. The figurative language (frostbite as clarity, bolt as question mark) is controlled and coherent, enriching rather than obscuring the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmically controlled with vivid imagery ("violet light," "tremor, soft as falling silk"). However, figurative language clusters heavily: "phantom river," "pinpoint of immense gravity," "divine right, a phantom limb," "timeless dust" in quick succession without pattern-teaching. "Regally unpretentious" and "profoundly weary" are label-only descriptors. Paraphrase loop: "The act was not violent; it was an absolute and final command to sunder" restates the prior sentence's content. Template cadence in the convergence paragraph: "He passed...He followed...There, resting..."

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies cleanly; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high—nearly every line advances setting, motive, or the tapping-practice mystery. Figurative language ("a concrete anchor in the vast, indifferent blue," "shards of stained glass") is vivid without overwriting. Minor density lapse: "His motivation was a quiet, desperate need" tells what prior beats have shown. The final image—viewport blooming then fading—propels without scaffold. Zero loops; coherent propulsion throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot without padding. The figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated: "frozen lightning," "thunderous serenity," "constellation of ghosts awakened by the thrum." Minor template cadence appears in the middle section with repeated "She [verb]" stems across three sentences ("She stopped... She didn't raise... She adjusted..."), triggering a −0.4 deduction. No paraphrase loops or major clarity issues. The final image is sharp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies naturally, information density is high ("script was not ink, but an embroidered pattern of what looked like stylized leaves and roots, a cryptic message"), and metaphors are coherent ("sulfurous steam coiling around her weathered hands like ghosts of the old world"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs impede momentum. Minor overwriting appears in the final paragraph—"a single point of light in the churning water" followed immediately by "A new tradition had begun, not by accident, but by design" restates the triumph rather than advancing it—but does not touch the closure image itself, so the penalty remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm accelerates cleanly through the panic beat; sentence length varies with pressure. Information density is high: "the crumpled photograph stored there" conveys years of handling without separate exposition. Minor deduction for one paraphrase loop: "She fought the paralysis not by fighting the memory, but by sinking into the present" followed immediately by "She forced her awareness into the grit of soil" restates the same tactic. Otherwise no scaffold, no template cadence, and figurative language (ice spreading, pearl of stillness) remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high in the central work sequence; sentences advance through concrete action (gathering, arranging, crushing charcoal). Some overwriting in figurative clusters: "luminescent ache," "geography of his own inner world," "cartographer of the fractured soul" stack metaphors in quick succession without mechanical grounding. Paraphrase loop appears: "suffocating pressure…recede" / "walls…had seemed to press in…now simply stood" restates relief across two beats. Minor template stems ("He would…He would…He pulled…He arranged") in the redesign paragraph. No clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual variety. Information density is high, most lines advancing character, world, or plot. Minor template cadence appears in the eclipse/rockslide setup ("a moment of pure crisis…in that moment") and in the ink description block (three sentences beginning with "It/They"), but these do not touch closure. The final paragraph's "One moment…The next" construction is conventional but clean. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled ("viscous midnight," "fractal lattices"), though "syrupy stretching of time" and "cavernous echo" edge toward stock metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies appropriately, and the prose carries strong images ("echoing library under snow," "ether"). However, multiple lines loop conceptually: "dizzying quiet" appears three times with minor variation, and "profound betrayal" is stated then paraphrased. Template cadence in the middle section ("She bypassed... descended... sat...") and some stock metaphor phrasing ("within the blink that follows surprise") reduce density. The closure image is vivid and propulsive, but earlier beats could tighten to eliminate redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template runs. Information density is high: "airship ballast sandbag scrap" anchors backstory and setting in one image. Figurative language is controlled ("sun bled," "tranquil blaze") and coherent. Minor deductions: "profound, engraved quiet" and "profound negation" recycle "profound" without earned variation (−0.2); "legacy of violence waiting to be claimed" + "legacy she would not entertain" loops the concept across adjacent paragraphs (−0.2). No filter-verb stacks or scaffold in peak beats; the closure sentence is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose features heavy figurative density throughout, particularly in the opening and climax: "feral lullaby," "somnambulist's waltz," "phantom limb in the symphony of the spheres," "the shape of a held breath, the color of a last goodbye." Many of these metaphors stack without pausing for concrete action, creating drag during high-pressure beats—the climax paragraph layers "antenna for sorrow," "deluge of abandonment," "impossibly pure tone that was the inverse of sound," and "starlight and absence" in rapid succession without grounding sensory anchors. The phrase "frantic zigzag" appears once as a summary rather than being dramatized through discrete turns. Several lines engage in conceptual restatement: "a pang of loss so profound it had no sound" closely echoes "voiceless grief," and the final two sentences paraphrase the same resolution ("work was done" / "turned his back").

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Syntax varies purposefully, rhythm breathes with scene pressure, and information density is high—most lines advance character or conflict. The opening ("phone clicked dead, silence amplifying the hum") and closing images are vivid and charged. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent beats: "For years, Celeste had watched" / "she, ever the devotedly observant daughter, saw" restates the same content without added pressure. The "orbits of regret" / "gravitational pull" / "satellites of sorrow" cluster in the opening paragraph reads as metaphor-stacking rather than pattern-taught compression. No significant loops or template cadence beyond these touches; clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. The opening ("Elian traced the stars of Lyra onto a client's shoulder, his needle a whisper against skin") anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor template cadence appears in the middle section: "He had to hush it. He had to give the sound a place to rest. He had to tether this echo..." reads as deliberate parallelism but borders on scaffold. Two paraphrase loops: "a map away from a memory" / "outrun" and "the dissonance of old guilt" / "source of his hum" restate without added pressure. No filter-verb stacks or grave artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with strong imagery ("mist coiled around the damp archways," "gritty texture of sand on her knees grounding her"). However, ornamental phrasing accumulates: "a soundless scream held in the collective throat," "islands of solitude, adrift in the same silent sea," "a study in transient beauty" stack metaphors without always advancing pressure. The scaffold phrase "This was" appears twice in opening paragraphs. Minor synonym churn ("hollowed-out expressions" / "lilac unease" / "entropic quiet") and some filter-verb reliance ("she thought she heard," "she saw") dull immediacy in a few beats.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or action. Figurative language ("arms of steel," "nexus of agony," "editor, excising the corrupted text") is controlled but clusters densely in the opening and middle, risking slight overwriting. One paraphrase loop: "The patterns were not damage; they were a circuit board, a forgotten interface" restates the same idea without added pressure. The mosaic metaphor (tessera, stepping stone, chipped patterns as circuit) is coherent and purposeful. Grammar and tense are clean, and the final line ("his terrible and gentle gift") recapitulates the opening motif without staleness.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies well; information density is high (most lines advance Julian's tactics or Elara's state). Clarity is generally strong with concrete images anchoring abstractions. Two friction points lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop in opening—"low hum of rising nostalgia" and "fractured time, a concept he didn't understand but perceived" restate Julian's liminal state without added pressure (−0.2). (2) Template cadence in the echo sequence: "He reached… He let… He smiled… He needed… He plucked… He summoned…" runs six consecutive "He [verb]" stems across the middle third (−0.5). No figurative muddle or proximity to famous lines; the prose is clean and propulsive overall, but the stem repetition dulls momentum in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm and information density are strong. A few minor scaffolds appear: "He wanted to say, *Ready for what, another disappointment?* but he bit back the doubt" is a standard "wanted to / but" construction; "his voice full of a hope so fragile it felt like spun glass" stacks metaphor without adding pressure. The phrase "willowglass hope" in the final paragraph is a neologism without prior anchoring, risking opacity. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language density is controlled except in two beats where metaphor leans decorative ("hairline crack in a solid wall" is serviceable but stock). Overall propulsion is clean with vivid, selective detail.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Clarity is strong with one exception: "the world was in the deep quiet now, the time after humans hibernate" introduces the hibernation premise but never integrates it into her choices or the cave encounter, functioning as atmosphere only. The floating sequence is clearly rendered with physical specifics (resonant frequency, local gravitational constant). No loops or scaffold. Minor register drift: "factually mystical" in paragraph two reads slightly elevated for the otherwise grounded voice, though it serves the world's premise.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, vivid imagery ("sandstone cliffs," "canyon echo in a jar," "rows of identical, functional pewter buttons"), purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—each button advances both plot and theme. One minor paraphrase loop: "The cataloging was a form of listening, a way to give each ghost its turn to speak clearly" restates the prior sentence's work without adding pressure. A second loop appears late: "The prophecy was not a monolith; it was a tapestry woven from these tiny, individual threads" then "But a crossroads, detailing the exact moment of choice"—both explain rather than trust the prior dramatization. Stock metaphor intrudes once: "Days bled into weeks." Overall propulsion is steady; no major clarity breaks, but the loops dull momentum slightly in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., pillbox description conveys backstory, object, and emotional state). Opening and closing images are strong. However, several paraphrase loops and near-duplicates appear: "world was reduced" / "life, too, was reduced"; "faithless world" / "prudently daring and recklessly desperate" (synonym churn). Template cadence in the Kestrel introduction paragraph ("a man who," "a prime example of") and a therapy-adjacent phrase ("unused courage waits") lower line-level tightness. No filter-verb stacks or major artifacts touching closure, so deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is controlled with high information density and purposeful rhythm variation; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor texture overload in the palimpsest passage: "rising like bubbles in slow-boiling tar" followed immediately by three "came" constructions risks slight template cadence, though the content differentiates each layer. Figurative language ("soupy white," "metallic heartbeat," "viscous breath") is mostly apt but occasionally clusters without pattern-teaching. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully. The final paragraph achieves strong propulsion with清 clean causal sequencing (drops stop → silence falls → knot loosens → bell rings → hands steady).

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully with few template stems. Minor overwriting in "the sun bled out" and "surrender its climb" could tighten, but figurative language doesn't dominate high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop near the end: "profound silence... quiet not of emptiness, but of peace" restates without added pressure (−0.2). The "thrum" motif returns effectively across beats without becoming mechanical. Propulsion is strong through the channel-building climax with clear sequence and no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; information density is high in peak beats. Minor template cadence in the reflection paragraph ("Her father had been... and she, his daughter, had become") and slight overwriting in "quivering hush of the late hour." The closure image is clean. One paraphrase loop: "offering a piece of her world" echoes "reflect light into dark corners" without added pressure. Figurative language ("tiny star," "metallic bloom") remains coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (e.g., "a place woven from mist and starlight above a sea of forgotten clouds" does triple work). The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor figurative density in the first paragraph ("contemporary of ghosts," "wing that had not cut the air") risks ornament, though it remains legible. A few phrases edge toward elevated diction ("atomically reflective expanse") but stay within the POV's lexicon. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence detected. Read-aloud rhythm is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled in most beats. Minor overwriting appears: "a profound sense of peace settled over her, a quietness that wasn't empty but full, prismatic" stacks abstractions without fresh image. The phrase "she suddenly understood" is scaffold that tells the turn rather than showing it through action or perception. Paraphrase loops are minimal. Template cadence and filter verbs are well-managed. Information density is generally high, though some lines ("It was a constellation of human hearts") feel decorative rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally and information density is high (most lines advance character, world, or pressure). Clarity is strong with vivid specifics: "bakelite cool and solid," "VU meters barely trembled," "ozone and dust." Minor loop: "the air crackled with a particularly virulent transmission" and "a new signal would pulse" echo structurally without added pressure. Figurative language ("cosmic ocean of paper," "dying stars") fits voice but borders on density in the opening. No major artifacts touch closure; the final image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level propulsion is strong in action beats, but the prose carries several artifact patterns: "cold and sharp" (panic), "mournful sound groaned to life," "desperate clarity," and "profound sense of awe" are stock descriptors that flatten peak moments. The phrase "lonely church organ" appears twice in identical form across separate paragraphs, a minor loop. Sentence openings vary adequately, but figurative density ("skeletal ruin…clawing at a canopy," "thick velvet of dust," "violent frenzy") stacks without always advancing pressure. The climax sentence "It was this hum that lanced out" uses a filter construction that dulls immediacy at the story's hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with strong concrete details, but exhibits noticeable pattern artifacts. The piece deploys template parallelism extensively: "the violence, the unmaking / the confusion, the spirit, the dissolving"; "Joy and despair. A party and a grave"; "not a memory or a vision, but..."; "not the thunderclap...but a quiet, fragile ache." This creates rhythmic monotony in peak beats where variation would sharpen impact. Filter verbs stack in places ("He felt a pang," "he sought the victim") without voice justification. Several metaphors work hard ("the world had been violently scooped out, leaving a wound") but land cleanly. Information density is adequate but the opposites-pairing structure becomes visible scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high (journals, coded stanzas, coordinates, drone, reversal rite all advance plot). However, several template-cadence runs and paraphrase loops reduce line-level tightness: "He felt a familiar surge… the feeling of standing on a cliff edge" restates the same emotion; "He felt the dread thicken, no longer just atmospheric but personal" over-explains. Stock phrases ("heart hammering against his ribs," "breathing entity") and filter-verb stacks ("he believed," "he felt," "he saw") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy. Final image is strong, but figurative language earlier (sky-river, salt-tongue) occasionally strains clarity without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; the prose advances character and atmosphere in most lines. Two clusters of elevated figurative language appear in quick succession: "thrumming with absence," "great bell had been struck," "ozone tang of a miracle," "spin the memory into something solid before it dissolved like her" (paragraphs 1–2). The density is purposeful but borders overwriting in the opening third. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Spatial choreography is clear. The final line's "question mark of impossible hope" charges the closure cleanly. Apply −0.3 for figurative clustering without pattern-teaching in high-pressure opening beats.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and informationally dense: "the faces of forgotten leaders and exotic animals staring up into the gloom" does double duty as image and thematic seed. A few overwritten moments: "a study in a polished calm," "the quiet, dusky harmony of what remains" stack modifiers in high-pressure beats without clear payoff. No loops or scaffold. The final paragraph compresses the thematic comparison efficiently, though "ravenous hunger" as a shared label feels slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or the central question. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing images anchor voice and stakes. Three friction points: "His singular motivation" (paragraph one) and "His action in these states" (paragraph five) use identical template stems; "the genesis of the shared burdens" in paragraph two stacks abstractions where a concrete image would sharpen; "profound and enveloping calm" in paragraph seven is a label-only emotion. The dream sequence ("shimmering motes of light," "glowing ideograms") layers metaphor densely but remains legible. No paraphrase loops across adjacent lines, and syntax varies without monotony. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "twisted apple trees, their bark pale as bone, spiraled into the maw" delivers setting, tone, and stakes simultaneously). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Paraphrase loop detected: "her purpose here was singular" / "now, it was her only hope" restates the same mission across paragraphs one and two (−0.2). Template cadence in paragraph three: "The first circle touched... The second circle rippled... The third circle breached..." (−0.4). Minor register drift: "sympathetic excavation" and "nexus" slightly jar against the embodied druidic voice (−0.3). Cumulative Q7 deductions total −0.9, placing the score at 6.8 after starting from ~7.7 for strong baseline density and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. "Not there," she whispered, her voice a rustle of leaves—economical and imagistic. No paraphrase loops detected. Minor deductions: "the air, thick with the scent of ozone and night-blooming moonpetals, vibrated with her own anxious elation" stacks modifiers; "Her fingers traced the shimmering, silver traceries" alliterates but borders on ornamental. The phrase "That violent surge had nullified humanity's pact with the Weavers" is expository and slows momentum mid-opening. Proofreading is clean; no tense slips or pronoun ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: "the phosphorescent moss...casting long, skeletal shadows" layers mood and image efficiently. Sentence rhythm varies without template cadence. Minor slack: "a desperate faith in inlaying meaning everywhere" edges toward summary rather than showing through action in that line. One paraphrase near "animate emptiness that sought to trammel" briefly restates the threat. Overall clarity and momentum are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, accelerating during the physical struggle ("He pulled harder, and with a final, ripping sound") and expanding for the memory beat. Information density is high: most lines advance character, setting, and theme simultaneously. The opening "The only sound in the quarry office trailer was the hum of the small bar fridge where Elias kept his lunch" anchors efficiently. Minor template-cadence slip in "He saw Jez... He saw Jez" sequence (two sentences opening identically in the memory paragraph), which triggers a modest deduction but doesn't touch closure. No paraphrase loops; the metaphor chain (fortress, shipwreck, wound) remains coherent. Final line "evidence that there had been a show, and that even after the applause, something always remained" provides strong closure rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Rhythm varies and information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or action. Three distinct issues lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop: "Her motivation was no longer to simply cultivate... but to understand" and "The core of her haunted ambitions was not to get him back, but to prove" restate the same shift across paragraphs. (2) Filter-verb cluster in peak beat: "She believed," "she wondered," "she decided," "She needed" stack in close succession during the analogical breakthrough, dulling immediacy. (3) Stock metaphor: "beautiful, hollow ghosts" is generic. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: −0.8 baseline for loops and filter stacks, with an additional −0.3 for the metaphor cliché, totaling −1.1 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied syntax ("The saltwater had long since receded" / "With the tide at its peak"). Information density is high: most sentences advance atmosphere, mechanics, or transformation. Two minor artifacts: "a creature of pure order" feels label-declarative rather than shown; "empathetic heat that sought out the core of each memory" stacks abstract terms in a peak beat without concrete anchoring. The smelting sequence maintains propulsion, and the final image ("swimming in a slow, contented circle") closes with specificity. No loops or scaffold present.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and the prose is information-dense, but several beats loop concepts: "silence wasn't empty; it was a resonant hush" rephrases itself immediately, and "the low hum" recurs without added detail. The hesitation sentence ("his entire life played out: his oath...the logic...the crushing loneliness...and the desperate, foolish dream") lists rather than dramatizes. Stock phrasing appears: "universe of deferred futures," "condensed glow of a thousand forfeited futures." The final image is vivid but the lead-in ("terrifying and beautiful") tells emotion rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Propulsive and dense with no paraphrase loops. "The world felt like sandpaper" and "broken lung that could still...breathe a fractured tune" are specific and voice-matched. Information layering is strong: each sentence advances setting, interiority, or symbolic charge. The accordion sequence—"single, long, wheezing note...a raw solace that didn't fix anything but acknowledged everything"—is rhythmically controlled without overwriting. Zero filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Figurative language (sandpaper nerves, forgotten headstone, tributary of grief) remains coherent and sparse.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished and generally clear, but multiple artifacting patterns accumulate: paraphrase loops ("the place she had only seen in sleep" / "the glowing library in mist" echo each other), elevated metaphor density in nearly every sentence ("archive of echoes," "ghostly after-images," "cathedral of his regret") without pattern-teaching or payoff, and template cadence in the watch-description beat ("Its face was polished obsidian, its hands carved from bone, and it did not measure..."). The final paragraph stacks three metaphoric constructions in rapid succession ("shield but a relic," "coming dawn," "silent, backward shudder") that blur rather than sharpen the closure image. These artifacts do not break causality but measurably dull line-level propulsion and clarity at the ending, triggering cumulative deductions and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is strong: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or conflict. Clean grammar and coherent spatial choreography. Two minor issues: "mulberry ache" recurs identically in first and final paragraphs without clear reweighting mid-scene (acceptable lyric reprise, but slight missed opportunity for evolution); "the pain of this choice, standing here in the velvet dark with two futures before him" is a small paraphrase of the prior paragraph's tension. Overall propulsion is solid with no loops that obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or action. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor overwriting: "the great, star-dusted oblivion," "symphony of noise without form," and stacked metaphors ("liquid light, a current of warmth and gold") cluster in the infusion beat, adding slight figurative density without breaking clarity. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the final paragraph's anaphoric "some…others…some" is purposeful rather than scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm varies and most lines advance character or atmosphere. Information density is high in the middle climb passage. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She was not a passive observer; she was a participant" restates the prior sentence's "trust the process without interference" contrast. The opening's "a seed seeking light" and the ending's "she had become it" rely on metaphor that verges on generic. Minor scaffold: "the whole, intricate dance of existence" is a stock phrase. The scalloping beat is clean and propulsive, which anchors the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing images are sharp. Information density is high: most lines do two jobs (e.g., "salt-eaten iron" anchors both age and maritime setting). Sentence openings vary well across the piece. Two line-level issues: "As the dawn bled purple and gold across the horizon, a sharp, metallic clang" buries the clang's urgency in a scenic clause. "He looked from the hollow shard to the heavy, fur-lined cloak he wore, a mantle of his wealth and power" tells the cloak's symbolic freight rather than trusting the earlier description and upcoming action. Minor filter-verb reliance ("I watched," "I explained") is voice-consistent but could sharpen immediacy in one or two high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful overall ("starlight sharp enough to cut," "fish in murky water"). However, template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "He saw paths not taken…He saw his own desperate desire…He was too present." The closure beat—"The last ripple collapsed…the pond was once again a perfect, dark mirror. The trance was broken."—uses simple, clear syntax that supports the moment. Minor scaffold in "her core motivation laid bare like a polished stone" tells rather than letting the next action show. Information density is high; no paraphrase loops detected, but the stacked "He saw / He was" pattern and one decorative aphorism lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmic with strong imagery ("vertebra the size of a millstone," "dusk-ravens... a living cloud of black"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor text-pattern issues: "The method was an ancient one: to read the answer through the patterns in a flock" is slightly expository scaffold, and the phrase "weathered resolve in their eyes" at the very end is a label rather than embodied image. The arrowhead sequence has one paraphrase loop ("It was obsidian, chipped with a desperate precision... This was the source, or at least its anchor" restates urgency without added detail). No major loops or register drift. Sentence openings vary and paragraph structure supports rhythm. The closure image ("profound stillness") is somewhat abstract but the prior line ("contented sigh... clear and pure") anchors it concretely enough.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (mist-walking, diagnostic failure, unstrapping all advance character and stakes). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Clarity is strong until the final paragraph, where stacked abstractions ("sacred," "resonance," "unshakeable light," "way of seeing") and the summary-like closure line dilute propulsion. The phrase "the most powerful magic of all" reads as scaffold—tell where image would suffice. Sentence variety is solid, but the ending's conceptual cluster slightly flattens momentum and lowers density when it should peak.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies well; no loops or scaffold. Line-level clarity is high, though a few constructions lean ornamental: "a phantom preceding the light he carried" (opener), "the shape of it, the feeling of its vibration" (double near-synonym). The library description is lush but stalls momentum before the payoff. Figurative density is controlled except in the penultimate paragraph, where "the impression of one," "blooming and fading," and "soft and certain as a held breath" cluster without clear propulsion. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level clarity and momentum are strong. Information density is high: "ambered field," "stellar doubt," "uncoin the void" each do multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Minor overwriting in "crush of bruised light and screaming physics" (two metaphors in quick succession) and "billion ghosts" (slight hyperbole that risks sentimentality). The backwards-prophecy quotation's elevated register is justified. One small scaffold phrase: "In the old, sprawling universe, a man might seek…" could be tighter. These keep the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies effectively, and information density is high throughout. Minor figurative overload in the opening third: "silent apocalypse," "shoreless sea," "vast and monstrous geography" cluster without clear intensification. The phrase "hollowed out by a grief he had no name for" is later echoed in "nameless, drowning fear," creating slight synonym drift. Sentence openings vary, and spatial choreography (Kael's hand, the prism, the console) tracks cleanly. The final image is concrete and charged. No loops or template cadence, but the accumulation of elevated metaphors in the first 200 words slightly dilutes momentum before the ritual begins.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. The metaphor cluster in the opening paragraph ("pilot light," "missing note," "elegy") is dense but coherent and voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The phrase "It was a foolish, grandiose ambition…yet his earnest naivete shielded him" edges toward mild scaffold, but the prose remains propulsive. Zero artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor stakes and image. Information density is high: most lines advance character, discovery, or theme. Clarity throughout; no loops or paraphrase. Minor: "A fiction designed to shield a child from the truth of a hero who had actually drowned trying to save one last family who had refused to leave" is a long, clause-stacked sentence that slightly slows momentum in a key reveal. One instance of mild filter stacking ("his grandfather, sitting on the porch, spinning a tale") but voice-motivated. No artifacts touch closure. Propulsion strong.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentence openings are diverse. However, figurative density is high throughout without always advancing pressure: "ghost in his perfect equations," "precise cage of his own intellect," "living cloud," "dark river in the sky," "sea of logic." In the closure beat, "rigid scaffolding of his logic dissolved into the flowing grace" mixes metaphors (scaffolding doesn't dissolve; liquids flow, structures don't). Paraphrase loop appears: "he felt trapped in the precise cage" echoes "precise cage of his own intellect." Template cadence in middle section: "At first, he tried... He let go... The flock swirled..." Apply −0.6 for figurative muddle and loop; −0.3 for template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings differ, and information density is high. The buckle sequence shows strong propulsion: "Click, pull, check" compresses technique without losing clarity. Minor issues: "the knowledge settled in his gut like a stone" is a stock metaphor; "His fingers flew across the console" approaches cliché. The final paragraph's "soundless echo" motif charges closure effectively. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies moderately; sentence openings show some diversity. Clarity is high and information density is good in the vivify sequence. However, several loops and scaffold patterns appear: "fear of the unknown, fear of a consciousness unbound" is paraphrase within a line; "It was not a resurrection of his old self, but the birth of another" restates the prior "newborn" image without added pressure; "not joy, not peace, but…" is a stock negation structure. Elevated diction ("coalescing," "nascent," "convulsed") holds but does not vary under stress. Filter verbs ("He saw," "He felt") cluster in the climax. These patterns dull immediacy and prevent high-band entry; apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.3)
    Figurative language is dense ("silence so dense it felt like a physical weight," "dust motes danced," "ghost of an effort") but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Two paraphrase loops: "symbols of their stagnant grief" echoes "emblems of the family's neglect" within two lines; "the sound of him" restates the lullaby idea just after "cadence of her husband's humming." Template stems ("He gathered… He poured… He began…") create minor cadence monotony in the engine-start sequence. Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere and action simultaneously. No major opacity or scaffold, but the accumulation of loops and stems merits −0.6 under the patterned-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or pressure. Rhythm varies and figurative language ("the garden's frost was the ice in his own veins") is coherent. Clarity holds. Weaknesses: paragraph three uses "a corrupted echo of the pathways between worlds" and "desperate ambition" in close succession, slightly overwriting the pendant's introduction. Paragraph four recycles "the boundaries of light" and "fog of his existence" within two sentences, creating mild synonym drift. No major loops or template cadence, but these slips prevent entry to the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and rhythmic with strong momentum: "He began the familiar, painful process" → detailed attempt → "Failure number seventy-two." Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, world, or pressure. Two minor loops: "each failed experiment felt like a small death" and "each failure…felt more inevitable" restate emotional impact; "He had been trying…He had been acting" uses parallel template stems. The closure image ("a single, intricate flower, its petals like spun moonlight") is vivid but leans slightly purple with stacked modifiers. No major artifacts touch the ending. One metaphor muddle: "his hope was a ghost, a faint outline" mixes immateriality with visual form.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., fragment description conveys both physicality and thematic charge). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity is strong through the technical sequence. Minor scaffold: "With a surge of defiant practicality, she decided on a new method" tells the shift rather than enacting it, and "The city of towers was silent around her, but for the first time, it didn't feel abandoned. It felt like it was waiting" pairs two telling beats that could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high. Minor scaffold appears: "a feeling of permanent transient washing over him" is abstract and could be cut; "It all fit together; he was seeing the world via interconnected patterns" tells what the prior sentences showed. The phrase "slide out of reality, like a bead of water skittering off a waxed leaf" is vivid, but "didn't so much vanish as it did slide" is a hedged opener. No loops or template cadence that obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor overwriting in figurative density: "fever dream architect," "rational enchantment," "texture of connection," "equation made manifest" cluster without always doing double work. Template cadence appears in adjacent beats: "He worked by weaving… He was a fever dream…" and "The structure grew… This was his life's work…" creating slight momentum drag. No paraphrase loops. The final line "perfectly rational, beautifully enchanted cage" lands cleanly. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clarity and concision are strong; information density is high throughout. Sentence rhythm varies naturally with a few minor template echoes ("He began his work," "He theorized"). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; the metaphoric language (abyss, currents, shorelines) is coherent and extends logically from the navigation premise. The final line—"humanity finally had a new ocean to cross"—charges the closure image without overwriting. One slight register drift: "balancedly curious nature" reads slightly elevated for mid-scene interiority, but it's brief and voice-motivated. Overall propulsion is clean with zero scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the opening and setup. However, several lines loop conceptually: "contact tracer for hearts" / "specialist in the cartography of loss" / "technician of sorrow" restate the same idea without added pressure. "Reeling hush" appears twice in identical phrasing. The phrase "eighty-seven years before she was gone entirely" is opaque on first read. No major template cadence or filter stacks; clarity is generally strong. Modest paraphrase drift and one stock phrase ("moth fluttering against a windowpane") lower the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; information density is high. Strong figurative language: "fossilized leviathans," "jagged mouth of rebar," "probability wave." No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deductions: "crashing hush" appears twice in identical phrasing without pattern-teaching, and "impossibly, blessedly open" stacks modifiers at the closure beat. The phrase "his motivation a burning certainty" tells rather than dramatizes. Otherwise propulsion is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. Opening and closing images bookend effectively. The defragmentation sequence maintains propulsion without loops. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "She was translating digital chaos into physical form so the ghost could recognize itself. For hours, the patterns were meaningless..." uses consecutive explanatory frames that could compress. The phrase "fractured pulse" and "shattered consciousness" recur as near-synonyms within the opening beats. Figurative language ("blooming, dying fractals") is purposeful and legible. No major clarity issues; grammar and tense are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence openings and high information density—most lines advance image, character, or world. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs are present. Figurative language is purposeful: "colossal ribs and vertebrae of leviathans long dead, which clawed at a sky the color of dust." Minor overwriting appears in phrases like "the entire history of my people's speech roaring up from below," which edges toward abstraction without concrete grounding. The climactic beat—diamond alignment, silence, new tone—is clear and propulsive, free of artifacts that would dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., "Elara is less a monster and more a creature of the loam" characterizes both Julian's expectation and Elara's reality). Rhythm varies across beats, tightening during the transformation ("flickered...elongated...branched") and opening for reflection at closure. Minor issues: "static-laden and broken" / "swallowed by the electric snow" in adjacent lines loops the concept slightly, and "damp, cool earth" / "droplets of condensation" / "spores drift" front-loads atmospheric description where economy would tighten. The phrase "a harmony untamed by the sunlit world's rigid physics" tilts abstract but lands early enough to teach the pattern. No major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are mostly distinct. Information density is high in the opening and climax, though the middle summarizes weeks in a single paragraph. Minor loops appear: "a whisper that could slide between the atoms of the air" and "resonantly soft wave" echo each other; "MethodICAL march" pairs with "precise and without soul" in a way that recycles the mechanistic descriptor. The phrase "channeling its fear and hope into the strings" tells rather than shows the conversion. Figurative language is dense but controlled, with one potential muddle: "roots were the source of the orchard's stagnant life" conflates nourishment and suppression without clarifying the mechanism. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual pacing. Information density is high—most lines advance character, action, or atmosphere. The countdown and transfer beat are crisp and propulsive. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor density slip: "It was the key to his respectfully rebellious work, a task he performed with the solemnity of a sacrament" adds two near-synonym phrases ("key"/"task," "respectfully rebellious"/"solemnity of a sacrament") in quick succession without new information. A second instance: "the brittle hush" recurs three times (opening, pre-climax, post-climax) without evolution, approaching template cadence. The figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "a prayer sent...through a loophole" mixes registers slightly. These are hairline slips that do not obscure causality or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with strong sensory detail and varied syntax. Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs. Clarity is consistent. However, some figurative language clusters without tight necessity: "spun moonlight," "halo fragment," "miniature dawn," and "tapestry of wind and light" appear in close proximity during the climactic beat, risking overwriting. "A low, resonant vibration that hadn't been used in a decade, rusty and yet achingly clear" is precise and powerful. Minor paraphrase loop: "the quiet" / "the silence" / "the stillness" / "the misting hush" cycle through the piece as near-synonyms without sharp functional distinctions, applying −0.3 for synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level clarity is strong; information density is high (nearly every sentence advances ritual or stakes). Sentence openings vary effectively, and rhythm accelerates during the climactic beat without sluggishness. Minor deduction: "a figure of observed solitude, content in the silent space" and "a man alone with a universe of secrets" echo each other structurally across the arc, creating a subtle paraphrase loop (−0.2). Figurative language ("cathedral of shelved paradoxes," "saddle-shaped space") remains coherent and voice-motivated. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats. Propulsion is consistent; no scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies, openings shift, figurative language is coherent (cipher, code, tapestry of radiance). Clarity is strong; no loops or scaffold. Minor density slip: "a feeling that had slipped through his fingers upon waking one morning and had been fleeing ever since" restates the "runaway dream" without added pressure. "The aching void in the room was finally filled, the luminous absence transformed into a living, breathing glow" near-duplicates the resolution concept across two clauses. Information density is generally high, but a few phrases could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, opening with sweeping myth-making and tightening during the ritual. Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or mechanics. Minor scaffold appears in synonym clusters ("enveloped secrets," "beautiful, terrible thing") and the phrase "unassumingly bold gesture" front-loads the required attribute awkwardly. One paraphrase loop: "The air grew thin, expectant. Then, it appeared" could compress. Figurative language (starlight "knowing," fear "expecting") is dense but stays coherent. The closure image ("drifting on the solar winds") elevates without muddling.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high with minimal scaffolding; most lines do multiple jobs. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, balancing longer atmospheric passages with sharp beats ("He needed to know"). Minor loop: "Decades later" appears in both the second and final paragraphs, creating echo without added pressure. The phrase "drowned yet defiantly alive" and "defined and damned him" show controlled parallelism. Figurative language ("praying mantis," "priest's hand giving a benediction") remains coherent and sparse. Clarity holds throughout; no artifacts obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high: most lines advance character or atmosphere. The opening image of "skin was a tapestry of fine, silvery scars" is specific and apt. Minor template cadence appears in the middle ("It was his way... He was mentoring... He motioned...") but does not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops. The figurative language cluster in the opening paragraph ("fractures," "tapestry," "shards," "chisel against stone") is dense but coherent and voice-motivated. Final line charges prior motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the ritual sequence (mist, thunder, essence threads, seed pulse). Two penalties: (1) Paraphrase loop—"This seed was an anchor, a promise passed down through time" restates "heirloom seed" without new pressure (−0.2). (2) Stock metaphor string in peak beat: "latent energy that warmed his skin," "captured aurora of impossible beauty," "miniature galaxy of wonder" cluster elevated abstractions without fresh vehicle (−0.4). Clarity remains high; no grammatical errors. The final image ("emerald deepness he had not seen in years") lands with concrete specificity, but the closure beat carries one filter-verb stack ("seemed to shimmer," "seemed to sweeten") that slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and sentences advance scene or atmosphere consistently. Information density is high: "This net is the heart of it all; it accumulates silence, drawing in the quiet moments from the deep sea and the held breaths of forgotten men" does triple work (function, history, stakes). Minor loop: "the unrest" appears three times in close proximity ("lucid unrest," "prickling anxiety," "unrest in the sanctuary sharpened") with synonym churn that could tighten. Template cadence slip: "I retrieved...I explained...I stepped...I told...I chose...I slid...I worked...I focused" creates a modest drumbeat in the ritual sequence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("a shroud," "dam against the tide"), though "interlaced hush" borders on abstract. Overall propulsion is strong; the artifact touches mid-section but not closure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence rhythms. Some overwriting clusters appear: "Her shielded openness, a trait honed by years" front-loads descriptor rather than showing through choice; "the silence of the films screamed at her" is a stock oxymoron. The phrase "whispered chapel" appears as metaphor in the penultimate paragraph but was never earned in scene—it is asserted, not discovered. Information density is strong in the footage-comparison beat. No paraphrase loops, but figurative language in adjacent lines ("a tremor of connection, an empathetic rush") dilutes immediacy in the discovery moment. Apply −0.5 for the overwriting cluster and −0.3 for the unearned chapel metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong imagery ("pages swollen into pale, indecipherable flowers," "spectral sentinels"). Information density is high; beats advance knowledge and atmosphere efficiently. Minor issues: "I felt Mortimer's presence sharpen, his professional curiosity piqued" is slightly filter-heavy and tells what could be shown. The phrase "physics of letting go" appears three times, creating mild conceptual redundancy. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports the meditative tone without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language ("pencil-thin beam," "pregnant with unshed sound") is vivid and advances atmosphere. Sentence openings diversify. Clarity is strong in the ritual choreography. Two issues: minor paraphrase loops—"The mist began to move, no longer drifting aimlessly but swirling" → "It coalesced before him, thinning and thickening"—and a template-cadence stretch in paragraph three ("His ballads were not sung, but drawn... He did not use words, but a complex language..."). These patterns dull momentum slightly but don't obscure causality. Information density is high; no true scaffolding or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create propulsion without template cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance discovery, setting, or emotion. "The wind still howls like a memory" is vivid; "One day we will build a home where the sun is warm on the ground" charges the ending. Minor scaffold: "just as the rumors had suggested" tells rather than dramatizes prior hearsay, and "This was not the diary of a broken captain; it was the sacred text of a mother" edges toward thesis statement. The goggles' mechanics (polarized hues, focused light) ground the speculative element concretely. No loops or paraphrase cycles detected.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence structure shifts from summary ("His work had always been…") to tight observation ("He swept the telescope lower…") to lyric closure ("…endless, echoing beauty of what remained"). Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic charge. Minor loop: "He believed" appears twice in close succession (par. 3 and 4) without added pressure. "Dusty starlight" recurs as motif but does not constrain a choice until closure. Figurative language is dense ("rarefied into a single, crystalline objective," "grieving blanket of a cloud") but remains coherent and voice-motivated; no mixed metaphors. Paragraph cuts are purposeful; no scaffolding or paraphrase loops detected. One template stem: "He [verb]" appears frequently but varies enough to avoid monotony penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (sensory anchoring + temporal pressure + character bias). Sentence variety supports rhythm, and the final image is vivid without overwriting. Minor loop: "the chaos of history scored into its metal" and "a scratch from being dropped in a forgotten market, a tiny pit from a chemist's acid" both describe the coin's marks, though the second adds specificity. A few elevated constructions ("cerulean light bled," "fractally precise veins") work for the moment but cluster near closure, risking density. One template stem repeats ("a way to trap," "a map of infinity") without cost. No significant artifacts obscure causality or dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high across most beats. Sentence openings shift purposefully. The hopscotch insight and bird-reading sequences propel without padding. Figurative language is controlled: "starlings pulsed in a single, fluid body," "celestial breadcrumb trail." Two frictions lower the grade: (1) Paraphrase loop in the opening: "His world was a bubble...suspended in an endless ocean of blue" followed by "His days were marked by a profound yet sociable isolation" restates the isolation theme without added pressure (−0.3). (2) Template cadence in the climax: "He began to note...He watched...He began to note...sketching furiously" repeats "He [verb]" stems across four lines during peak pressure (−0.5). Stock phrase "with the force of a lightning strike" is functional but generic. No loops touch the closure image. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in key beats (the vial uncapping, the keyhole reveal). However, elevated diction pervades even high-pressure moments: "the hauntingly bright glare faltered" and "a sigh of meshing metal" feel ornamental rather than urgent. Minor paraphrase loop: "forgotten knowledge was sealed in ice" echoes "crystalline stasis" without added pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "The mirrors shimmered... The gears... began to turn... Light... poured." Some figurative language (frost "like shed skin") works, but the density of metaphor occasionally slows propulsion rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence openings and no major loops. Minor overwriting in peak beats: "symphony of desperation and trust," "wave of pure sound that shook the very dust from the air" layer metaphor without adding causal detail. The phrase "Hope was a story they told each other" and "her faith a fragile shield" rely on stock constructions. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but density could be tighter in the climb sequence where physical micro-movements are narrated without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied, with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high in the ritual sequence ("nested patterns," "fractal of luminescence," "filigrees"). Sentence openings vary and paragraph structure supports the accumulative build. Two frictions: "beautifully flawed" recurs as a phrase-template in two separate sentences, creating mild synonym-loop effect; "It was" constructions appear three times in quick succession in paragraph three ("It was a breathtaking...It was the feeling...It was a gift"), producing a brief template-cadence run that dulls momentum. No clarity loss at closure, so deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, action, or atmosphere without padding. Opening and closing images are strong. Minor loop: "weary resignation" (paragraph 2) and "weary nonchalance" (final assembly line) restate the same emotional note without added nuance, costing ~−0.2. A second minor echo: "graceless beauty" appears identically in the assembly paragraph and the final line, trending toward template cadence in a high-pressure closure beat, costing an additional −0.3. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; no artifacts obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the foam paragraph uses longer, linked clauses to mirror the observation process. Information density is high—most lines advance both interiority and thematic image. However, scaffold and near-paraphrase appear: "His grief… felt raw" in paragraph two, then "The knot of grief… loosened" at closure recycles the grief-knot metaphor without enough transformation between uses. "He had only ever seen… missing the poetry entirely" tells what the prior sentence showed. Stock metaphor: "lightning strike but as a slow, widening dawn" is functional but not fresh. Figurative density (chrysalis, river, foam, chains, cathedral, knot) risks overwriting but remains mostly coherent. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clarity and information density are strong; most lines advance atmosphere or character. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates appropriately. Minor figurative density in the opening third ("tapestry woven from disconnected points," "canvas underneath") approaches ornament but remains coherent. The phrase "a kind of glimmering parole, a temporary release from the overwhelming weight of every story ever told" is register-elevated exposition that intrudes on momentum during the measurement sequence. No loops or scaffold; pronoun references are clean. The incision sequence is vivid and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.7)
    Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("desert's long history," "blizzard of grief"). Sentence rhythm varies and propels. Two frictions: "the brittle parts of him finally gone" after "terrifyingly smooth" is near-paraphrase; "the collective sorrow was a physical pressure" leans abstract where embodied sensation would sharpen. The pavilion's dissolution sequence is vivid and kinetic. No loops or template cadence in peak beats, though some metaphors cluster heavily in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors. Information density is high in the opening third. However, paraphrase loops appear: "He was building a bridge of shared heritage, reminding the silos of their common roots" restates what the action already shows. Template cadence surfaces in the climax section with repetitive "he [verb]" constructions across multiple sentences. Stock metaphors ("metallic teardrop," "storm of psychic noise") and elevated register in peak beats ("empathetically decisive move") slightly dull immediacy. The final paragraph summarizes rather than trusting the image, adding scaffold. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and loops.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and sentence openings vary, but figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "canyon walls were pages," "moonlight was silver ink," "swimming through a storm of ghosts," "hammer blow forging new connections." Mixed vehicles (walls as pages, moonlight as ink, periscope as time-viewer) remain legible but crowd the frame. Template cadence appears in the setup paragraph: "Her motivation was... Her process was... The tone of the cavern was..." (three "X was Y" constructions). Paraphrase loop: "entangled memories" recurs three times in adjacent beats without added pressure. Apply −0.6 for density + template stems; no artifacts touch closure directly, so mid-6 band remains accessible.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance situation or atmosphere. Minor artifacts: "clandestineyl" (typo), and the phrase "the synthesis of ideas so potent they had been deliberately scattered" reads slightly expository in the opening beat. A brief paraphrase loop appears in paragraph two ("The familiar, gut-lurching heave began" followed by immediate description of the same event). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "latent blaze" recurs without muddle. Propulsion is strong in the final scramble.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—lines carry setting, character motive, and thematic weight simultaneously. No loops or scaffold. However, the passage "She was no longer just a sculptor; she was a conductor weaving a living tapestry of sound" verges on summary rather than dramatizing the shift. A few phrases lean slightly elevated ("the slow, persistent reach for the sun") without breaking voice. The opening and closing lines anchor cleanly, with "The world was no longer quiet. It was listening" recharging the silence motif.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with strong imagery (bloated purple sun, ghostly ribbons, silent music). Information density is high; most lines advance understanding or atmosphere. Minor loop: "the silence" / "silences" / "quiet" / "stillness" cycle across paragraphs 3–4 with some synonym churn. The "thoughtfully precise methodology" phrase and "breathtaking structure began to emerge" lean slightly abstract when concrete chess-mapping detail would sharpen. Sentence variety supports rhythm; no major artifacts touch closure. Figurative language (checkmate, symphony) is coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythms vary purposefully, and figurative language (foghorn sorrow, sun-warmed stone) stays coherent without mixed metaphors. Information density is high in the tuning sequence. Two issues prevent higher: the phrase "recovering that silent feeling was enough" is scaffolding summary mid-closure; and "a surge of insight, he twisted the dial" tells the pivot rather than showing perceptual cues that trigger it. No loops or template cadence weaken the ending beat, so penalties stay modest.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the wind's arrival ("riot of smells," stacked sensory details) and breathing at resolution. Information density is high: "damp moss within her treetop conservatory" anchors multiple facts in one image. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor deduction: occasional figurative density without clear payoff ("storm cloud in the otherwise clear sky of her focus") and one filter-verb cluster during the peak beat ("threatened to overwhelm," "urged to flee") slightly reduce propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("the world turned upside down with a grace that defied its own violence"). Information density is high; sentence-level clarity is strong. However, two adjacent sentences in the opening para restate the Inversion idea ("the world turned upside down" / "Dust motes…began their slow, upward spiral"), a minor paraphrase loop. The phrase "This was the hidden path" / "This was the place" / "This was her window" recurs as a template stem across beats, creating scaffold cadence. No major artifacts touch closure, but the patterns reduce propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm modulates with scene pressure; opening sensory density ("haze tasted of salt and rust") gives way to technical precision ("micro-anemometers, thin as needles") and then to weighted finality ("the knowledge was a weight heavier than all the steel"). Information density is high; most lines advance investigation, discovery, or stakes. Minor deductions: "Days bled into a gray continuum" is a stock temporal phrase, and "His work gained a new, frantic energy" tells emotional shift rather than showing it through altered action or perception. No loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.7)
    Figurative language is dense throughout ("a river of impossible greens," "wave of verdant light that tasted of new grass"), creating cumulative overwriting without pattern-teaching or payoff that alters tactics (−0.5 in Q7). Paraphrase loops appear: "sculpted hush" is restated as "manufactured quiet," "oppressive…quiet," and "living stillness" without advancing pressure. Sentence openings vary, but the mythic register flattens momentum in the ritual sequence. Information density is moderate; most lines serve atmosphere over plot advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives ("He had been a fool") contrast with longer lyric constructions. Information density is high; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or ritual. Minor loop: "The guardianship was never about keeping the worlds separate. It was about maintaining the harmony..." could compress to one sentence. Template cadence appears briefly: "He had failed... He had played... He had been..." (three parallel past-perfect constructions in close succession). No major clarity issues; spatial choreography of the spiral and flute handling tracks cleanly. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language (topaz catching starlight "like honey," lead slugs "clicking like bones") is controlled and specific. Two micro-loops appear: "singularity" and "perfect, unbroken curve" restate the same geometric idea adjacently; "the shape of it" echoes "architecture of their feelings" within three lines. The final paragraph stacks two "she realized" constructions. No clarity loss at closure, but density wavers slightly under pressure. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and sentences open distinctly. "The shale shifted" / "His breath plumed" / "Above, the aurora shimmered" shows controlled cadence. Information density is high in the climax (phantoms, Elara, germination). Two scaffold issues: "a testament to" recurs (nervous rhythm, what had happened), and "not just the destination" / "not at him but up at the sky" / "not in the way he understood it" / "not a routine" stacks negation-as-clarification across the piece. "Impossibly delicate" and "otherworldly glow" are stock descriptors. Propulsion is strong; no loops touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm accelerates during the communion beat ("spear of pale light struck the prism, exploding into a rainbow") and slows for the recognition ("jagged, unmistakable diagram"). Information density is high: nearly every line advances Elias's theory, the experimental setup, or the revelation. Minor loop: "shifted hush" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs with near-identical phrasing ("shifted hush, the sound of a held world" / "the shifted hush now an empty, ringing void")—the second recurrence adds meaning but the stem repetition slightly dulls momentum. Zero filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops elsewhere, and metaphors are coherent ("spear," "ghost of a rainbow").

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop or lean on stock metaphors: "wistful ache," "shimmering, silent threads," "gossamer connection," "ancient grace." The phrase "stoically sparkling" appears twice (bead description, then "stoically sparkling fleck") in close proximity without added meaning. Opening and closing lines are strong, but mid-passage template cadence ("The scent of his hair..., the specific cadence of his laugh, the warmth of his hand") and synonym churn around "silence" (raveling, absolute, solid wall, whole) reduce propulsion. Figurative density in the final paragraph (nova, masterpiece, breathtaking map, profound longing, peacefully alone) risks overwriting without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong rhythm: "sifting a fine dust that soured the fruit," "state caught precisely between understanding and confusion." Information density is high. Minor loop: "quiet, defiant blue" echoes "quietly determined" and "defiance" recurs, edging toward template cadence in the final paragraph. One filter-verb cluster ("felt a profound sense of loss, a fading") in the climax slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or major scaffold; sentence openings vary.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor slip: "a tide that ebbed and flowed on a schedule only the universe knew" is slightly ornamental, and "the weight of a withheld truth" recurs without clear escalation. The closure image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clarity and concision are strong; most sentences do double work (e.g., "a cold weight in his pocket" anchors object and emotional state). Rhythm varies purposefully—short action beats in the storm, longer reflective sentences at the ending. Minor scaffold: "a strange and fragile intimacy, a bond woven from distance and silence" paraphrases within the same paragraph. The phrase "luminescent ache" appears twice in close proximity (once as tone anchor, once in final image); the second use is earned but the recurrence slightly dulls the payoff. No filter-verb stacks, loops, or template cadence. Information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Figurative language is dense ("spear of green," "contained nova," "tapestry of light and shade") and occasionally overwrought in high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching; the metaphor "cathedral of light and shadow" sits beside "symphony of chaos" in adjacent lines, risking decorative stacking (−0.3). Paraphrase loops are minimal; no scaffold or template cadence. Information density is solid but the overwriting in the storm sequence nudges the score down from 7+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail (microscopic ridges, chalk dust, curling steam) is concrete. Two text-artifact issues prevent higher scoring: "quietly explosive" appears as a label without embodied proof in peak beats, and the phrase "valley-mist wonder" recurs decoratively. Minor paraphrase loop in paragraph four ("hesitate, to bend and pool...uncertain arcs") restates light behavior across adjacent clauses. No egregious scaffold, but these slips total −0.3 to −0.4, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives ("The storm passed") contrast with longer accretions ("a silent film projected from the sorrow-shard"). Information density is high; nearly every line advances the process or charges an object. Opening and closing images are strong: dust motes to mosaic spiral. Minor scaffold appears in "he had learned" and "he had done it"—two past-perfect anchors that could be tightened. The metaphor "the labyrinth's cool, stone throat" is vivid but the stacked descriptors in "a soft, forgiving light" and "steady, pearlescent glow" edge toward over-modification. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level clarity is high; sentences propel and rhythm varies. No major loops or scaffold. However, figurative density is elevated throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "heavy cloak," "seeds in barren soil," "spider's thread," "graveyard of her thoughts," "abstract painting of hope" crowd the text, occasionally muddling rather than sharpening (e.g., "bound release" as tone is abstract). Some stock constructions ("sharp as a thorn," "color of ash") and elevated diction in peak beats ("nascent sun," "vortex of burgeoning energy") reduce immediacy. No paraphrase loops detected, but the metaphor density triggers a modest deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high: most lines advance interiority, setting, or thematic charge. Rhythm varies (clipped during hiding, expansive at closure). Minor artifacts: "Here, in this library..." and "He was a compassionate recluse, a paradox he lived with daily" read slightly expository; "the central paradox of his life resolved itself" names the thematic hinge rather than trusting the image. "Staying while leaving" is repeated identically at open and close, a purposeful frame but also a template anchor. No paraphrase loops or severe muddle, but the final paragraph's "another story resting peacefully" metaphor is self-consciously literary.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is controlled with strong imagery: "Moss ate the marble," "a fossil from a forgotten age," "a tender sort of defiance." Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high. Minor pattern: "She had decided," "She had not been," "she had found"—three past-perfect constructions in key beats create a slight template cadence. The metaphor "ivy scaled the walls, a slow green conquest" works, but "the air had grown thin since the birds flew south" opens with an abstract claim that lacks immediate grounding. No loops or major scaffolding; clarity holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short bursts during the flare: "Then, the light died. The projection vanished."). Information density is high: most lines advance image, action, or thematic charge. Figurative language ("guttering candle flame," "symphony collapsing into discordant noise") is controlled and specific. Minor artifact cluster: "His task, and his penance" / "His motivation was not to halt" / "His goal was to measure" / "His fingers flew" stack possessive constructions across the middle third, creating mild template cadence. Paraphrase loop: "a cartographer of a collapsing reality" and "the slow unraveling…into forgotten mist" restate the premise without added pressure. Deduction: −0.6 for template stems and loop; artifacts do not touch closure but reduce mid-momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Opening and closing images are strong. No paraphrase loops or major template cadence. Minor texture issues: "a ghost in homespun" and "chips of obsidian" are vivid but border on stock metaphor; "her attribute of being curiously steadfast shining through" is scaffold-y exposition mid-beat. The phrase "the thing he was trying to sell" in the penultimate decision beat is slightly generic where precision would heighten the turn. Otherwise clean propulsion and no line-level drag.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several passages show elevated figurative clustering without full payoff: "terrestrially cosmic energy," "celestial curtain call," "vessels" as metaphor for carriers. The tin ring's "frantic dance of obsolete technology" and "phantom harbor" read as decorative rather than propulsive. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Syntax varies effectively. Minor register drift (e.g., "an emergent compass…a biological system that oriented a person") into academic exposition mid-scene slightly flattens momentum. The final paragraph's metaphoric density ("map written in lightning and rain") charges closure but risks purple-prose proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Information density is high (most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere). Figurative language is selective and grounded ("falling star" tear, "prismatic audience"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting: "a million facets of light" and "dawn and twilight combined" in the opening paragraph stack metaphor without payoff at that moment, and "glimmering with a light that was like dawn and twilight combined" is slightly redundant with "prismatic" and "crystalline hum." The phrase "charcoal-fingered delicacy" is precise. Sequence clarity is maintained; no simultaneity errors. The opening anchors voice and the final line recharges "light." Overall propulsion is strong with one dense figurative cluster early.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and clarity remains strong throughout. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or template cadence detected. The figurative language ("sweet poison," "hope bloomed," "breathtaking rush") is slightly elevated but controlled and voice-consistent. One small weakness: "the gesture lost in the clamor" uses passive construction where active might sharpen. The final line ("as if a million tiny, truthful conversations were just beginning to sprout") risks softness but remains legible and image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is largely clean, with strong specific verbs ("hauled," "erected," "stirred"). The opening efficiently anchors setting and concept; the final image of searching the horizon provides visual closure. Two friction points: "keening wind" and "frozen tears" are stock metaphors that don't sharpen the moment, and the phrase "the color of wonder in a world that had settled into a uniform grey of knowing" in paragraph two uses an abstract metaphor that slightly muddles sense (does "color" mean variety or emotion? does "grey" mean sameness or cynicism?). The succession "He worked…He did not forge…He shaped…Each slice…The process" in paragraph three shows minor template cadence with repeated "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems, though not egregious.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies; information density is high with most lines doing double duty (advancing plot and character). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity is strong throughout; action order tracks cleanly. Minor overwriting in the climax: "The chaos coalesces. It fights, writhing like a living thing before being crushed inward, compressed under the impossible pressure of my will and the geothermal furnace" stacks metaphors ("coalesces," "crushed inward," "compressed") without added pressure, costing ~−0.3. Otherwise, propulsion is excellent and no scaffold remains.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (locket description, clue assembly, lock mechanism) without padding. Figurative language ("sandstorm calm," "swirling anxiety," "breadcrumb") occasionally clusters but remains legible. Minor loop detected: "The healing had already begun, proving the truth he held so dear" recaps the premise stated earlier without added pressure, costing −0.2. A few filter constructions ("he knew," "he believed," "he saw") dilute immediacy in non-peak moments. Proofreading is clean, and the final image (neighbors talking of Gable's kindness) recharges the opening locket detail, though the closing summary ("proving the truth") tells rather than trusts the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies, sentence openings are diverse, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("spider spins its web," "constellation, part-equation"). Two modest concerns: "encrypt vulnerability as strength" and "ultimate act of translation" edge toward abstract theme-speak in high beats, and the phrase "shared soul made whole" in the final paragraph tilts slightly telling. No loops or scaffold detected. Information density is high, propulsion steady through the dance and dice sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual momentum. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere. The opening ("curdling from peace into a shared, held breath") and closing image (salt crystals "glittering indifferently") are strong. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity is consistent. Minor deductions: "These fields, normally as ephemeral as heat haze, now congealed with a strange permanence that fluctuates mysteriously" stacks modifiers and slightly blurs sense under pressure. The phrase "brought near by the whale's influence" tells rather than shows causality. "The dark sediment had formed a spiral, a tight galaxy with a dense, knotted core" is vivid but the doubled metaphor (spiral/galaxy) slightly muddies. Figurative language density in the climax is high but mostly coherent. Total artifact penalty: −0.3 for minor stacking and one tell-not-show moment.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual flow. Information density is high in the ritual sequence, where each line advances method and effect. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "smoothed hush" recurs with near-synonyms ("profound and overwhelming peace," "placid inferno consuming noise," "silence expanded"), and the closure paragraph summarizes rather than tightens ("work done," "silent guardian," "until…again"). Minor figurative muddle: "tranquil blaze" and "placid inferno" are oxymorons used to atmospheric effect, but "star about to fold into itself" and "terrestrially cosmic" stretch coherence without clear payoff. No major artifact or template cadence, but paraphrase loops and elevated diction in peak beats warrant penalty under Q7 routing.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies well ("She believed every brick held a whisper, every floorboard a memory" versus short declaratives at closure). Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs. Two minor loop issues: "the comfortable illusion" / "silent sanctuary of denial" restate within two paragraphs, and "patiently nimble" appears twice as a descriptor without evolving meaning (−0.4 paraphrase/template). Figurative language is controlled and voice-consistent; no filter-verb stacks or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.6)
    Syntax varies and sentences are grammatically clean. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmosphere or theme rather than advancing action. Minor loops: "isolation"/"independent" recurs across beats without added nuance; "ghostly resolve" shifts to "quiet strength" as synonym replacement. Figurative language is dense ("sky the color of a deep bruise," "captured starlight") and sometimes stacked without causal pressure. No major artifacts touch closure, but paragraph-level momentum sags under decorative weight in the setup and middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, world, or pressure. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the execution beat and breathing at closure. Figurative language ("pearl twilight," "patient heartbeat," "comma of liberation") is vivid and coherent, though density is elevated throughout without pattern-teaching or stark contrast. One paraphrase micro-loop: "years studying... He knew the secret" and "exact pressure of his quill" restate expertise adjacently (−0.2). Filter verbs are voice-motivated and sparse. Spatial and temporal logic is clear; no pronoun ambiguity. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge the stalactite motif effectively. Grammar and punctuation are clean. Proofreading solid. The elevated diction sustains across the piece without modulation for urgency, a minor momentum note, but the closure image remains charged.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "shape of the silence it left behind" echoes "silent spaces between the stars," and "question given form" / "answer" / "melody of acceptance" form a rhetorical chain that slightly dulls propulsion. The opening and closing images are strong, but mid-story scaffold ("This was the method," "She understood then") intrudes with expository clarity that undercuts immediacy. No major artifact in the closure beat, but cumulative minor loops merit modest deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong figurative language ("human eclipse," "smile that doesn't reach his eyes"). However, several lines carry overwriting or near-redundancy: "delicate art, conducted in a trance state" could be tightened; "shimmering ocean" and "tide of slumbering minds" repeat the water metaphor within two sentences; "the profound lightness of a soul released" edges into abstract summary. Template cadence appears in the dream-cameo list ("He stands… he watches… He never speaks"). Information density is high, but a paraphrase loop around the man's "carefully constructed excuse" and "manufactured dream" slightly dulls momentum. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and auditory propulsion. Information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally dense at peaks ("scintillatingly somber," "shimmering, shifting net," "living knots")—three metaphors in close succession without muddling coherence, staying within acceptable pattern-taught bounds. One minor slip: "demure audacity" in paragraph four reads slightly forced, a hedged oxymoron that could be sharper. Proofreading is clean; grammar and punctuation are consistent. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance investigation, setting, or understanding. The reassembly sequence compresses three days efficiently without losing concrete detail. Sentence rhythm varies well except for a cluster of "Kaelen [verb]" constructions in the final section (walked, climbed, raised, shifted, lowered) that create brief template cadence. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; technical terminology (stillpoint, isotopic decay, asymmetrical lattice) serves character expertise. The opening and closing images (perimeter/rustling leaves) bookend effectively. One minor clarity slip: "using it to focus the ambient light onto the ground below" could be more precise about the optical mechanism, though context makes the action legible.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive in many beats ("spire of pitted iron piercing the churning cloud-sea," "shepherd of ghosts"). Information density is high. However, template cadence appears: "His motivation was a simple, terrible thing," "His rise as a prophet had begun," "His growing flock below acted"—three consecutive paragraphs open with possessive + abstract noun, creating rhythmic monotony. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled; "bruised-indigo" and "woven starlight" work, though "static to speak" borders cliché. No paraphrase loops detected. Sentence variety is present but the scaffold opening pattern in the second quarter lowers momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the collection sequence. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence in the opening and closing thirds without clear pattern-teaching: "whisper of wind through dune grass," "grey silk," "dusty fingers of gold," "ethereal harmony," "fleeting, beautiful resonance." The music box's silence described as "the dense, weighted silence of a child's silenced joy" stacks abstraction on metaphor without concrete anchor. Minor template cadence appears in the jar-collection paragraph ("He captured... He held... He collected..."). These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull momentum in peak beats, preventing entry to the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in mechanical beats ("attuning the Heart's baseline resonance to the key's immutable pitch"). However, multiple sentences open with similar stems: "She began," "She reached," "She knew," "She felt," creating template cadence across the middle third. Two paraphrase loops: "economy born of endless repetition" echoes the earlier "lifetime learning to conduct," and the explanation of vibrational matching partially repeats itself across two paragraphs. "Fleshly ethereal" is a mixed metaphor—flesh connotes material weight while ethereal implies weightlessness—muddling the sensory target. The final image is clean and propulsive, keeping the score above 6.0.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong opening and closing lines with good propulsion. However, several paraphrase loops and template patterns appear: "Her impatience was a wild animal clawing at her ribs, an old fury she was learning to tame" immediately followed by clarification of "her true motivation"; "The wildness inside her yearned to smash the instruments" restates the earlier wild animal concept; "This feeling was the true enemy" over-explains. The phrase "the entire tone of their uprising" breaks fourth wall with meta-commentary. Filter-verb reliance in places ("she saw," "she watched") when immediacy would serve better. Metaphor density high but mostly coherent; "a spine of black iron" for viaduct works visually.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clear, rhythmic, and purposeful with strong imagery ("sun never touches," "fortress around a core of sudden, jarring vulnerability"). Information density is high; most sentences advance character or plot. Two minor issues: "a quiet, steady burn in his gut" and "oppressive weight…begin to lift" are near-cliché constructions, and the phrase "a story that demanded a conclusion" in paragraph five edges toward meta-commentary. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports momentum. The closure image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies well; sensory detail is strong ("felt hammers," "molten silver"). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Deductions: mild overwriting in the opening ("Dust motes, ancient and golden, danced... each one a silent story") and the closure beat ("deep and resonant as a cello's final note," "warming his weary spirit")—figurative density clusters without escalating pressure. Stock phrase "the calm before realization" appears in both the narrative and as a required timeframe element, reading slightly templated. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts, but the metaphor load in key beats reduces propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm varies naturally: short urgent beats during the fall ("The wind howled. The acid sea rushed up.") contrast with longer reflective passages in the workshop. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, world, or stakes. Minor filter-verb reliance ("he felt more than saw," "he believed") slightly dulls immediacy in the workshop section but does not touch the closure. "Metallic sculpture of a paradox" and "fossilized command" are vivid and apt. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The final image ("suspended fifty feet above the fuming acid") is concrete and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    Clarity and concision are strong in action beats: "She clicked 'forward.' The data packet, Julian's last words, shot out of the archive and into the world." Rhythm varies across the piece, though a cluster of mid-length declaratives in the opening two paragraphs creates mild template cadence. Minor paraphrase loop: "Her search took her across the echo of forgotten songs" in paragraph two, then "in the echo of forgotten songs" in the final line—the callback is purposeful but the phrasing is identical, reducing density. Stock metaphor: "a sharp pinprick of light in the digital gloom" is functional but generic. Filter-verb stack: "She had to lie, a clean, simple falsehood that felt like a betrayal" uses three abstract descriptors in sequence where embodied tension would sharpen the beat. The phrase "obsessive motivation to find where deleted files go" in the final paragraph summarizes rather than trusts prior dramatization. No grammar errors; pronoun references remain clear. Information density is high in the coordinate discovery and Void access sequence. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly; final line recharges the audio-echo motif with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally strong, but several artifacts cluster: "the weighted breath" appears four times with minor variation, becoming a loop; "shadow-laced peacekeeper" and "courageous anomaly" read as inserted labels rather than earned descriptors; "a thing of sharp edges and bitter weight" in the opening is stock elevated diction. Filter verbs ("felt the familiar pull," "felt cool and smooth") slightly dull immediacy in key beats. The visions are told cleanly, and the final image lands with clarity, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stake. Rhythm varies purposefully: short declarative ("That was it. That was the sound.") punctuates longer lyric passages. Minor deduction: "a presence that scoured the coastline and carried with it a peculiar kind of peace" and "windborne solace that promised nothing but erasure" restate the same content in adjacent beats (paraphrase loop, −0.2). The ice-calving description ("immense, unhurried separation…sighing crackle") is concrete and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density is high: "the question that demanded a better answer than the one his younger self had supplied" economically establishes regret and growth. Minor elevations—"slumbering rows," "honey in the last slant"—fit the voice and moment without purple excess. One brief paraphrase near the vine metaphor ("convinced his care could overcome...It was a fool's errand") could compress further, but does not obscure causality or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the smooth ceramic of his mask cool against his cheek" anchors object, sensation, and character trait). Figurative language is controlled: "loom of sound," "salt in water," "sea of silent, shifting gold" are vivid without stacking. Minor register drift: "offering of staggering mental weight" and "feeling of profound rightness" edge toward abstraction in peak beats but remain legible. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold detected. Clarity and propulsion are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; sentences layer sensory detail with thematic resonance. Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports the accumulative build. Minor issues: "strange, artistic ritual" and "earnest whimsy" feel like authorial intrusions rather than POV-filtered terms. The phrase "the geography of a community's heart" and "quiet testament" edge into stock lyricism. Sentence openings vary and read-aloud ear test passes cleanly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; proofreading is clean. One clarity slip: "Its purpose fulfilled" ambiguously refers to the mosaic rather than the map case, requiring a re-read.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with strong information density. Opening line ("man folded into the shape of a question mark") anchors voice and stakes immediately. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence structures shift between short declaratives and longer accumulations. Minor pattern: slight overreliance on "was" constructions in the middle section ("It was sonically reflective," "It was chaos"), though these don't obscure causality. Figurative language is controlled and apt ("solid tear for a silent age," "mosaic of auditory moments"). No loops or scaffolding; momentum is maintained through the weeks-long listening sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density and propulsion through most beats. Figurative language is generally purposeful ("fog rolling into...corners of his mind," "phantom limb of future knowledge") and controlled. However, elevated metaphor clusters in the climax paragraph risk overwriting: "weary sigh of rusting metal, the slow decay of magnetic tape, the patient erosion of stone" stacks three parallel vehicles where one might suffice, and "boundless, all-encompassing tide" adds modifiers that don't sharpen the image. The final paragraph's dissolution image is clean and earns its resonance. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, syntax varies purposefully. The peak-beat density slightly dulls momentum without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and propulsion is strong through the crisis. Information density is high with minimal scaffolding. Two minor issues prevent higher score: "the luminous ache" recurs identically without variation (start and end), risking template echo. The phrase "his gnarled fingers moving with a grace that belied his age" in the opener carries slight cliché coloring. No loops, clear grammar, and the closing image ("beautiful, silent prison outside of time's grasp") is sharp and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "gravity-spun blanket," "quiet was a living thing," "pulsing stillness that vibrated," "percussive note in her composition of care," "bridge across time," "tangible thread." Several metaphors stack without pattern-teaching or payoff (the room as instrument, the goodbye as hymn, stillness that pulses and vibrates). "Hymning the mundane" names the method but the prose overworks the concept, layering metaphor where concrete action would sharpen. Template cadence appears in the tea-ritual paragraph ("Each soft click... each rustle... each measured beep"). The final paragraph summarizes theme rather than letting the image land unadorned.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high ("interlocking rings and glyphs, a puzzle in itself"). However, mild template cadence appears in the opening beats: "Her motivation, born from...was to find" and "Her method was one of..." recur as parallel stems. The final beat—"It folded inward on itself, retreating into a dimensionally thin crease"—is clear and propulsive. No paraphrase loops or metaphor muddle, and the closure image remains untouched by artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies; opening sensory anchors are strong. Information density is high in the discovery beat. However, patterned scaffold appears: "He had spoken...his voice a balm" / "he had always considered" / "His life's work had been" / "His biggest mistake...was" form repetitive stems across the opening section. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraph two restates his regret about dismissing folklore in slightly varied terms. Figurative density ("cobweb in morning mist," "compound fracture of the soul," "chasm," "cleft") clusters without full pattern-teaching, edging toward overwriting. These artifacts don't obscure closure but dull momentum in the first half. Apply −0.8 for combined scaffold and density issues.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; sentences layer action, memory, and sensory detail without padding. Two patterns lower the score: repetitive sentence stems in paragraph two ("She began… With a wetted… she started") and paragraph four ("It was becoming… Another memory bloomed… Each stroke… The glass was"), creating template cadence (−0.5). Additionally, "reflectively vibrant" (paragraph four) is a strained coinage that muddles the glass's transformation, and the final paragraph's "Here, in her misty solitude, she held a star she could share" edges toward summary rather than trusting the image. No paraphrase loops or major pronoun drift; clarity and propulsion remain strong outside these slips.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and image-rich, with strong specificity ("green velvet of the moss," "drop of solidified honey"). Sentence openings vary and information density is high. Minor overwriting in the opening clause ("honeyed hush...a sound you could feel, a soft weight") where three metaphors jostle without full coherence. One paraphrase loop: "fossilized insect" / "grim prison" within three lines. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; the final image ("fertile ground") recharges prior material cleanly. Deductions for the opening muddle and one redundancy prevent higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high in the opening third, establishing concept and conflict efficiently. However, overwriting clusters in the middle: figurative language appears in most sentences of the cameo parade ("starlight caught in her hair," "mechanical heart that ticked in time with crickets," "catalogued scents") without clear escalation, creating decorative density rather than propulsion. The phrase "swirling hush" recurs three times, a minor loop. Sentence openings vary, but the steady accumulation of spectral descriptions risks rhythmic monotony. No major clarity breaks, but the lushness occasionally obscures the causal spine.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the ritual sequence. Information density is high: most lines advance setting, character focus, or ritual mechanics. Clarity remains intact; spatial choreography and action order track cleanly. However, modest text-pattern debt: "the song was the key, and the attribute of this sacred vine was that it spins golden stories" reads as scaffold explanation rather than dramatized discovery; "weaving through the quiet air" / "weaving through the overhead lattice" recycles the verb within two paragraphs; filter verbs cluster in early beats ("felt the weight," "seemed to vibrate") without voice motivation. No loops touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—each line advances ritual, world, or atmosphere. Clarity is strong overall. Deductions: "fear and waiting" / "fear but promising safety" recycles the fear motif without added pressure. "The orchard, nestled deep" and "deep within a subarctic crater" are near-synonyms within two paragraphs. "Complete, but...not yet finished" is a paraphrase loop. Filter-verb stack in paragraph two: "offered," "began," "was placed," "was the first step"—four passives/weak constructions in close succession dull immediacy. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence, plus −0.1 for filter cluster.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Several prose artifacts dull momentum: "accustomed to seeing how a system's inner workings were mirrored" and "he could perceive the ghost of the machine's operation" use passive filter verbs and abstract nominalizations. "Days bled into weeks under the weight of the wounded season's oppressive calm" stacks decorative modifiers without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in "He saw how…while…was meant to…" The final paragraph's "watching the fragments of stored wonder reawaken" loops the wonder/cellar motif without adding detail, and "They were safe now, preserved in the vault of his reason" is near-paraphrase of the earlier axiom.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and concrete with strong information density ("kerosene lamp burner, its brass body tarnished with age and immense use, its glassless gallery like a waiting crown"). Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports beats. No paraphrase loops or major template cadence. Minor issues: "immense care" / "immense use" near each other; "misery, a frantic, chaotic thing" stacks two near-synonyms; "The world above wept its winter coat" is slightly strained metaphorically (coat-weeping mix). One figurative muddle: "whalebone reverie" is evocative but its vehicle (whalebone) does not map clearly to the tenor (meditative state), reading slightly ornamental. These are hairline slips that do not obscure causality or closure but prevent entry to 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; the kettle's escalation is propelled through concrete action beats. Information density is high: most lines do double duty (e.g., "He was all here and gone" compresses Leo's character and absence). Minor paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "letting the sound...guide her inward" followed by "She would sift through...one perfect, crystalline moment" restates intent. The phrase "hauntingly practical" appears twice in close proximity (title reference and method description), creating template cadence. Figurative language ("like trying to bottle a storm," "ocean of stillness") is coherent and purposeful, but density in the memory beat approaches overwriting without full payoff. Closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Rhythm modulates well (short declaratives at confession: "No." "It was my fault."). Three friction points: "chronological confusion that plagued him" and "temporal bleed" are synonym loops for the same state; "resolute in a world that had surrendered" is elevated diction that clashes with scavenger idiom; the phrase "constant, heavy weight of regret" in paragraph three is told summary of what the scavenging dramatizes. Minimal propulsion loss, but the loops and one filter-verb stack ("believed that if he could just assemble") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong sentence variety and purposeful rhythm. Minor scaffold appears in paired abstractions: "quiet hum of curiosity vibrated through her, a frequency she understood better than words" restates the same idea. The phrase "maze of intentions, a hidden layer of purpose" loops conceptually. Opening metaphor "ghost of a ghost" and "resurrected dreams" lean slightly purple but don't obscure causality. Information density is high in the technical middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (coffer, bells, sanctuary roles all compressed efficiently). Two small artifacts lower the score: "the hush felt different, thrumming with a low-frequency memory" introduces a mixed metaphor (glacial hush thrumming), and "The crushing weight he had carried in his chest for twenty years eased, not gone, but settled, transformed into a quiet, foundational stone" stacks metaphors (weight/stone/architecture) in one clause without full coherence. Otherwise, clarity and momentum hold; no loops or scaffolding. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is high; most lines advance story and atmosphere. The opening image ("water...the color of a day-old bruise") and closing image ("pale, thoughtfully clear line of silver") bookend the piece with purposeful contrast. Minor overwriting appears in stacked modifiers: "profound hindsight clarity," "static hissing from a small battery-powered radio," and the metaphor "shedding mud and dark water like a surfacing leviathan" feels slightly ornate for the tense retrieval beat. Two instances of paraphrase loop: "the architecture of the lie" is restated as "a load-bearing falsehood" within two sentences, and the sundial's paradox is explained twice in the final paragraphs. These accumulate to −0.6 in Q7 and prevent entry into the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but purposeful. However, overwriting clusters appear: "profound oceanic hush" (twice), "the nascent forms of forgotten ideas, the kernels of lost ways," "the liminal hour when the veil between what is and what was grew thin" all in the opening third. Stock elevated register ("alignment with the pace of the world," "sublime partnership") reduces specificity. Paraphrase loop: "The fog began its slow invasion" / "its tendrils ghosting over the water's surface" restates motion without added pressure. Clarity remains high; momentum is steady but slowed by ornamental layers.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent.句子 structure modulates between longer lyric constructions and shorter anchoring beats. Information density is generally high. However, several overwriting patterns cluster in key beats: "the damp, sweet scent of decay, a perfume of rust-colored chrysanthemums" stacks modifiers; "Her absence wasn't an ending; it was a destination she had been weaving for years" is elegant but slightly redundant with prior carpet-as-map establishment; "a quiet testament to a life not lost, but perfectly, finally, navigated" over-explains the thematic resonance already present in the image. The projection paragraph runs long without breath, and "lonesome splendor" appears three times (opening, midpoint, close-to-end) as a thematic tag rather than evolving pressure. Minor template cadence in the vision sequence: "He saw… He felt… He witnessed…" across adjacent lines. No loops that obscure causality, but density could tighten by 8–10%.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. However, the piece contains several stock metaphor and elevated-diction clusters in high-pressure beats: "object of his quaking reverie," "consumed the last vestiges of his royal composure," "testament to its flawed genesis," "bitterly sweet anthem." These phrases feel slightly pre-fabricated rather than urgent, and the phrase "a testimony to its flawed genesis" and "an entirely new, hybridized life" lean on summary-tell at the climax rather than trusting the image alone. Minimal paraphrase loops, but the figurative density in peak moments triggers a moderate deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and the opening/closing images anchor well. The graft sequence is concrete and propulsive. Minor issues: "This was not just a job; it was an inheritance she was determined to rewrite" is expository; "the thing that quieted the ghosts" tells rather than shows. The phrase "unyielding compassion" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment. "Kelp-drift peace" appears twice in identical form without reweighting. One paraphrase loop: "This was her true work, the thing that quieted the ghosts" shortly after "This was not just a job." Deduction: −0.6 for scaffold and label recurrence in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and concision are mostly strong; sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the breadcrumb beats. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "It was not a vision or a spell, but a subtle shift in the world's fabric, a feeling of deep, collective relief" restates the effect already shown by the whisper of water. Filter-verb stacks appear ("she had been following," "she'd identified," "she understood") but remain legible. Figurative language is dense throughout (luminescence, fractured color, kaleidoscope, ghosted forth) without pattern-teaching or clear payoff beyond atmosphere, approaching overwriting in the middle section. Proofread; no significant errors. The final beat is clean, but cumulative scaffold and metaphor density in non-closure beats warrant moderate deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the prose breathes ("This was the burden," "For eons," "One particular echo"). Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or theme. The figurative language is controlled and apt ("stars were born and died in the same breath," "fire that devoured memory"). Minor scaffold: "It was" and "This was" openers recur in paragraphs two and three without pattern-teaching (four instances in ~150 words). The final paragraph's "was" stack (three in five lines) slightly flattens propulsion but does not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and sentence openings show variety. Two paraphrase loops appear: "The thought was so vivid...This was her spectral mentorship" restates guidance across adjacent lines without added pressure; "He was mapping not the stone, but the very emotion...learning her hand, her intent" cycles through similar restatements. The storm paragraph achieves strong propulsion ("His focus narrowed...his chisel followed a path") but the abstract explanation that follows ("It was a network...") slows momentum when image could carry meaning. Minor filter stacking in early paragraphs ("He began," "He closed," "He picked up") without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance ritual, memory, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives at the pause, longer immersive clauses during the vision. Minor scaffold: "The work of absolution was never finished, only continued" and the final "One tick, one inscription, one heartbeat at a time" edge toward abstracting what has been dramatized, though the prior embodied lightness earns the summary. "Profound lightness, not of relief, but of a burden correctly shouldered" carries minor redundancy (lightness/burden restates the same idea). No loops or template cadence; figurative language (salt spray, searing reverie, phantom brine) is coherent and serves the ritual frame. Overall propulsion is smooth with clarity intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid heavy template runs. Information density is high—most lines advance decoding or atmosphere. Minor overwriting in metaphor clusters: "birdsong after a storm," "cherished blanket," "tenderness" in close succession create a slight figurative thicket near closure. One paraphrase loop: "uncharted echoes" recurs in identical phrasing without added pressure. No egregious scaffold or loops elsewhere. The line "a silence that always felt like the chess clock runs down" has a tense hiccup ("runs" should be "running" or "ran"). Propulsion is steady; no momentum stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies well and information density is high; the opening line ("shard of night piercing a sky the color of milk") is vivid and voice-specific. Paragraphs advance pressure without loops. However, paragraph five features a paraphrase cluster: "cascading series…slow thaw…sustained transformation" restate similar content, and "It was a future where his people would have to learn to prevail, not merely endure" tells what was just shown. These artifacts mildly dull momentum mid-piece but do not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally with strong sentence-level propulsion and high information density; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or action. The opening and closing images are vivid and earned. Minor loop detected: "the story famine" and "enforced silence" restate the same contextual fact in close proximity, and "singular, quiet focus" / "deep quiet" echo without added pressure. Figurative language is controlled but approaches density in the final paragraph ("constellations," "internal fire," "ghost made of light," "motes...vessels...whisper") without fully obscuring sense. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Overall craft is strong with minor textural redundancy that does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the ritual beats. "Each mote a tiny star" and "the dying momentum" are precise. Minor issues: "the scent of charcoal dust and old paper clinging to her like a second skin" is a stock metaphor; "a thread in the profound quiet" and "heavy, knowing stone" lean purple. "Somber marvel" and "transcendent peace" border on tell-labeling in the closure paragraph. No loops or template cadence, but figurative language clusters slightly in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively ("Silas knew better, because he was willing to get his hands dirty" versus the longer, layered description of sedimentary strata). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or conflict. One paraphrase loop appears: "his mission felt, at once, profoundly important and utterly, cosmically useless" is then restated as "He was a librarian in a world that had forgotten the alphabet"—both convey futility without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative language is controlled and voice-consistent ("shroud," "barrenness of the soil"). No scaffold or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences do two jobs (e.g., "autumn was performing its slow, magnificent decay" grounds season and tone). Minor scaffold appears: "a familiar, expectantly resigned sigh" front-loads both the attribute and its label; "traveled stillness" in the library echoes the required tone term but feels imposed rather than emergent. One near-loop: "His method had been wrong; he had been trying to add more…" followed immediately by "True harmony…is achieved not by addition, but by subtracting noise" restates the same insight without added pressure. Figurative density is high in the opening paragraph ("performing its slow, magnificent decay," "microcosm," "forged from the bitter remnants") but remains coherent and voice-motivated. No major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clarity and rhythm are strong; sentence variety supports momentum through the pruning sequence. Information density is high: most lines advance action, sensory detail, or thematic weight. Minor template cadence in the pruning beat: "Snip. He tasted… Snip." reads as purposeful refrain rather than artifact. Stock metaphor slips: "skeletal remains," "forgotten era," "soul of his culture" trend generic without fresh particularity. The line "his work had just begun" closes with slight tell rather than pure image. No loops or major scaffold; opening and closing lines anchor well.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with varied syntax. Opening line ("The air at the base…thick and sweet, tasting of ozone") anchors voice and stakes. Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or conflict. Minor loop: "the truth" appears three times in close succession ("That holds the truth," "The truth about the blackout?"). Figurative language ("syrupy, nectar dusk," "heart had stopped") is coherent and voice-motivated, but "drone-bees" and "bio-mechanical life" in the riddle-reveal paragraph edge toward expository summary rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clean with varied sentence structure and strong imagery ("bleeding into the bruised lavender," "sliver of organic chaos"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Minor loop detected: "quiet" recurs across paragraphs without reweighting ("quiet bay," "quiet work," "bay was still quiet"). Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph: "He was holding... turning it over... He hadn't bought it yet, but the thought was there, a crack..." reads as stacked participles without propulsion. One metaphor strain: "hushed blaze" pairs contradictory sensory modes (auditory hush, visual blaze) without resolution. These non-closure artifacts accumulate to −0.7 within band.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: "The secret settled not like dust, but like silt" seeds the burial payoff; "foxglove: beautiful flower, potent heart poison" compresses setup. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates well—short urgent beats during revelation, longer syntax during contemplation. Minor deduction for two adjacent explanatory moves in paragraph four: "This was the city's lung, not its vulnerability. And she was the disease..." The second sentence restates rather than advances; cutting it would tighten without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Opening sentence ("indistinguishable from the one above or the billion below") establishes infinite sameness efficiently. Minor paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "to capture the texture" is restated as "the physical embodiment of the probability he had failed to calculate" without added pressure, costing ~−0.2. Figurative language ("monument to perpetual motion," "ghost") stays coherent. Rhythm varies; no template-cadence runs. The rupture beat's sensory stack (damp chill, rain, lock click, weight of words) packs four jobs into one moment without opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic texture. Information density is high—most lines do double work (character + atmosphere, world + stake). Two minor loops: "The silence that answered was vast and profound. Minutes stretched into an hour" could tighten; "He had to rouse them. One by one, he flicked the switches" repeats intent. Figurative language is dense but coherent (moon "apologetic," brush "drinking" light, symbols "blazed"). No filter stacks, no template cadence. Proofreading is clean. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and resolve through image. The "saffron quiet" metaphor threads beautifully but borders purple in aggregate.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the middle third (bread → memory → proposal → singing). Opening and closing images are vivid. However, several phrases loop or scaffold: "historically oriented" appears three times; "emerald-tinted opera glass lens" is repeated in full twice within close proximity; "displaced" recurs as both noun and implicit theme without variation. "Rosewater dread" and "a beautiful, fragile existence perpetually on the verge of shattering" are poetic but abstract, softening urgency. The singing sequence has clear propulsion, but "faithful audience" and "ragged hope" are stock descriptors. No major muddles, but small synonym churn and template cadence in exposition ("the one treasure he had managed to save," "his old professional habit taking over") accumulate to −0.6 under the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is controlled ("bones of a forgotten leviathan," yoyo as "mechanical mantra"). Information density is high in the opening and assembly sequences. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "He believed causality was not a river but a tangled knot" is followed closely by "with the right tools, one could pull a different thread," restating the same concept. The phrase "latent radiance" and "ghost of potential" recur without added pressure. Stock construction "This was not… it was…" in the opening and "There was no… only…" at the climax are template cadences that slightly dull momentum. No artifacts touch the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("sweetness that coated the back of my throat like a lie," "frantic bird in a cage of bone," "silent symphony") with mixed coherence—moths don't scream, and "cleansing, silent fire" contradicts itself. Template stems recur: "The advisor had called/explained" (×2), "I had to" (×2). Elevated diction pervades peak beats ("repulsive allure," "annihilating focus," "profound sense of permanence"), creating register drift from the funhouse's visceral rot. Information density is strong and sequencing clear, but the decorative load slows momentum. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("repulsive allure of my existence"), triggering the high-band disqualifier.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. However, "blue hour" appears twice (opening and closing) without reweighting, and "restless euphony" in the opening paragraph feels ornamental rather than earned. A few figurative reaches ("canvas," "orchestra," "soloist") stack without strict coherence but remain legible. No loops or scaffold; propulsion is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high (every line advances character, stakes, or world) with minimal scaffold. One paraphrase slip near midpoint ("question the silent watchers" / "seeking answers from them") but does not loop. The climax beat is propulsive and clear, with strong verbs ("coalesced," "shimmering," "crystallizing") and no figurative muddle. Minor filter-verb reliance ("realized," "saw," "believed") in exposition paragraphs slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality or touch closure. No template cadence or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean, with varied sentence lengths and no obvious loops. However, the Ashworth exposition runs for three uninterrupted paragraphs with similar syntactic patterns ("They, too, had...," "It worked...," "But a story built on nothing...," "People felt..."), creating template cadence in the persuasion beat. Figurative language is purposeful (ivy, millstone, gilded cage) but "the weight of unspoken history" and "the canvas for the image he was painting" edge toward stock metaphor. Information density is adequate but momentum sags during the history lecture. The opening petal and the closing vellum frame the piece, yet the middle stretches into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or action. However, several figurative phrases cluster without payoff: "currents of feeling," "skeletal hand reaching from a watery grave," "dark star" in the final paragraph. The phrase "interlaced absence" appears three times without evolving pressure. Minor scaffold appears in the opening: "The world saw... They did not see..." toggles unnecessarily when one frame would suffice. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Clarity and momentum hold, but the density of metaphor in non-peak beats slightly exceeds voice necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most lines advance setting, discovery, or stakes). The opening ("hum...died without a whimper") and closure image ("reclaimed stillness held him") frame the arc cleanly. Clarity and momentum are strong. Minor deductions: "A profound sense of peace washed over" is slightly abstract and could be more embodied; "dappled resolve" in the penultimate paragraph reads as prompt-label echo rather than earned image. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language ("ghost of an impression") remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies well; figurative language ("shadow detaches," "grief…a formless, heavy water," "dust…like powdered starlight") is dense but coherent. Sentence openings vary. Information density is high in the pilgrimage compression. Two line-level issues: "His singular motivation now was a quiet, desperate thing: to fold his grief…yet the sorrow was a formless, heavy water" paraphrases the same idea (formless grief) across adjacent clauses. "The dream was not a tragedy; it was a promise" + "achingly beautiful and forever broken" stacks three abstract emotional summaries in rapid succession without concrete image anchor, dulling peak-beat immediacy. Apply baseline artifact deduction −0.6 in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well ("ticked like a deathwatch beetle," "white-hot shriek," "thump-click") and information density is high. However, several lines loop or restate: "The geode felt warm in her palm, a focusing lens for the grief that fueled her" closely echoes earlier mentions without adding pressure. The bracketed "[intricately tangible" fragment is a generation artifact that obscures sense in the final third. Metaphor density ("veins of a violation," "silent chord," "reservoir") occasionally stacks without clear referents, reducing propulsion in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and sentences carry momentum with strong verbs ("iris-ed open," "shot through"). Information density is high with most lines advancing action or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "an hour after the pilgrim arrives, and now, an hour after he had vanished" restates the same interval, and "missing pieces" is invoked twice in adjacent beats without added pressure. The phrase "a font of pure meaning being written in real-time" uses elevated abstraction that clashes with the prior concrete diction of "whir" and "scraping sound."

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; opening and closing images are strong. Information density is high, each line advancing character or stakes. Minor scaffold detected: "His motivation was singular and sharp" states rather than shows, and "the weight of a withheld truth" recurs without added pressure. "Tempered regret" appears twice in identical phrasing. The figurative density ("bleeding," "sieved," "sandpaper on bone") is vivid but occasionally ornamental without altering tactics. Clarity and propulsion remain solid.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at the exchange, longer syntactic builds in the opener), and information density is high—most lines do double duty (the lion both key and anchor, the moon phases both clock and trust guarantee). Two minor loops: "a chasm far wider than the parapet itself" and "the space between apology and forgiveness" cover similar conceptual ground within three paragraphs; "swallowed" appears twice (sea swallowing lands, mist swallowing sound) without functional variation. The lockbox sequence is clean and propulsive. One elevated phrase—"furrowed hush"—stands out against the operational register but does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; sentences multitask without padding. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the final beats. Clarity is maintained throughout; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Minor penalties: a few figurative clusters in early paragraphs edge toward density without full payoff ("bruised twilight," "stoic, wooden bodies," "vessel beached" within two paragraphs). The phrase "merrily melancholic joke for an audience of one" reads slightly overwrought for the moment's pressure. Loop check: "align heart and action" appears twice in close proximity as both desire and command, which reads as intentional intensification rather than churn. Overall propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is generally strong, but several paraphrase loops appear: "a shadow he couldn't see but felt" / "a ghost he couldn't recognize" restate numbness without added pressure. The metaphor density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching; "ghost," "shadow," "slate," "labyrinth," "spark," "kindle" all operate in quick succession, and "delicately robust" is both a descriptive phrase and a thematic claim without full embodiment. Template cadence emerges in the opening paragraph with repeated "his" stems. The final paragraph's "tiny, fragile spark" and "aching blueprint" edge toward stock phrasing. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, limiting the deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is lyric and controlled with strong rhythmic variation, but figurative density is high throughout: "quiet river," "vast silent ocean," "tangible ghost," "drunk the moonlight" cluster without pattern-teaching or earned payoff. Several lines paraphrase without adding pressure: "This was his magic" followed immediately by "It was the method of his art." The final paragraph stacks filter constructions ("could feel her consciousness") and tells the closure effect ("had become a permanent part") rather than trusting the image to land it. Mixed metaphor: scales "flared with inner light" then become "iridescent plumage that drank the moonlight"—luminous or absorbent?

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is mostly coherent ("undertow of loss," "vapor dissolving into ether"). Information density is high, with most lines advancing interiority or image. However, multiple lines exhibit template cadence and paraphrase loops: "She turned it over and over" adjacent to reflection on the crack; "a testament to the clumsiness" restates "fractured heart" without added pressure; "not as a seeker… but as a creator" repeats the renunciation already shown in the cloak-drop. Stock metaphor strings appear in high-pressure beats ("weeping smudge," "crushing burden," "aching soul"). Apply baseline −0.6 for paraphrase/template artifacts and −0.3 for stock metaphor concentration, totaling approximately −0.9 in-band deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer contemplative sentences in setup and shorter, intensified beats during emotional peaks. Information density is high; nearly every line advances situation, character state, or thematic work. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "theoretical reality hypothesized" and "crystallized compassion," which read slightly elevated for the tactile, embodied voice elsewhere. One paraphrase loop near the end: "She did not breach it with power, but offered it..." echoes the earlier acceptance-over-force framing without adding new pressure. Overall clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, with varied sentence structure and selective sensory detail. However, several lines loop or restate: "vibrant hush" is defined, then immediately glossed as "a silence so full of immense, quiet power it felt louder than a scream"; "orchestrates coincidences by simply following the world's quiet suggestions" paraphrases the frame established in the opening. Figurative language is dense in high-pressure beats ("swirling galaxy of gentle, greenish-gold light," "drink the light in," "conversed in a language of light") without always adding propulsion. Stock phrasing appears: "profound curiosity," "singular motivation," "unwitting servant." No major scaffold or template cadence, but minor loops and elevated diction reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and opening/closing images anchor cleanly. Information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "He was unlocking the cradle of sparks, a dormant, secondary network woven into the fort's very soul" repeats the concept of hidden infrastructure already established. Template cadence surfaces in the final third: "The chief engineer would see… The quartermaster would see… The captain… would see" stacks identical stems across three sentences (−0.5). "Winking hush," "luminous fort," "cradle of sparks" recur as ornamental phrases without evolving pressure. Figurative density ("island of soft, pearlescent light," "ink-black backdrop," "gentle life of their own," "steady heartbeat") clusters in the opening without clear payoff, though it does not obscure causality. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and climax. However, several lines carry overwriting: "the sea slid against the shore in a silent, unending caress" stacks lyricism without advancing pressure; "a thimbleful of night that warped the air around it" layers metaphor on metaphor in a single beat. The phrase "borrowed dawn" recurs without clear evolution. A paraphrase loop appears: "tracing the sacred patterns of the universe" and "map the chaotic grace of the cosmos" restate the same concept adjacently. These accumulate to −0.8 within Q7 under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent, but several phrases approach overwriting: "skull holding a single, stormlit thought" (opening), "cartography of scars" (repeated), "rarefy the past" (used twice), and "storm-kissed wonder" cluster metaphors without always serving propulsion. The paraphrase loop "His vigil was not for a person, but for a moment of clarity; he had come here to understand…" restates intent across two sentences. Template cadence in reflection blocks ("He remembered… They had called… He had only…") flattens rhythm. The closure beat is clean and propulsive. Information density is high elsewhere, but the overwriting in the first half triggers the patterned-artifact penalty (−0.6) and disallows 9+ globally per the tight pack rule.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the fencing sequence; most lines advance action or atmosphere. Minor overwriting: "whirlwind of dignified chaos," "fluid syllogism executed in tempered steel," and "the question of their duel now answered with a map" stack metaphor and abstraction in quick succession, risking coherence. A paraphrase micro-loop appears: "his response had to be diplomatically fierce" closely echoes the prompt attribute without embodied dramatization. No template cadence or scaffolding loops touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse ("The moon," "Silas felt," "He knelt"). Information density is high: the coffee tin compresses backstory (prison library) and present arsenal (folded poems) in one object. Minor overwriting: "luminous fracture against the darkness" in the final beat leans ornamental, and "hushed reverence of the prison library where their friendship first sparked" stacks modifiers. No loops or scaffold; clarity remains intact at closure. Filter verbs ("saw," "felt") appear but fit voice.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most sentences do double work. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, there are minor figurative density issues in the first third: "drops of silvered sorrow," "ocean of slow-drifting vapor," "star-dusted canopies" cluster without pattern-teaching, creating mild overwriting (−0.4). "Strategically creative" reads as summary rather than embodied demonstration. No loops or scaffold, and the crescendo sequence is propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high, and no paraphrase loops appear. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful—"luminous doubt," "sky-plume blossoms frothed"—without overwriting. Clarity remains strong throughout, and the final beat (rain splattering, seed planted) propels without scaffolding. Minor issues: "the collective memory was fraying, its edges thinning like old tapestry" is stock metaphor; "a quiet click of a lock settling into place" is borderline cliché. "Functionally the same thing" operates as strategic telling that compresses the thematic ambiguity efficiently, though some readers may find it slightly meta.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Two frictions: "tides of remembrance" and "color of unspoken apologies" appear in adjacent paragraphs as conceptual restatements (paraphrase loop). Stock phrase "the day of the severance" recurs without adding pressure. The compass-glow beat is vivid, but elevated diction ("vast canvas of cerulean regret") in a peak moment slightly distances rather than sharpens. No grammar or continuity errors; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and often do multiple jobs at once, maintaining momentum while building atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled and apt (the pane as "plastic canvas"; "final, ghostly tapestry") without sliding into purple or mixed metaphor. A few sentences border on explanatory ("This was decay, but it was messy, loud, and emotional"), but they do not significantly blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and generally economical, with metaphors that are apt for glass and light, and most sentences doing multiple jobs (setting, psychology, and theme at once). Rhythm varies well; there are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or template cadences. A few lines verge on the poetic-abstract (“purpose in the pauses,” “drifting resonance”) and could be grounded with one more concrete hook, but they do not materially obscure sense or momentum. Overall line-level craft is clearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, descriptive choices are specific, and most lines do double duty advancing atmosphere and interiority. The color/emotion mapping is handled cleanly without mixed metaphors, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyric density. There is some risk of over-saturation in figurative language, but it largely serves a coherent pattern rather than becoming purple for its own sake. No significant scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic artifacts blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, with good rhythm and high information density, and most images do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is vivid but generally contained, avoiding the kind of metaphor pileup that muddies sense; phrases like “pressure was a physical manifestation of a thousand silent screams” stay clear and apt. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffold, and transitions are smooth. A few lines flirt with purple or repeat emotional content (noise vs. silence) in similar terms, which slightly dulls impact and keeps this below the topmost band.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and structure, metaphors are apt and not overstacked, and nearly every line carries both atmosphere and information. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or clarity issues; momentum is well-maintained for a quiet story. Phrases like “intergenerational support” or “authentic sounds of a community planting its future” veer a touch toward abstraction, but they are sparse. The opening and closing images echo effectively without feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is generally elegant and efficient, with images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., “drowned thing” memory, “rivers of light” in jasmine veins). Sentences vary in rhythm and structure, and there are no significant scaffold loops or figurative muddles that obscure sense. A few lines flirt with purple (“geometry could not explain”) but they don’t stall momentum or cloud the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (world, emotion, concept) without redundancy, and the metaphoric field (time/light/garden/geometry) stays coherent. There is heavy figurative density but it is controlled and pattern-consistent, rarely crossing into muddle. Rhythm varies well, with longer lyric lines contrasted by shorter, punchier statements at peak beats (“He was wrong.”). I see no significant loops or scaffolding that sap momentum, and the closure image is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, often accomplishing setting, mood, and character simultaneously (“a chaotic jumble of keys…a silent symphony of security”). Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and not so thick as to impede clarity; metaphors extend existing images (music, games, chains) rather than clash. Sentence rhythm has good modulation, with little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and action remains easy to follow. A few heightened phrases approach purple but do not materially blunt momentum or obscure cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, and emotional state) without obvious redundancy, and figurative language is mostly fresh and coherent. Images like “skeletal masts of shipwrecks clawing at a sky they could no longer sail” and the “celestial bruise” aurora are vivid yet legible. There is some density of metaphor that edges toward purple at times, but it rarely stalls momentum or confuses action. Tightening one or two heavily modified sentences could further heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, imagery is generally precise, and most lines carry both atmosphere and character insight. There is a mild tendency toward stacked, high-register metaphor in places (“press your ear against destiny’s door,” “luminous disbelief”) that edges toward purple but doesn’t tip into muddle. Information density and momentum are good; there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and vivid but mostly disciplined figurative language (“a web of fine lines like an ancient map,” “a perfect, crystalline prison of grief”). Sentences generally do double duty—advancing action while deepening mood or theme—without obvious scaffolding or loops. A few constructions (“weighty lightness”) flirt with abstraction but are anchored by surrounding specifics and do not muddy closure. Line-level control would be competitive in high-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally lean, vivid, and purposeful, with strong sentence-level rhythm (“When a wire snaps, you adapt. When your entire identity evaporates, you do the same.”) and good integration of action, thought, and image. Information density is high—most lines advance multiple layers (world, character, stakes)—and there is minimal scaffolding or redundant phrasing. Some metaphors and formulations (“earthquake in my soul,” “my whole body trembled, not with fear, but with…certainty”) are more familiar and slightly purple compared to the rest, and thematic restatement in the closing lines verges on over-telling. These are minor slips rather than structural problems and do not significantly impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is generally excellent: high information density, vivid metaphors (“sound like ice cracking on a winter pond,” “final diamond stud in a vast, dimming velvet”), and strong syntactic variety. Figurative language is frequent but, for the most part, coherent and purposeful, building a consistent textural atmosphere rather than purple noise. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence advances character, concept, or mood. A few phrases (“ambered hush,” “mildly obsessed”) verge on self-conscious, but they don’t materially blunt clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean, varied, and purposeful; most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus interiority). Phrases like “a memory given form, a thought frozen into reality” are vivid without tipping into purple, and repetition around the loops is functional, not redundant. There is some mild explanatory density in the final paragraph that veers toward telling, but it doesn’t significantly slow momentum or blur the closure image. No major artifacts, scaffolding, or metaphor muddles interfere with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with vivid but mostly disciplined imagery (“ship sailing on a sea of clock faces,” “spiderweb light”). Line-level clarity remains high; metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned rather than piled on indiscriminately. There are no obvious paraphrase loops or structural scaffolds dragging momentum, even though the piece is reflective. The only constraint on an even higher score is a slight density of figurative language in early paragraphs that borders on luxuriant, though it never quite tips into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, vivid, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences do double duty for image and theme. Metaphors like the cracked marbles as resilience markers and his face as “blooming, withering grace” are clear and thematically integrated rather than overwrought. Rhythm varies nicely, and there are no major clarity lapses or figurative muddles that blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, metaphors are generally apt, and description does double-duty advancing mood and world. Information density is high without feeling cluttered, and crucial beats (lever pull, hologram’s shift, Elias’s realization) land with clarity. A few lines verge on conceptual repetition or stacked abstraction, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or blur sense. The final paragraph in particular is clean, precise, and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, syntax is controlled, and most images do more than one job (atmosphere, theme, and character all at once). The figurative density is high but rarely purple; metaphors like the hall as a “dark mirror” or the program softened to “old linen” are clear and apt. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and the narrative flows cleanly from one beat to the next. The piece stops short of breathtaking innovation in phrasing, but it easily meets elite-publication competence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with varied rhythm and high information density: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and characterization. Metaphors (auroral sorrow, indigestible stone, swallowed truth) are coherent and thematically aligned, not randomly ornate, and there is no obvious paraphrase looping. The line-level occasionally approaches the lyrical saturation point, but it stops short of purple; clarity and momentum are preserved, especially around the closure beat. Grammar and sequencing are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are purposeful, often doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent; images like “sleeping iron beasts” and “a thin thread in the oppressive quiet” sharpen rather than blur. Prose propels the scene—no dead paragraphs or confusing syntax—through to a clean, resonant ending image. The only restraint from an outright 9+ is that the density of imagery occasionally skirts on the lush side for a high-pressure beat, though it never truly muddies clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally precise, multi-functional, and rhythmically varied, with few redundancies. Imagery (“liquid starlight,” “ink bleeding into water,” “bioluminescent fungi in the deeper vaults”) is vivid and largely coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. There is a mild tendency toward purple density, but it rarely obscures clarity or momentum. The opening and closing lines are particularly effective in framing dust/noise versus obsidian/silence as the story’s textural arc.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished, with strong image choices (the curl as a “perfect comma of spun gold,” the sky as “bruised twilight”) and generally efficient sentences that carry multiple functions at once. There is some density of metaphor and elevated phrasing, but it mostly feels purposeful rather than purple, and clarity remains intact throughout. A few thematic formulations repeat (wonder, magic, linking love and loss), nudging toward slight over-articulation in places. Line-level craft is strong and publication-ready, if not quite at the razor-honed minimalism of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, compressed, and generally do more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, and there are no evident synonym loops or scaffolding artifacts. Moments like “a vocation that had led him to this reclaimed silo library” and “an archivist of the ache” are both economical and evocative. A few abstractions (“fundamental human power”) are slightly less vivid than the surrounding prose, but they do not materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often accomplishing atmosphere, characterization, and forward motion in the same line. Figurative language (music, tides, navigation) is thematically unified rather than ornamental, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences. A few phrases risk mild overrichness, but clarity and momentum remain intact even in reflective passages. The final line lands cleanly as both image and thematic seal.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lean yet lyrical, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and action; the sound-loop description and the handling of silence are particularly effective. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to blur clarity, and there is little to no synonym churn or scaffold. Rhythm varies appropriately between long, layered sentences and clipped questions at points of pressure. A couple of phrases verge on over-crafted, but they don’t materially slow momentum or muddy beats.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world, mood, character) with little scaffolding or redundancy, and the imagery is coherent and sensorially grounded. The prose mostly avoids loops and template cadences, and there are no clarity-breaking artifacts. There is mild overrichness—metaphors and abstractions are frequent enough that some moments (“conductor of unheard symphonies,” “opening chord of reality”) edge toward purple—but they stay intelligible and thematically aligned. A touch more austerity at peak beats would sharpen impact and push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid imagery and multi-tasking sentences that carry both worldbuilding and emotional charge. At times, the language drifts toward abstraction and “concept-stack” (“darkening brightness,” “periodically eternal,” “labyrinth of self”) that risks purple tone and slightly blurs immediacy. Nonetheless, syntax stays clear, and there is little genuine redundancy or scaffolding; information flows smoothly toward the climax. A modest trimming of modifiers and conceptual metaphors, especially in peak beats, would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences advance character, concept, and atmosphere at once. Figurative language (“tapestry woven from vibrations,” “war waged against the gray fog of emotional numbness”) is mostly apt and not overstacked, and rhythm varies well across long, sinuous lines and shorter emphatic ones. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the closure image lands cleanly without figurative muddle. A few abstractions (“their own private numbnesses”) are slightly generic compared to the strongest lines, but they don’t significantly blunt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, economical, and usually do multiple jobs (advancing mood, characterization, and premise at once). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with images like “whetstone” and “a map for someone who could read the language of air” deepening rather than cluttering. There’s no evident scaffolding, synonym churn, or confusing metaphor stacks, and rhythm tracks the scene’s gentle rise in tension. It’s polished enough for serious venues, though an editor might still trim a stray adjective or two for even tighter momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and multi-functional—images like “library of lost fragrances” and “birth that was also an echo” carry atmosphere, theme, and situation at once. Sentence rhythm varies well, and information density is high without major redundancy or scaffolding. There is some flirtation with purple prose and stacked metaphor, especially early on, but it doesn’t obscure meaning or the closure image. A slight trim of modifiers and figurative flourishes in high-pressure beats would elevate the work to top-tier line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for mood and theme. Occasional elevated metaphors (“a cool, earthen womb,” “map of consciousness flowing”) are apt rather than overwrought, and there’s little redundancy. Prose remains clear even in more abstract passages, so momentum is not significantly harmed by lyricism. I see no major loops, syntactic monotony, or figurative muddle touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and cadence, images are mostly clean and non-redundant, and information density is high without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language appears often but is largely coherent and apt, and it typically performs double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus setting). There are no notable paraphrase loops, mixed metaphors, or clarity issues, and the final line crisply resolves prior motifs. At times the descriptive density could be trimmed for even sharper momentum, but it does not significantly drag.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and economical despite its lyricism; most sentences perform multiple functions—worldbuilding, mood, and character—all at once. Figurative language is vivid yet coherent, with the static-electricity conceit extending consistently through emotional beats. There is little to no scaffolding or synonym looping, and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. The density of imagery is high but remains controlled, never quite tipping into muddle or purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding; images like “sea breeze a cool balm” and “voice soft as sea mist” are apt without tipping into purple excess. Sentences tend to do double duty, blending atmosphere with characterization efficiently. Figurative language is present but controlled, and syntax stays clear at emotional peaks, so momentum holds. Minor sentimental coloring at the end doesn’t blur meaning or structure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, with high information density—most lines carry worldbuilding, mood, and characterization simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and coherent with the luminous, crystalline motif; it rarely feels mixed or gratuitous. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or template cadences, and the final paragraph delivers a clear, charged image without getting bogged down. A couple of repeated abstractions (“luminescent ache,” “weave”) flirt with mild purple prose but remain thematically purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and plot) with relatively little redundancy, and figurative language is evocative yet coherent (“frost flowers blooming in seconds,” “cathedral-like structure of crystallized time”). Rhythm varies and avoids obvious template cadences, and there are no major clarity slips or overwrought metaphor stacks. A few phrases verge on abstraction (“dissonant energy,” “temporal lattice”) but remain legible in context and do not dull the closure image. Overall, the prose reads polished and publication-ready, if not formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and multi-tasking lines that advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language (e.g., the lattice, the orchard as a nurtured grief-space) is coherent and not overstacked, avoiding the muddle or repetition common in more purple prose. There are minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and the final sentence efficiently recharges earlier motifs. A few phrases (“mathematics of emotion,” “complex algorithm of his sorrow”) border on conceptual repetition, but they don’t materially slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is high-density and image-rich, yet for the most part avoids redundancy or figurative muddle; sentences typically do double duty for mood and information. Phrases like “sapphire hush,” “a dark offering on a silver altar,” and “a faint, magnetic ghost” are precise and evocative rather than generic purple. There’s some sustained lyricism, but it doesn’t significantly slow momentum or obscure causality, and scaffolding or synonym loops are minimal. The main limiter is that nearly every line reaches for a metaphor or heightened phrasing, which edges close to over-richness at times in such a short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with images doing multiple jobs (e.g., the trellis as both literal structure and life-analogue). Figurative language is generally precise and grounded in the material world, avoiding purple excess. There are a few slightly abstract or expository phrases (“the tone of his world was shifting”) that could be rendered more concretely, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure the closure image. No notable loops or scaffolding artifacts appear.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and structure, images are generally fresh, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character). There’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and the rhythm supports the quiet, accumulative pressure. Metaphors are largely coherent and well-chosen, with only a hint of familiar phrasing in the final “ache of a soul stretched” note. The prose is polished enough for a high-tier venue and needs only light refinement rather than structural line edits.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions at once (world-building, mood, and character) and avoid obvious loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly clean and legible, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. A few lines lean into abstraction or slightly purple phrasing (“immense, ancient desire,” “bright darkness”) that could be sharpened with more concrete work, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure beat. Overall, line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with information, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Sentences like “He navigated absences daily, charting the ghosts of ships by the patterns of barnacles…” are vivid without collapsing into muddle. There is some lushness, but figurative language remains coherent and purposeful, and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or filler lines. Line-level craft supports momentum and mood rather than drawing attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information (“the hour that divides bad habits and new starts,” “cathedral of space and revelation”). Figurative language is generally coherent and not overstacked; there’s little redundancy or scaffold, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. A few phrases verge on purple or abstract (“core concept of his life’s work”), but they don’t obscure sense or dull the closure. Line-level craft is a net asset and close to top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences are generally lean, vivid, and purposeful, often doing double duty for setting, emotion, and theme (e.g., “He was cataloging ghosts for a woman who was now a ghost herself”). Rhythm varies well between longer, wind-and-sea descriptions and tighter, high-pressure moments during the storm. There are a few near-cliché turns (“washed from him,” “simple, profound acceptance”) and mildly purple edges, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or blur meaning. Information density and clarity are high, with no serious scaffolding or looping.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: rhythmic variation, precise word choice, and high information density with few obvious scaffolding lines or redundancies. The figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful; images like light bending at ninety degrees and “a hole in the concept of ‘somewhere’” sharpen rather than blur. A few metaphors (“galaxies bloom and wither like celestial flowers,” “tantrum of a nearby star”) skate close to familiar cosmic-poetic territory, but they don’t materially dull the climax. Overall momentum is well-maintained for a largely descriptive, contemplative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and thematically pointed, and the prose rarely feels purple despite its lyric tilt. Transitions are efficient, with no major redundancy, and the final image is crisp and intelligible. The stylistic richness may slightly outpace the immediacy of tension in spots, but it never obscures causality or meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant, dense, and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and interiority. Phrases such as “a miniature world of immense patience and sculpted life” and “the ghost of an aquatic spectacle breaking against the shore of the present” are vivid without usually tipping into muddle. There is some risk of ornamental phrasing and metaphor stacking, but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or drag momentum at this length. Overall, line-level craft is strong enough for high-end venues, though a ruthless edit could trim a bit of lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but purposefully so, with most sentences doing double duty for setting, emotion, and theme; figurative language (“air in my lungs” vs. “ink that declared me gone”) is generally precise and controlled. There are no obvious scaffold loops or synonym churn, and the narrative flows smoothly from image to image without obscuring sense or causality. At times the metaphorical layering approaches the edge of lushness, but it remains coherent and aligned with the narrator’s sensory-obsessive project. The closing paragraphs, in particular, balance clarity and lyricism in a way that sustains momentum rather than stalling it.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and generally high information density—most lines do double duty in atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but not so thick as to become purple, and metaphors tend to cohere around sound, text, and dust rather than scattering. I see no obvious synonym loops or filler scaffolding; each paragraph advances the experiment or reweights its meaning. A few phrases are familiar (“heart hammered against his ribs”), but they don’t materially dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and image-rich without tipping into incoherent purple; sentences generally do double duty for atmosphere and characterization. There are a few dense descriptive clusters, but they remain clear and forward-moving rather than repetitive or static. No significant scaffolding, synonym loops, or template cadences undercut momentum, and action ordering is crisp. The final paragraph is concise, thematically loaded, and avoids explanatory bloat while tying back to earlier images.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, with varied sentence rhythms and strong sensory specificity; most lines carry multiple jobs (world, mood, and character) without scaffolding. Occasional adjective stacking and slightly purple constructions (“deep and purposefully curious ache,” “onslaught of light”) flirt with overwriting but don’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. There are no obvious loops, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks muddying key beats. It’s polished and fluid, though it could be tightened a touch to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is tight: sentences are varied and musical, imagery is largely clear, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language (“a jewel waiting for its fire to be rekindled,” “decode feedback into direction”) is evocative without becoming purple or incoherent. Information density is high, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and function, and the final paragraph lands with a clean, focused image. A few modifiers and slightly ornate phrasings could be pared for even greater sharpness, but they don’t appreciably slow momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clean, mostly free of redundancy, and images like “a worrying tranquility captured in ice” and “water-veins show their heart on glass” are precise and evocative. Information density is high without feeling overstuffed, and the prose largely avoids cliché; metaphor choices are coherent with the watery/cartographic motif. There are occasional slight over-lush moments and stacked descriptors (“ancient, featureless bedrock,” “tiny capillaries… crystalline arteries”) that verge on purple but don’t obscure clarity. Trimming a handful of modifiers and a repeated “impossibly” would sharpen an already strong surface.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level writing is clean, with varied sentence structures and strong sensory-conceptual density; most sentences do more than one job. There is some risk of purple prose and repeated constructions (“infinitely patient,” “wild hush”), but it stops short of true bloat, and clarity is never lost. No significant scaffolding, synonym loops, or template cadences drag momentum. The main ceiling is that the prose, though attractive, doesn’t quite achieve the startling precision or compression of top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, dense yet purposeful imagery, and very little redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language (“frantic digital heartbeat,” “gathered hush,” “wisp of silent light”) is original and largely coherent with the world’s logic. The prose supports momentum—especially around the vial opening and memory storm—without collapsing into abstraction. Occasional stacked intensifiers and lush descriptions border on overgrown, but they don’t obscure sense or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but largely precise, with most sentences carrying multiple loads (setting, mood, and theme) without collapsing into muddle. Metaphors are generally coherent and original, and repetition is purposeful rather than scaffolding; there’s little to no synonym churn or paraphrase looping. Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous descriptions and tighter, declarative lines at key turns (“They hover.”). A few phrases flirt with purple, but they don’t obscure sense or closure, keeping the line-level craft solidly publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences generally carry multiple functions (image, mood, and plot) and the rhythm varies enough to avoid mechanical cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and thematically apt, and there are few, if any, true scaffold or paraphrase loops. A handful of phrases (“tapestry of endless night,” “pearlescent bud,” “shimmering pollen”) edge toward familiar fantasy diction and could be sharpened or pared back. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved through the climax, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush but largely controlled, with strong information density—many sentences carry setting, mood, and character in one stroke (“a small, copper storybook illustration plate…captured sky vanished into the parched earth”). Rhythm varies and most imagery is coherent and purposeful. There is mild risk of purple prose or metaphor stacking (“orchid solace,” “bone-white memories,” “hauntingly optimistic spirit”), but it rarely muddies sense or repeats content. In the climactic storm sequence, a touch more syntactic compression and concrete physicality could sharpen urgency and keep the lyric register from slightly diluting momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences are well-shaped, varied in length, and usually do multiple jobs at once (advancing setting, theme, and emotion together). Figurative language is rich but largely disciplined, with images (“silver vein slithering over the bleached-white clavicle”) that are concrete and legible rather than mixed or overwrought. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffold; exposition is compact and supports momentum rather than stalling it. A slight density of modifiers in places keeps it just shy of total sharpness, but it never obscures sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and carry multiple functions (world-building, theme, and action) without much slack. Some metaphors and abstractions (“quiet hum beneath his skin,” “weave a lifeline using the discarded threads of the past”) edge toward purple, but they remain coherent and on-theme. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the prose maintains momentum despite the reflective tone.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density; most lines do double duty for setting, character, and stakes. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to become purple, and metaphors remain within a consistent textile/astronomy register. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and action order is always clear, including the technical sequence of the transmission. A very slight tendency toward abstract phrasing (“story of treason plotted just before the coup”) rather than concrete embodiment keeps it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, purposeful, and often do double duty for atmosphere and psychology. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, with no mixed metaphors or opaque images that blur sense. There’s little to no scaffolding, synonym churn, or redundant looping; momentum is maintained without feeling rushed. The prose is lush but never quite tips into self-indulgent purple, making it publication-ready at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong cadence and high information density; images like “twilight bled into a deep violet” and “a dense, physical knot of memory” feel apt rather than overblown. Figurative language is present but not stacked to the point of purple; most sentences do at least two jobs (setting, emotion, theme) cleanly. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolds, or clarity issues, and the final sentence lands with a clear, charged image. A few elevated phrases brush close to lushness, but they remain coherent and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied structures, clean progression of ideas, and dense but purposeful figurative language. Metaphors (fog reclaiming colors, memory as light-saturated negative) are coherent and reinforce the central conceit rather than competing. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances atmosphere or emotional state. The prose is lush but not purple, maintaining clarity even in its most lyrical stretches.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is polished: sentences carry multiple functions, rhythm varies, and metaphors (“waterfall of light,” sound “absorbed by his bones”) are apt and not over-stacked. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and information density stays high without turning purple. A few lines risk mild lyrical overabundance, but they don’t obscure clarity or flatten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, information density is high, and most images do more than one job (worldbuilding plus mood plus theme). Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to become purple or muddled, and metaphors are internally coherent. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops; the prose moves forward with clear cause-effect even in its densest moments. Some intensifiers (“a brewing storm of converging chaos”) verge on redundancy, but they are outliers rather than a pattern that drags momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and musical, with high information density—most sentences advance character, world, and theme simultaneously. Metaphors are generally apt and on-theme, and repetition (e.g., of the postcard, lullabies, wind) reads as purposeful patterning rather than scaffolding. There is a touch of purple density—occasional stacked abstractions and ornate phrasing—that slightly blurs sharpness and could be trimmed for even more impact. Nonetheless, clarity at closure is never in doubt, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight despite its lushness, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and function, and rhythm that modulates well through the scene. Phrases like “foxglove regret of saving the memory but not the life” and “beautiful, toxic sadness” flirt with purple but still carry clear emotional payloads. There are no significant loops or scaffolding, and syntax remains varied and controlled. A touch more restraint in metaphor density at peak beats could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, dense, and purposeful: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language (“symphonies of truth,” “dust motes danced like constellations”) is vivid and coherent, though the overall texture occasionally edges toward ornate. There are no noticeable scaffold phrases, synonym loops, or rhythm templates that dull momentum, and grammar and sequencing are clean. The final lines land with a clear, charged image rather than explanatory summary.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clear, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is largely clean and apt, and there’s very little scaffolding or repetition; prose flows without snagging. Occasional clichés (“so profound it ached”) and a couple of slightly ornamental modifiers are the main minor dings. Overall, the language supports momentum and mood rather than calling attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with economical yet evocative sentences that carry multiple jobs (setting, character, theme) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language—dust as a universe, grief as withering, storm as bruise—stays coherent and appropriately limited, avoiding metaphor pileups. Momentum holds even through reflective passages, and syntax varies enough to keep the ear engaged. I see no major scaffolding, loops, or clarity issues that would impede publication.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and mostly economical despite its lyric density; images like “the sound of light breaking against crystal” and “a weather system of fractured realities” are striking yet clear. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled, and sentences generally do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, and theme) at once. There is some tendency toward abstraction and repetition of conceptual terms (“threshold,” “sacred,” “necessary distances”) that slightly slows momentum. No serious scaffolding or syntactic artifacts mar the closure beat, which lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and generally economical, with several strong images (“meadow of stars,” “shadowseam wonder”) carrying multiple layers of work. Line-level rhythm is varied and clear, and exposition is folded in smoothly. There are a few familiar turns of phrase (“breath they hadn't realized they were holding,” the direct moralizing sentence on belonging) and some stacked modifiers that approach purple but don’t fully tip over. Overall, information density is good and momentum holds, with only minor lapses into cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and often pull double duty in building both world and mood. Figurative language (“cheerful gloom,” “emotional echo roared to life”) is generally apt and not so dense as to blur sense. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; each paragraph moves the story forward. The only limiting factor for top-tier is that the prose, while elegant, rarely takes formally surprising risks that intensify pressure at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, lean toward high information density, and often do double duty (mechanics and mood together). Metaphors are generally clean and apt (“a sound like wind chimes,” “a ghost of creativity”), and there’s little to no paraphrase looping or scaffolding clutter. A few spots stack figurative language (“orchestrated serendipity, a collision of physics and poetry”) in a way that edges toward over-richness, but clarity and momentum are never lost. The final cadence is particularly well controlled, landing on a precise, satisfying image.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and generally avoid redundancy while sustaining a clear forward pulse. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, with images like the dust speck as “a universe of forbidden history” doing multiple jobs at once. Some metaphors (“sudden, immense weightlessness that was also a profound weight”) flirt with overpacked paradox, yet they do not significantly obscure meaning or closure. There’s minimal scaffolding or looped phrasing, and grammar and sequencing are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and musical, with high information density and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but thematically controlled—light, geometry, water, reflection—so it reads as deliberate patterning rather than purple drift. The rhythm slows appropriately at the pond and then opens into a more expansive cadence for the final visual climax. A few abstract phrases (“fundamental grammar of the world,” “cathedral of wonder”) flirt with generality, but they’re grounded by surrounding concrete images and don’t materially blur the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences do multiple jobs, rhythm varies, and imagery is concrete and evocative. There’s some purple edging (“the sound of a house screaming as it died,” “translate pain into a universal language”) and dense metaphor, but it mostly enhances rather than obscures. Information moves forward without loops or scaffolding, and the final paragraph lands cleanly. Tightening two or three of the more overtly figurative or abstract lines would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and efficient: most lines do double duty, advancing action while sustaining atmosphere, with minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and images tend to be coherent and on-theme (fractals, equations, light, tide), avoiding mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies nicely between long, lyrical sentences and shorter, tension-bearing ones, particularly during the gauge’s movement. A slight tendency toward density and abstraction in a few phrases keeps it just shy of truly exceptional line-level work, but there are no major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that usually do double duty for atmosphere and meaning. Descriptive density is high but not so lush as to obscure sense or stall momentum. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding sentences, or figurative muddles in key beats, and the final line lands cleanly. A few metaphors echo familiar patterns (“a key… unlocked the wrong door”) but they are contextually apt.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean despite their lyricism, and description usually carries multiple jobs (mood, worldbuilding, mechanics) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is present but not so dense that it muddies sense, and the closure image is clear and effective. There are occasional slightly purple turns (“a thousand liquid rainbows,” “pulse of pure potential”) that lean conventional. Nonetheless, the prose reads smooth, intentional, and publication-ready with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory images (“vellum…a wound against the dark wood,” “midsummer air thick with the scent of night-blooming jasmine and decay”). Sentence variety and paragraphing maintain momentum without clogging the scene. There is a mild tendency toward density of metaphor, but it stops short of obscuring clarity or feeling purple at closure. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious padding, and rhythm varies effectively. Metaphors are generally fresh and coherent (“mineral ghost of the ocean,” “library of song…unwritten”) and rarely feel mixed. There’s minor figurative density and a few abstracted phrases that could be trimmed, but they don’t obscure sense or dull the closure beat. No significant loops, scaffolding, or copy errors drag the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for image and emotion (“a ghost in white silk against the falling snow”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, and there are few if any outright loops or scaffolding artifacts. That said, the concentration of metaphors and abstractions in some passages could be pared for sharper impact in an elite market. Overall, the line-level craft is strong but not yet flawless under this standard.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight and high-density, with most sentences doing double duty for character, atmosphere, and theme. Metaphoric language is frequent but not so stacked as to blur clarity, and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or filler scaffolds. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep momentum through a reflective piece. A light trim of decorative phrasing in one or two spots could sharpen impact, but nothing significantly dulls the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density—many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and characterization. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding lines. In a few places the accumulation of modifiers (“cradle of impossible green,” “filigree of dust and light,” “blushing stillness”) flirts with purple density, which slightly dulls propulsion. Still, line-level craft is well above average and never harms clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and action at once), and maintain clarity throughout. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and specific, with few redundancies or mixed metaphors; the rope, light, and ice motifs are well handled. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and transitions between beats are smooth. It borders on lush at times, but never to the point of obscuring sense or dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is tight and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for image and concept, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Rhythm varies well between longer, image-rich lines and shorter, urgent ones as the storm hits, maintaining momentum. While the figurative language is frequent and occasionally lush, it remains coherent and supports clarity instead of obscuring it. A hair more spareness at peak-pressure beats could accentuate impact, but this is already high-level line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and largely effective figurative language (e.g., the palace as “a tomb awaiting a new corpse,” the universe “breathing in”). There’s minimal redundancy, and line-level clarity remains intact even where metaphors are layered. At times the diction skirts the edge of purple (“gossamer structure of iridescent gas and nascent light”), but it remains coherent and controlled, not muddling action or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are generally tight, clear, and purposeful, with strong information density and few redundancies. Figurative language (“a universe suffering a fever,” “resentment so ancient it had become a law of physics”) is apt and memorable, though the prose sometimes hovers at a high level of abstraction. There is occasional risk of purple-leaning conceptual phrasing, but it rarely muddies causality or action. Line-level craft is solidly publishable, if not yet razor-honed in varying texture and concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level writing is polished and economical for a lyric piece: most sentences do double duty for image and meaning, and the metaphors (“soft, grey wall,” “petrified stump,” “lattice of frozen breath”) are coherent and grounded. Syntax and paragraphing create a smooth cadence that slows for meditation and tightens around the appearance and loss of the glass mountains. While the prose rides close to the edge of lushness, it largely avoids redundancy or metaphor pile-ups that would obscure sense. I see no significant scaffolding, loops, or technical slips that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, dense, and purposeful: sentences often do two or three jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without feeling padded. Imagery like “a second, living architecture” and “a beautiful scar” is vivid but controlled, and there’s little sign of synonym loops or scaffolding. Rhythm modulates appropriately from descriptive to climactic beats. A couple of abstract phrases (“A wave of accidental wisdom washed over him”) are slightly tell-y, but they don’t meaningfully dull momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and characterization, and the metaphors (e.g., “headache that felt like trying to remember the future”) are apt and memorable. There is some density of figurative language—occasionally bordering on lush—but it remains legible and purposeful rather than muddled. Redundancy is minimal, and syntax varies enough to sustain momentum in a mostly contemplative piece. A tiny refinement in trimming a few ornamental modifiers would heighten impact and clarity further.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character). Metaphors like “smoke made of scripture” and “Rosetta Stone of petal and stem” are vivid without becoming muddled, and there’s little in the way of scaffold or synonym loops. Some lines stack abstractions (“future crumbling under the weight of its own unlearned history”) and could be trimmed for sharpness, and the density of metaphor is occasionally near the upper edge of comfort. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publication-ready, if a touch lush in spots.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and economical for its lyric density, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors are largely coherent and on-theme (sea, fog, gardens, threads, watercolor), and there is little in the way of scaffold, synonym loops, or filler. Rhythm varies gracefully between longer, meditative lines and shorter, sharper beats around the climax (“The feeling receded, leaving an echoing void in its wake. Elara gasped…”). A few abstract phrases (“narrative sensation,” “unique biology”) slightly flatten immediacy, but they don’t seriously impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong throughout: varied syntax, high information density, and images that usually pull double-duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding (“a chord played on an instrument that had yet to be invented”). There is occasional ornate phrasing, but it remains coherent and purposeful rather than purple; few, if any, lines feel like redundant scaffold. The prose sustains momentum even through explanatory steps, and the final paragraph lands cleanly without exposition bloat. This is close to elite-line work, with only minimal risk of stylistic over-saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished, with high information density and purposeful figurative language (“noise that had angles and edges,” “symphony of terrestrial whispers”). Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and most images do double duty for atmosphere and concept. There is some risk of purple prose and metaphor stacking, but it rarely impedes clarity or momentum. The climax and closing paragraphs remain crisp and readable despite the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with high information density; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character or theme. Figurative language (e.g., “bruised twilight,” “library of whispers”) is consistent in image-family and rarely feels excessive or mixed. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or template cadences that drag momentum, and grammar/syntax are clean. A few lines verge on the overtly aphoristic, but they don’t materially blur clarity or undercut the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, largely concise, and information-dense, with many sentences doing triple duty (worldbuilding, mood, and character). Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt; moments like “a scar tissue formed over a communal wound” and “preemptively nostalgic” are striking without obscuring clarity. There is mild risk of purple density in places, yet it rarely stalls momentum or muddles the closure image. I see no significant loops, syntactic monotony, or technical errors that interfere with reading.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and controlled, with high information density: most sentences carry atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern-consistent (void, silence, bloom, patterned knots), avoiding mixed metaphors. There are minor tendencies toward lushness and repeated structures, yet they rarely stall momentum or blur sense. The final lines in particular are clean and strong, giving a clear, charged closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong information density—most sentences do double duty for image and theme. Imagery is generally coherent and purposeful (e.g., “miniature, violent ballets of tidal pools,” the cicada’s life cycle) and rarely feels strained. There is some risk of purple excess and conceptual repetition around “transition” and time, but it doesn’t seriously impede clarity or momentum at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“a promise of something more delicate than reinforced steel”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, with only a few phrases edging toward purple or redundancy (“a silence so perfect and polished it felt like a weight” plus similar later weights). There are no major loops, syntactic artifacts, or clarity issues, and the final paragraph lands cleanly. Slight pruning of metaphor density in the early paragraphs would increase propulsion without sacrificing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and often doing multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, atmosphere, and emotional state) with lines like “He was teaching her the architecture of the hush, its pillars and its arches.” Figurative language is sustained and coherent around silence, architecture, and transit; it rarely tips into purple or redundancy. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding phrases, and sentence-level clarity and momentum remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally multi-tasking (worldbuilding, mood, and plot often carried together). Figurative language is imaginative and usually coherent with the world’s logic, and there’s little scaffolding or redundant explanation. There is some purple lean—multiple vivid metaphors per paragraph in places—which slightly blurs urgency and could be pruned for even sharper momentum under the ticking clock. Nonetheless, clarity at the climax and in the closure image remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense but generally sharp, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and information, and metaphors (bridge-burning as cauterization, scars as conduits) that are internally consistent. There is little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping; progression feels clean on a line level, and the closure image is clear and undimmed by figurative clutter. At times, stacked abstractions (“tender shadow keeper,” “self-imposed prison,” “tapestry of their shared pain”) verge on purple, briefly risking over-ornament. Still, these moments do not materially obscure cause/effect or momentum, keeping the line work solidly in the publishable range.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally lean yet lush, packing multiple functions into single sentences (world-building, mood, and character all at once) with good rhythmic variation. Metaphors (“like walking into the heart of a star,” “as if down a drain”) are clear, apt, and not over-stacked, so high-pressure beats stay readable. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line advances atmosphere or stakes. A few abstract phrases (“pure, destructive chaos,” “universe handed to her on a silver platter”) are more generic than the strongest images, but they don’t materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. The figurative language is frequent and sometimes ornate, pushing toward purple but rarely into outright muddle; most images are legible and thematically apt. There are no major syntactic artifacts or clarity issues, and the final lines land crisply. A slight over-saturation of metaphors in some passages keeps this from the very top tier but it is clearly publishable prose.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density—most lines carry both image and function. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise (equations in sap, glass panes panicking, air stretching and snapping) and supports atmosphere without collapsing into muddle. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; momentum through the crisis is well maintained. The one risk is mild purple-prose density, but it doesn’t seriously obscure clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, theme) without padding, and rhythm varies to suit the contemplative mode. Figurative language is vivid but not overstacked; phrases like “its cold weight a solid piece of a life otherwise rendered into script” are both clear and impactful. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony, and grammar/punctuation are clean. The only constraint on a higher score is that a few phrases lean toward familiar emotional shorthand (“her own broken heart ache with sympathy”), though they don’t materially harm momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, with good syntactic variety and high information density—most sentences are doing double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion, or image plus theme). Metaphors are mostly coherent and controlled, and momentum rarely stalls; transitions from interiority to action are smooth. There is some tendency toward elevated phrasing (“tyranny of indifference,” “sterile soil of apathy”) that grazes cliché but does not tip into purple or obscure clarity. I see no significant loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle that would materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and highly intentional, with rich imagery that usually carries multiple jobs (setting, mood, and concept at once) and little to no scaffolding or repetition. Sentences read smoothly aloud with good rhythmic variation, and modifiers are generally precise rather than florid. Figurative language is dense but thematically coherent (sound, light, mist, code), avoiding mixed metaphors or confusion even at peak beats. The only restraint keeping it from the very top is that the line-level beauty slightly outweighs narrative sharpness, but as craft it is already at a publishable elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied rhythms, dense but mostly efficient imagery, and clear sequencing of actions. The figurative language is frequent but generally coherent, and phrases like “brittle as spun sugar” and “a lone star in a field of gray” are apt. There is minor redundancy and a consistent high-register lyricism that occasionally risks purple but doesn’t obstruct clarity or momentum. Tightening a few abstract or reiterated formulations could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, carry multiple functions (image + theme + motion), and avoid scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, enhancing mood rather than obscuring sense. There are no notable loops, template cadences, or clarity infringements; the prose maintains momentum even when descriptive. A slight tendency toward purple in a couple of phrases is the only real drag on what is otherwise near–publish-ready prose.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished, with dense but mostly controlled imagery that often does double duty for setting and emotion (“scattered notes of a forgotten song” is a standout). Sentences vary in structure and length, and there are few if any outright redundancies or scaffolding phrases. A handful of metaphors (“factually mystical science,” “theoretical prisons”) flirt with abstraction or cleverness for its own sake, slightly softening impact in peak beats. Overall momentum and clarity remain strong despite the lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong sensory images (“river of mist,” “melody of luminous ache”) and generally efficient sentences that carry both mood and information. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not so dense as to obscure clarity or momentum. Redundancies are minimal, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. A few phrases flirt with purple or abstraction, but they don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-by-line, the prose is strong: imagery is vivid, metaphors generally coherent, and most sentences do double duty advancing both atmosphere and character. There is some density of figurative language (“anesthesia evaporated like a ghost, leaving a residue of cold clarity”) that approaches purple but rarely tips into muddle or redundancy. Momentum holds; reflection is well integrated with present cues and physical action, and there are few scaffold or paraphrase loops. A bit more restraint in abstraction could further sharpen already-effective images.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, imagery is generally precise, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. The prose carries multiple jobs at once (world-building, mood, character) with good information density and no obvious metaphor muddle. Lyric touches are frequent but not so dense as to become purple or obscure causality. The climax (“a silent, wrenching pull…releasing the story”) is clear and well-phrased, maintaining momentum and image without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and images that usually do more than one job (e.g., cracked clown smiles as both setting and theme). Figurative language is frequent but controlled; it rarely feels purple or redundant, and there are no meaningful loops or scaffolding artifacts. The rhythm between longer, descriptive lines and shorter, grounded actions (dragging the ladder, pushing the tile) keeps momentum. Only the occasional slightly ornate phrase keeps this from the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is dense but generally precise: images like “each crystal was a character, each branching pattern a sentence” carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, metaphor, and plot). Syntax varies well, and there is little to no scaffolding, repetition, or figurative muddle. The prose sustains a high level of lyricism without collapsing into purple or obscuring causality. Its only limitation for the very top band is the near-uniformly elevated texture, which leaves little rhythmic contrast or sharp simplicity at moments of peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are purposeful, information-dense, and generally avoid scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“starship blooming like a metal flower,” “waves of pearlescent light”) is vivid and controlled, with few mixed metaphors or muddles. The prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism, helped by clear sequencing around the storm and the shard’s transformation. Mild over-richness in a couple of lines slightly softens impact but does not impede clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, information density is high, and most metaphors are apt and mutually reinforcing. Prose efficiently advances setting, concept, and emotion in the same lines, with little redundancy or scaffolding. There is some mild purple flourish and abstract phrasing in peak moments that could be sharpened into more concrete images. Still, nothing obscures causality or closure, and the final paragraph lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and densely informative without feeling overwrought, and figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Key metaphors (hinges, starlight, captured aurora) are few enough and consistent enough to build a pattern instead of clutter. There are no evident paraphrase loops or scaffold phrases dragging momentum. The prose supports the story’s hush and wonder while remaining transparent at moments of action.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, generally economical, and often perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, and mood at once). Figurative language is frequent but usually precise and thematically aligned (sea/wood/time motifs) without collapsing into purple opacity. There is little to no scaffolding, synonym churn, or template cadence; the action of building the bulwark is clear and propulsive. A slight saturation of abstractions in the closing reflections keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and controlled, with high information density and evocative phrasing that does double duty for mood and theme. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and there’s little true scaffolding or repetition; description tends to earn its place. There is some mild purple-leaning accumulation of modifiers and abstract nouns (“profound, umbral tenderness,” “glorious secrets of the night”) that edges toward prettiness over precision. These do not damage clarity or closure but do keep the line-level craft just shy of elite minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with high information density: most sentences advance atmosphere, character, and the psychic mechanics simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors (e.g., “fever dream rendered in ink,” “sleeping beasts” dunes) are coherent and thematically aligned rather than ornamental clutter. There are no obvious paraphrase loops or structural scaffolds, and the final lines land with clean, un-muddied emphasis on the resolved symbol. A touch more syntactic variety in a couple of mid-paragraph runs would enhance rhythm, but current execution is well within elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory images and efficient sentences that often do double duty (atmosphere plus character or theme). Metaphors are generally apt and controlled, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding; the piece moves with good momentum for such a contemplative scene. The density of figurative language flirts with purple in places, but it doesn’t significantly blur sense or obscure causality. Line-level refinement could come from trimming a few ornamental modifiers to let the strongest images stand out even more.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without feeling padded. Figurative language—“velvet disquiet,” “sliver of condensed feeling,” “loud hearts”—is generally fresh and coherent, rarely tipping into purple excess. Sentence rhythms vary enough to keep momentum, and there are no clear paraphrase loops or template cadences that slow the read. A few lines edge toward decorative flourish, but not enough to blur sense or weaken the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense but largely precise; metaphors like “a thunderstorm held perfectly still in a single drop of rain” are vivid and apt for the piece’s ambitions. Most sentences perform multiple functions (world-building, mood, theme) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. While the language verges on lush in places, it stops short of genuine purple prose and does not obscure causality or action. Rhythm and clarity are maintained through the climax and closing image, keeping momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences are controlled, varied, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and action. Figurative language is present but not overstacked; images like the mountain singing or clouds parting “gently, impossibly” are clear and evocative. There are few, if any, scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and the prose maintains momentum even through reflective moments. The only ceiling here is that the style, while strong, doesn’t take many line-level risks that would push it into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied in length, and carry multiple functions (world-building, emotion, and theme) without bloating. Figurative language is generally apt and not over-stacked, with only a few phrases verging on purple but not enough to impede clarity or momentum. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the cadence supports the meditative build toward the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished, with high information density and images that often do double work (the honeycomb as both souls and unspoken words). Rhythm varies well between longer lyric sentences and punchier closures (e.g., “The latch clicked open.”). A few phrases (“profound, mute eloquence,” “tranquilly perceptive study”) flirt with purple or redundancy, but they don’t significantly impede momentum or sense. Overall, the prose supports rather than smothers the emotional turn.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with many sentences doing triple duty for character, world, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but largely disciplined, and lines like “a metallic wound spilling its secrets” and “a number made of flesh and bone” feel precise rather than purple. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony, and the final paragraph lands with a clean, charged image. A few metaphors approach the ornate, but they do not blur sense or slow momentum enough to ding the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and largely economical for its lyrical density, with many lines doing double duty for image and theme (“a slick, iridescent comma of emerald and black, curled into a perfect question mark”). Metaphoric language is frequent but mostly precise and legible; there are few, if any, outright muddled or mixed images. There is some risk of over-richness—nearly every sentence carries a figurative flourish—which slightly blunts momentum at this length. Nonetheless, clarity and cadence remain strong, and obvious loops or scaffolding are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied rhythms, precise verbs, and layered images that usually do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and controlled—geological heartbeat, metallic dew, living pillars—without collapsing into purple prose or metaphor soup. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; transitions like “Days bled into weeks” are efficient. The prose consistently supports momentum and atmosphere rather than bogging the story down.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clear, and information-dense, with metaphors that are fresh and coherent (amber as stasis/cage, footprints as mandala). There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line carries either character, atmosphere, or thematic weight. Rhythm modulates well between longer reflective lines and tighter observational ones. A few slightly ornate phrases come close to purple but remain under control.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically aware, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and tonally unified; the “ocean’s frantic librarians” and “stone finger pointing into the corpse of the sea” are striking without collapsing clarity. There’s little scaffold or repetition, and action sequencing within the quiet scene is easy to follow. The density of metaphors borders on purple in spots, modestly reducing transparency but not harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and metaphors remain coherent within the world’s logic. There are no evident loops, filler scaffolding, or clarity breaks; each paragraph advances situation or deepens emotional charge. The final sentences, especially Barrow’s sigh dissolving into the hush, provide a precise, earned cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, syntactically clean, and often striking (“time was a tide pool, with strange currents that eddied and pulled at the edges of her awareness”). Sentences reliably carry multiple functions—worldbuilding, interiority, and atmosphere—without obvious scaffolding or loops. Still, figurative language is quite frequent and occasionally borders on purple, slightly blurring rather than sharpening impact in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and image-rich, with lines like “a tooth of glacial ice that scraped the impossible heavens” and “a single, luminescent seed... a tiny, living star” achieving high-density description without major clutter. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or obvious padding. Sentence rhythm varies and maintains momentum; there’s little in the way of scaffolding, synonym loops, or dead-weight exposition. At times the lushness grazes the edge of purple, but clarity and propulsion remain intact, including at the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and images that usually carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, theme) without padding. Phrases like “a perpetual twilight that wandered the ruins of the capital” and “a mask of serene control” are vivid yet legible, and scaffolding or redundancy is minimal. Some figurative clusters (“nomadic penumbra,” “luminous absence,” “benevolently ruthless”) risk a slightly purple register when stacked, but they don’t obscure action or causality. With a light trim of the most explanatory lines, this would be publication-ready prose.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and dense without obvious scaffolding or repetition; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action). Metaphors (mercury-glass sight, hidden thunder, flower opening in the dark) are coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed or strained comparisons. Momentum is well managed; reflective passages stay tightly linked to present stakes and do not stall the piece. Line-level, this is close to ready for elite publication with only minor potential tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences are generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology. The metaphors of weaving and chess are consistent and rarely feel overwrought, despite elevated language. There is minor tendency toward lush phrasing (“woven hush,” “suffocating guilt,” “fierce repose”) that could be trimmed in a few spots for even tighter momentum, but it doesn’t obscure clarity or closure. No significant loops, syntactic monotony, or figurative muddles appear in the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, worldbuilding, and emotional pressure) with minimal scaffolding, and rhythm varies well. Metaphors like “forged hush” and “a needle aimed at the heart of the sky” are striking and mostly coherent, with no evident mixed-metaphor muddle. Occasionally the prose skirts the edge of density, but it rarely stalls momentum or obscures meaning. There are no obvious loops, clunky transitions, or technical errors that touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally lean for this lyric register, with high information density and multi-function phrasing (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme often achieved in one line). Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors (kintsugi, quilting memories, cartography of ruin) are thematically coherent and not mixed to the point of muddle. There is little paraphrase looping or scaffold, and syntax varies enough to avoid mechanical cadence. A few phrases approach purple (“dire enchantment of last chances”), but they don’t obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clear, and often do double duty for mood and character, with few redundancies. Figurative language is frequent but generally well-chosen and coherent, supporting rather than obscuring sense. There’s a slight tilt toward purple in places and some metaphors tread familiar ground, but they don’t muddy causality or dull the ending. The final image of the shell settling as a “blue speck” is cleanly rendered and lands without verbal clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, free of scaffolding and loops, and often carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, and theme in one image). Figurative language is rich but controlled; metaphors are coherent and well-matched to the scene’s mood without spiraling into purple prose. Information density is high, and there are no copy errors or confusing constructions. A few intensifiers (“pure, blustering force,” “gentle scream of pure longing”) edge toward overemphasis but do not materially dull momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally tight, with high information density—most sentences carry atmosphere, world-building, and character at once. Rhythm varies well between long, cadenced descriptions and shorter, punchier beats (“For a moment, nothing happened.”) without obvious template patterns or paraphrase loops. A few images feel slightly over-stacked or familiar (e.g., “obsidian sky,” “silver disc hung fat and heavy”) but they don’t materially blur meaning or closure. Line-level craft supports momentum and emotion effectively even if it doesn’t fully transcend into the rarefied.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level work is generally clean, vivid, and purposeful, with good information density (e.g., the whole empathy-virus premise and its psychological fallout conveyed in a few efficient lines). Sentences do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, characterization, atmosphere—without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. Metaphors are apt and not overstacked, and rhythm accelerates appropriately during the storm. Minor abstractions (“concept as precious and hard to find as the finest truffle”) are controlled and don’t impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and economical, with sentences doing multiple jobs (character, setting, and theme) and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is fairly dense but controlled and thematically unified around absence, height, sea, and light; metaphors do not conflict or confuse. Rhythm varies naturally across paragraphs, and key lines are well-placed for emphasis (especially the final image and the mountain/sea reframe). There’s minimal evidence of loops or template cadence, keeping momentum intact despite the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length, clear in syntax, and dense with information doing multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character). Figurative language (“with the patience of a glacier,” “a liquid clock ticking away his chance”) is apt and not overstacked, and exposition is embedded without clumsy scaffolding. There’s no noticeable synonym-churn, template cadence, or confusion of cause/effect, and both the opening and closing lines carry charged images. A few abstractions near the end slightly blunt the otherwise fine-grained imagery, but they don’t significantly harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with dense imagery (“bleeding starlight,” “delicate filigree of light”) that pulls double duty for atmosphere and theme. Line-level clarity is maintained despite the lyrical texture, and there are no significant loops, scaffolds, or syntactic artifacts. A few moments flirt with purple or meta (“the core concept of her dreams made real”) and the repeated “lacy menace” phrase is a touch on-the-nose, slightly flattening surprise. Overall, though, rhythm and precision keep momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, information-dense, and usually do more than one job, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. Imagery like “a sphere of glass and captured light” and “residual magic” is vivid without becoming incoherent or overwrought. There are occasional abstract or slightly purple constructions (“directed spontaneity,” “palette of resolve”) that feel conceptual rather than sensorial, but they don’t seriously impede momentum or clarity. No noticeable loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors drag on the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is fluent, varied, and image-rich without tipping into incoherence; sentences often do double duty for mood and information (“each knot in the wood like a staring, judgmental eye”). Figurative language is generally precise and thematically aligned, and rhythm modulates well between stillness and the rush of flight. There is mild density and some conceptual repetition in the emotional labels (jealousy, nostalgia, chaos) that could be trimmed for even greater sharpness, but no serious looping or artifacting.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and economical; most sentences do multiple jobs—advancing atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is generally fresh and coherent (e.g., “time in liquid heartbeats,” grief “part of his bone structure”), with no persistent purple or mixed metaphors. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffold; the narrative moves forward steadily without explanatory drag. A few phrases edge toward the familiar (e.g., “recalibrated the universe”), but they don’t blunt the closure image or momentum in any material way.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level writing is polished and musical, with high information density—most sentences carry setting, emotion, and concept simultaneously without obvious redundancy. Figurative language (crystal as frost, scars as maps) is coherent and controlled rather than stacked to the point of purple prose. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic monotony, and grammar and punctuation are clean. A few formulations (“a latticework of old pains and future fears”) and doubled intensities (“simply flaked away, revealing the soft, unblemished skin beneath”) brush close to over-lush, but they do not impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is vivid and efficient, often doing double duty for atmosphere and emotion (“a held breath, thick with the scent of decaying paper”). Sentence rhythms vary and support momentum; there are few, if any, true scaffolding or repetition artifacts. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent with the story’s tone, rarely slipping into muddle or cliché. Line-level clarity remains high even in the most heightened beats of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, rhythmically tuned, and information-dense without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is mostly precise and thematically aligned (spirals, tapestries, hush), contributing to a cohesive texture. There are a few moments of conceptual restatement that verge on redundancy, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur meaning. The final paragraphs land cleanly and musically on the image of the book falling soundlessly and her merging with the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, and most do multiple jobs (world-building, character, theme) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and non-redundant; images like “pressure shift in the air, a daily baptism” and the glacier “reaching into the machine” are vivid and coherent. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic templates that dull momentum. A slight density of metaphor in places approaches purple but doesn’t obscure clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, precise, and mostly efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and key beats (the button press, the opening, the smile) are rendered in clear, concrete images. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and syntax variety keeps the piece from feeling mechanical. A few metaphor clusters (energy fields, wildfire, physics rules) come close to repetition but don’t materially drag momentum or obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is tight and image-rich without major purple patches; most sentences do double duty for mood, character, and theme. Phrases like “a world of lucid contradictions” and “the house had finally won” are memorable and precise rather than generic. There’s minor conceptual redundancy in a few thematic sentences, but no real scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies well between longer reflective periods and succinct, scene-moving lines, keeping momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and economical: images like “hum of streetlamps,” “smelling of damp earth and ozone,” and “a musical question mark placed at the end of every emotional period” are vivid yet controlled. Sentences vary in rhythm, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, and theme) without slipping into purple or redundancy. Repetition around endings and beginnings is purposeful motif rather than scaffolding, and there are no noticeable syntactic or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“a patient archaeology of the mundane” is both image and psychological portrait). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically aligned (chemical “covenant,” “bruise” of evening, “blooming jetty”), avoiding muddled or mixed metaphors. There is little scaffolding or redundancy; each paragraph adds new texture or stakes, and transitions are smooth. The density of imagery comes close to overrich at times, but it does not materially slow or obscure the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and rarely redundant; metaphors are fresh and generally well-chosen. The prose balances scene and summary efficiently, keeping momentum without feeling rushed. There’s minor overtness at the end but no real purple-prose or scaffold artifacts, and rhythm holds under the emotional turn. Overall, it reads as carefully revised and ready for print with only marginal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong image-to-image flow, high information density, and minimal scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Metaphors (languages of growth and rain, rivers singing with minerals) are largely coherent and voice-consistent. At times the figurative layering edges toward purple, but it doesn’t obscure meaning or stall momentum. There are no major syntactic artifacts, loops, or clarity issues, though a touch more restraint at peak beats could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lean yet lyrical, with many lines doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (“silence that had weight,” “discard the chaff and the grain together”). Sentences vary in length and structure, and there’s no evident scaffolding, synonym churn, or repetitive stems. Figurative language is mostly tight and coherent; the agricultural “threshing/harvest” motif extends logically from his motivation to the closing image. A couple of abstract formulations could be slightly sharpened, but they don’t impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Key metaphors (harbor as cathedral, silence as something that can be mapped and argued with) are coherent and sustained. There is some repetition and mild purple tendency around “silence” and luminous/mournful descriptors that could be trimmed for even greater sharpness. Still, clarity is never compromised, and the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density; most sentences do double duty for mood and character or plot. Imagery is strong and mostly controlled, though the density of figurative language in spots (“volcanic eruption,” “cauterizing blast,” “volcanic heat,” “resolve as hard as diamond”) brushes against purple and risks slight redundancy. There are no significant clarity issues, scaffolding, or repetition loops that slow momentum. Tightening a few abstract thematic sentences near the end would further heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory images and generally efficient sentences that carry both atmosphere and emotion (“metallic flora,” “a living ghost in a white room”). Information density is high and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Some metaphors risk mild purple-prose accumulation (e.g., “at the hush of the universe inhaling”), but they remain legible and thematically aligned rather than muddling clarity. Rhythm and syntax vary well enough to maintain momentum through predominantly descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lean yet evocative, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and information. Figurative language is striking and generally coherent, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. A few metaphors flirt with purple (“poisoned bruise,” “whispers travel farther than shouts”) but they don’t impede clarity or momentum. Line-level craft is strong and publication-ready, though not at the level of rarefied precision that would push into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is controlled and polished, with strong sensory images and generally efficient sentences that each carry multiple functions (setting, mood, and theme). While the figurative language is dense, metaphors are coherent and aligned, avoiding mixed or overwrought images that would blur meaning. Momentum is well maintained for a lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences perform multiple functions (world-building, mood, interiority) without becoming bloated. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. There’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition; the prose maintains forward momentum despite its meditative tone. A few dense phrases (“a constant, static-filled broadcast only he could receive”) push toward over-decoration, keeping this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, theme) with good economy, and images like “a dancer among grunting laborers” or “waterfalls of brine cascaded from its sides” are vivid without becoming muddled. There is minimal redundancy and no major scaffolding or template-cadence artifacts. A few phrases edge toward purple or abstract (“subterranean fringe,” “sharp edges of conflict”) but do not obscure sense or momentum. Overall, rhythm and clarity support the scene’s escalation and closure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong verbs, vivid yet disciplined figurative language, and minimal scaffolding. Images like “curls of wood that fell like whispers” and the turbines as a “monstrous, uncaring heart” do layered work without becoming purple. Sentence rhythms vary naturally and support the accumulative tension and quiet ending. I see no significant repetition, muddle, or artifacting that obscures action or dulls the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and few if any redundancies or scaffolding artifacts. Figurative language is frequent but mostly purposeful and sensorially coherent, supporting tone rather than obscuring meaning. There is a slight tilt toward purple prose and abstraction in spots, which risks softening momentum in such a short piece, but the closure image remains clear and undulled. Grammar, sequencing, and pronoun references are all clean.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, with high information density—sentences typically advance character, world, and mood at once. Imagery like “a sound of profound and unadorned beauty” and the moonflower’s unfurling is clear and effective, and loops or scaffolding are minimal. A few phrases lean on familiar patterns (“tears tracing paths through the soot,” “settled deep in his bones”), slightly dulling freshness but not clarity or momentum. Syntax and punctuation are clean, and the cadence supports a smooth build to the final note.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory images and a high information-to-sentence ratio; most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus theme). There is some leaning toward lushness, but figurative language stays legible and thematically aligned, and repetition of “golden” reads as motif rather than inadvertent loop. Syntax is varied and fluent, and there are no clarity-impairing artifacts or redundancies that blunt the closure. Overall, the line-level craft would need only light tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, with many lines doing double duty for image and theme, and there are few redundant or purely scaffolding sentences. Metaphors are mostly controlled and apt (grief as smith, meteor shower as “tears of fire”), and paragraphing supports momentum despite the reflective, quiet plot. There is a mild tendency toward density and “purple” phrasing in spots (“hummed with a silence deeper than any he had known,” “withering to bloom again”), which occasionally feels ornamental rather than pressure-bearing. Nonetheless, clarity remains high, and the closure image is not obscured by figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and strong, specific images (“each drop a momentary lens magnifying the bruised twilight”). Most lines carry dual weight—advancing both atmosphere and concept. There is some elevated, conceptual language, but it largely fits the voice and doesn’t bog momentum. I see no major loops or muddled metaphors that would obscure sense, especially at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, dense, and usually do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, interiority, and mood). Vivid phrases like “atoms of nostalgia” and “a tomb of wonders” show a strong ear, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Some metaphorical density—“exquisite, unbearable clarity,” “a different silence, one filled with the weight of a billion perfect moments”—brushes against purple prose but stays intelligible. Overall, the prose propels rather than clogs, with only minor risk of overrichness.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding and emotion together). Some metaphor clusters verge on purple or familiar (“poisonous vine strangling a perfect rose,” “shape of hope”), and there’s occasional conceptual redundancy around shadow, cage, vine imagery. However, clarity and momentum are preserved throughout, and the final images land cleanly. Line-level tightening—especially trimming one or two metaphor stacks—would move this toward top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences are varied, sensory density is high, and most lines do multiple jobs (character, mood, and world). Descriptions like “a silent mountain of patience” and the color shift along the chameleon’s spine are vivid without becoming muddled. There is some tendency toward abstraction and repeated conceptual framing (“his own convictions felt just as shattered…”), which slightly dulls momentum in places. Still, there are no major loops or artifacts, and clarity remains intact through the climax and closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty (advancing action and deepening image), and figurative language is precise and coherent (“door being ripped from its hinges” as a model for the scar’s story). There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum is appropriate for a reflective piece. The prose occasionally flirts with purple, but images are rarely stacked to the point of obscuring sense, and the closure image is clear. Minor tightening could come from trimming a few near-synonymous abstractions (“truth,” “perfect, awful preservation”) without changing substance.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly well-chosen and coherent, supporting atmosphere without collapsing into muddle; images like the letters on a velvet cushion under the klieg light are both visual and thematic. There are no noticeable copy errors or confusing pronoun moments, and narrative momentum is maintained despite the reflective mode. The main restraint is that the density of metaphor approaches the upper limit before tipping into purple, though it largely stays on the right side of that line.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally lean despite the lyricism, and most metaphors (“smoked glass,” “soul-scribe,” “cosmic plainsong”) are coherent and mutually reinforcing. Information density is high, with little scaffold or paraphrase looping; nearly every line advances atmosphere, concept, or Elara’s state. There is some risk of purple prose through stacked abstractions in the middle exposition of the stardust revelation, but clarity remains intact and the closure image lands cleanly. Rhythm and paragraphing support the gradual swell toward epiphany and the quieter, grounded ending.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and economical for its lyric density: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and character at once) without lapsing into redundancy or muddled metaphor. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and coherent with the story’s quantum/ghostly conceits; phrases like “occasionally everywhere” and “a quantum ghost of history” feel integral rather than ornamental. There are no obvious loops, syntactic monotony, or line-level confusions, and the final image is clear and charged. A slight reduction in abstract nouns (“probabilistic haze,” “cascading mathematics of reality”) could increase immediacy, but momentum never truly stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied in structure, and carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) without obvious redundancy. Imagery is often striking yet controlled (“silent, roaring moment,” “bed of woven copper moss”), and there are few, if any, genuine loops or scaffolding phrases. The main limitation is occasional drift into slightly purple or expository abstraction at high-intensity beats, which mutes sharpness rather than enhancing it. Still, momentum and clarity are well-maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, musical, and information-dense, with images that mostly remain coherent and non-redundant (“lantern that pulsed with the light of a captured firefly,” “a country of ghosts”). Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to obscure sense, and there is little to no scaffolding, synonym churn, or mechanical cadence. The final paragraph in particular balances image and clarity with an effective cadence. Some metaphors edge close to purple, but they rarely blur meaning or stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and figurative language that rarely overreaches. Images such as “phantom tingle…like a constant, low-voltage accusation” and “a frostbite that felt like clarity” work doubly for character and theme. There’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or muddled metaphor, and transitions are smooth. A few elevated phrases cluster in the opening, but they remain legible and purposeful, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and action), the rhythm breathes appropriately across beats, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and controlled, with metaphors (“a tremor, soft as falling silk”) that enhance rather than blur meaning. Information flow remains clear even in dense descriptive passages, and the closure image is sharp and undiluted. A slight tendency toward uniformly lush diction in all beats keeps it just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences are clean, well-paced, and information-dense; most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is generally apt and not overstacked, with only an occasional familiar image (“sun bled into the horizon”) slightly flattening the texture. There’s no evident synonym-churn, scaffolding, or confusing syntax, and the closure image is sharp and legible. A touch more syntactic variety or one or two more surprising turns of phrase could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, information is dense but not muddy, and nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or motion. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly precise and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or significant purple drift. There’s minimal scaffold or repetition, and the final sentences land crisply on concrete images (receivers, satellite blink, echo). It falls just short of the highest band because the density of adornment occasionally approaches ornament, where a touch more austerity might heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and causality) with minimal redundancy, and the rhythm breathes appropriately through setup, ritual, and closure. Figurative language (“steam coiling…like ghosts of the old world,” amber dissolving “like golden sugar”) is vivid and mostly restrained, not piled into purple density. There are almost no scaffolding phrases or paraphrase loops; momentum stays forward. A few metaphors (“tapestry of what it meant to be human”) are familiar rather than fresh, but they don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and nearly every image does double duty for atmosphere and psychology. Metaphors are coherent and thematically linked (ice in veins, the storm of her nervous system, the pearl of stillness) without stacking to the point of muddle. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; the prose mostly trusts concrete detail rather than re-explaining. A hair off the very top because a couple of explanatory lines slightly soften the otherwise razor-sharp show-don’t-tell execution.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong verbs, concrete nouns, and layered metaphors that mostly reinforce each other (threads, currents, maps, spirals). The text maintains momentum despite its lyric density, with few if any scaffold sentences or paraphrase loops. There is some risk of over-saturation—nearly every paragraph carries figurative language—which slightly blurs emphasis and could be pared for maximal impact. Nonetheless, clarity and cadence hold through the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and multitask (world, mood, and character often advanced at once). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and non-redundant, with no obvious loops or scaffolding. A few metaphors (“each heartbeat a cavernous echo, each falling stone a slow-motion ballet of destruction”) flirt with purple but stop short of obscuring sense or momentum. Overall propulsion and clarity are preserved, including at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and a good balance between lyricism and clarity; lines often do double duty for atmosphere and character. Phrases like “ventilation, a ghost in the machine” and “data-vaults…their green lights blinking with placid ignorance” show controlled, purposeful figurative language. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and sentence structures vary enough to keep momentum. A slight tendency toward stacked abstractions in a couple of spots (“sanctity of the archive and the stability it represented”) keeps it from feeling utterly sharp-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished and controlled, with rich imagery (“sun bled across the silica dunes,” “a brutal sliver of honed steel against the gentle clutter”) that rarely tips into purple. Sentences generally do double duty—advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously—and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Line-level clarity is strong; action and emotional beats are easy to follow, and the closure image lands cleanly. A few phrases lean toward familiar lyricism (“fire of sunset,” “phantom memory”), but they don’t significantly dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) and avoid obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is frequent but largely well-chosen and consistent with the world’s logic, keeping imagery clear even when dense. There are few if any grammatical or clarity slips, and progression within paragraphs is easy to follow. Some metaphors could be trimmed for maximal concision, but they do not significantly drag momentum or obscure cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and mostly free of redundancy. Metaphors are consistent with the astronomical and print motifs, and while they verge on lush, they rarely tip into true purple. There are a few slightly on-the-nose formulations and explanatory tags that could be trimmed for even greater sharpness. Overall, rhythm and clarity hold well, including at the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (atmosphere, characterization, and forward motion) with minimal redundancy, and there is no evident synonym churn or scaffold. Figurative language is frequent but well-curated; the recurring astronomical and acoustic imagery forms a coherent pattern rather than purple sprawl. Rhythm modulates well between long, lush sentences in calmer description and tighter phrasing around key beats like the firmware’s translation and the final “Papa.” There are no artifacts or loops that blunt the impact of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most lines carry atmosphere, worldbuilding, and emotional shading at once. Metaphoric language is frequent but mostly controlled, and images like “a soundless scream held in the collective throat” are strong and legible. There is minor risk of purple prose in stacked modifiers and abstractions, yet it does not obscure sense or slow momentum materially. I see little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the line-level craft is near-publishable with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, evocative, and rhythmically varied, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and information. Imagery such as “sky was a web of crystalline fractures” and “his mind an endlessly looping recording of screaming and heat” is vivid without tripping into incoherence. While the language is lush, it avoids obvious synonym loops or scaffolding, and the scene advances steadily without line-level drag. A few constructions verge on purple, but they stay legible and thematically consonant, so momentum remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences are generally tight, purposeful, and rhythmically varied, with rich but mostly controlled figurative language serving both mood and worldbuilding. A few phrases approach purple (“a smell that tasted like silver and honey on the tongue”), yet they fit the synesthetic, magical ambience and do not obscure meaning or momentum. There are no obvious loops, scaffold sentences, or structural artifacts; information density stays high across the short length. Line-level craft is strong and polished, though not quite at the razor-edged precision of top-tier literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most do multiple jobs (advancing action, character, and mood together). Metaphors like “hope so fragile it felt like spun glass” and “willowglass hope” are striking but not so dense as to feel purple. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the prose keeps momentum through technical description without bogging down. A few phrases flirt with over-lyricism, but they don’t blur clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clean grammar, and a high density of lines doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and action at once). Figurative language is present but mostly disciplined and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or clutter. A few phrases lean toward abstraction (“a symphony of sensations that had no name”), but they don’t obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image. There are no obvious loops, synonym churn, or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense—most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and theme simultaneously. Imagery like “canyons of forgotten things” and “unearthed silence” is vivid yet coherent with the setting. There’s some reliance on metaphor and abstraction, but it stops short of purple prose and doesn’t obscure causality or closure. I see little scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong verbs and sensory concreteness that usually do multiple jobs at once (e.g., the snow code both visualizes information and underscores ephemerality). Rhythm varies well between longer, atmospheric sentences and sharp, focused ones at emotional beats. Figurative language—“silver hush,” “a promise of spring on the tilt of the earth,” “sharp enough to cut glass”—is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, without obvious mixed metaphors or scaffolding. There’s minimal redundancy; nearly every sentence advances character, mood, or stakes, though a few abstractions (“faith in a faithless world”) are slightly less vivid than the surrounding texture.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, and most carry multiple layers of work (image, emotion, and theme). Figurative language is dense but controlled; metaphors such as the palimpsest promise and “bubbles in slow-boiling tar” are coherent and support mood rather than obscuring sense. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each paragraph advances either the emotional or imagistic argument. A slight tendency toward lushness keeps it just shy of the absolute top.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied in structure, and densely informative, with most metaphors (clay’s memory, the world “fired into a brittle, grey ceramic”) both apt and thematically loaded. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to blur sense, and there is little to no paraphrase looping or scaffolding. Rhythm on the page supports the meditative tone while still advancing action. A few abstractions in the final paragraph could be sharpened by image, but they don’t materially dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: most lines do double duty (mood plus characterization, action plus theme), and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The figurative language (e.g., “sheet of rippling silver,” “compacted soil of his solitude,” “quivering hush”) is occasionally lush but remains coherent and grounded in the story’s imagery set. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum in a contemplative piece; the prose never becomes so purple that it obscures action or causality. Minor overrich moments exist but don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“sea of forgotten clouds,” “atomically reflective expanse”) and generally clean, varied syntax. Most sentences do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and internal state without redundant looping. The figurative language leans lush but stays coherent to the piece’s logic; there are no major mixed metaphors or cadence artifacts that obscure sense. A few formulations feel slightly familiar or expository, but they don’t meaningfully blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, high information density, and images that typically do multiple jobs at once (e.g., droplets as jewels that “hold” the sky echoing her desire to hold connection). Momentum is appropriate for a lyric, reflection-driven piece, and there is little to no scaffolding or repetition. At times the figurative stack borders on lush (“prismatic quiet,” “constellation of human hearts,” “vast, intricate web”), nudging toward sentimentality and slightly blurring edge and precision. Tightening a few of the more abstract, summary-like phrases in the final third would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty (world-building and mood; character and concept). Metaphors are apt and thematically aligned—analog warmth vs. static, hum vs. shout—without piling up into purple overload, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. Sentence rhythm varies enough to keep momentum, especially around the activation and observation beats, and technical terms are used precisely. The main ceiling comes from a few slightly familiar phrasings (“knot of dread,” “tension draining from her shoulders”) that are competent but not as fresh as the best lines.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: most sentences do multiple jobs, advancing atmosphere and story together, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“skeletal ruin… clawing at a canopy of indifferent starlight,” “profound spatial mutiny”) is evocative and mostly coherent, though it occasionally brushes against excess. Syntax and punctuation are clean, with clear cause/effect even during the chaotic climax. A bit more restraint in metaphor density during peak stress would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally strong, dense, and purposeful; most sentences do double duty for mood and meaning. Metaphors (wound in the earth, void as killer, mist as spirit) are coherent and thematically aligned, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. At times, figurative language comes close to saturation, risking a slightly “purple” feel in places, but clarity and momentum remain intact. The final paragraph is clean and precise, delivering the closure image without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do at least two jobs (advancing plot while deepening mood or character) and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphor use is vivid but generally disciplined; recurring images (water/air/dampness, nails, erasure) feel deliberate rather than ornamental. The prose reads cleanly with no grammatical distractions or confusing syntax. A touch more variation in figurative texture at peak beats could avoid slight purple-fringe risk, but it doesn’t impede clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically aware, and packed with information doing double duty (worldbuilding plus emotional register). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and earned, with only occasional near-purple moments that risk saturation. There is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; most lines advance either pressure, image, or insight. The final sentence lands cleanly as both image and thematic charge without being over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is tight, image-rich, and largely free of scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances either atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, with no major mixed metaphors or density-induced muddle, and the rhythm flexes appropriately between description and key turns. Transitional summary (e.g., the startup’s meteoric fall) is economical and clear. One could argue for trimming a few abstract turns of phrase in the final moralizing sentences, but they don’t significantly dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with meaningful images; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). Figurative language is rich but largely coherent with the story’s cosmological lexicon, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few abstractions (“translation of sorrow,” “shared cosmic loneliness”) slightly dilute sharpness in the highest-intensity beats. Overall, line-level control is strong and publication-ready with only minor tightening possible for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight, lyrical, and purposeful; sentences usually carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) without bogging down. Metaphors (obsidian water, frozen blossoms screaming, serenity as a blade) are vivid and coherent, with minimal stacking or muddle. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases, and the closure beat is clear and undiluted. A mild density of figurative language in places edges toward purple but does not significantly impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is generally strong, with varied syntax, clean grammar, and metaphors that are vivid and mostly coherent with the established imagery. Sentences often do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and character (“These were the Dissonance scars, the marks of temporal trauma shared by every survivor” grounds world, stakes, and interiority). There is some density of abstract nouns and high-register phrasing that edges toward purple in places, but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or momentum. The piece avoids obvious loops or scaffolding and lands on a clear, resonant final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-by-line prose is polished: sentences are purposeful, image-rich, and mostly do multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and theme) without scaffolding. Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (holes, voids, bones, sunlight), and there’s minimal redundancy or synonym churn; rhythm supports the scene’s meditative pressure. A few phrases (“stained with soil and sorrow,” “foolish, reckless idealist’s prayer”) flirt with familiar lyric moves, but they are anchored by concrete surrounding detail and don’t become purple. Momentum holds throughout and the closure image is crisp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, purposeful, and often do double duty for scene and theme, with minimal redundancy. Figurative language is mostly precise and cohesive (e.g., “anchor to the whole shipwreck,” “fortress of facts,” “echo valley longing for a new sound”) without sliding into purple. Momentum is preserved even through reflective passages because each metaphor concretely advances either setting or inner state. One or two slightly resonant-but-familiar constructions (“thick blanket,” “gnawing need”) keep this from feeling utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors (life as waveform, seed like a collapsed star, ambitions as “beautiful, hollow ghosts”) are largely coherent and thematically apt, with little sense of muddled imagery or synonym churn. A few phrases verge on abstract or elevated (“the physics of transition itself”) but remain anchored enough in concrete action (tending flora, soil under nails) to avoid purple excess. Momentum is appropriate to a contemplative piece, and there are no notable loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and image-rich (“a sliver of polished bone,” “empathetic heat”), with high information density and very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent, serving atmosphere and theme without collapsing into purple prose. Sentence rhythm varies well, supporting a meditative but not stagnant momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line craft is strong: prose is dense with imagery yet generally precise, and most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) without redundancy. A few metaphors (“light, thick as honey,” “planet’s long, slow song,” “ice of isolation”) stack toward purple, but they cohere rather than clash. There’s minimal scaffold or repetition, and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. The high-lyric register comes very close to saturation in the climax, which slightly softens impact but doesn’t obscure action or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) with little dead weight, and rhythm varies in step with the contemplative mode. Figurative language is frequent but mostly well-chosen and internally consistent, avoiding mixed metaphors or real purple-prose bloat. There are minor moments where intensifiers or stacked metaphors come close to excess but they don’t blur sense or stall momentum. Overall, the prose would need only light tightening to be magazine-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, image-dense, and multi-functional, advancing both atmosphere and concept. Metaphors are mostly consistent with the library’s physics (light, echoes, delay), and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. There is some risk of purple prose from stacked modifiers (“soft, sourceless light into a pearlescent sea,” “entire, un-redacted manuscript of a broken heart”), which occasionally feels like ornament rather than added pressure. Nonetheless, momentum holds, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, high in information density, and generally do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without padding. Metaphors like “a tear frozen into music” and “a man who polishes thrones for a living” are vivid and controlled, and there are no serious loops or scaffolding artifacts. The prose is lush enough that, in a few places, it flirts with purple (“mulberry ache,” “velvet cage”) but it remains legible and purposeful. Tightening one or two heavily modified phrases could sharpen momentum without sacrificing tone.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, varied in rhythm, and carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) efficiently. Imagery is generally precise and non-redundant, with only occasional lean toward the familiar (“great, star-dusted oblivion,” “symphony of noise without form”). There’s no noticeable scaffolding, synonym loops, or figurative muddle that harms clarity, and the final image lands cleanly. The prose is lush but not so dense as to stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences have varied rhythm, pull double duty (image + psychology), and avoid redundancy. Metaphors are mostly clean and thematically aligned with growth and cycles, and the prose maintains clarity even when it becomes more figurative. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the piece feels tightly edited.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lean yet lush, with high information density—images like “the last ember… surrendered its ghost of heat” and the envelope of cash on the railing each do multiple jobs. Sentence rhythm varies well between long, atmospheric lines and shorter, sharper actions, maintaining momentum. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; it coheres around a tight cluster of elements (wind, sound, light, weight) rather than veering into mixed-metaphor territory. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the final paragraph lands cleanly on a charged, economical image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and evocative images that rarely tip into muddle (“sycamore hush,” “starlight was sharp enough to cut”). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, supporting mood and theme. There are a few borderline-purple moments and explanatory sentences that could be tightened, yet none significantly drag momentum or obscure cause and effect. Overall, this is well above most submissions and nearly ready at sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense: most sentences do double duty with worldbuilding and emotional charge. Imagery like “a map of sorrow in the sky” and “the canyon’s acoustic heart” feels apt and memorable rather than overwrought. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles, and momentum is maintained despite the reflective mode. A touch of leanness in a few descriptive phrases could sharpen impact further for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with vivid, mostly coherent metaphors and strong verb choices; lines often do double duty for setting and theme. Sentence variety and paragraphing support momentum, and there is no obvious synonym churn or scaffold. A few abstractions (“automated, soulless craft,” “a concept laughed out of modern lecture halls”) edge toward summary, but they don’t significantly drag pace or obscure action. The final paragraph’s declarative wisdom is more tell than show, but it remains syntactically clean and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, musical, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and character while avoiding overt repetition or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly well-judged and coherent, and rhythm shifts appropriately between contemplative and tense moments. A few images and adjectives (“skeletal city asleep in the abyss,” “celestial river”) sit near the edge of familiarity, but they don’t materially dull the strong, clear closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm and structure, with high information density and little to no scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and thematically aligned; it rarely tips into muddle or self-contradiction. The prose maintains momentum even in reflective passages, and crucial beats are dramatized rather than summarized. A few lines approach purple, but they do not obscure clarity or dilute the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density and many sentences doing double duty for setting, mood, and character (“It wasn't a jewel; it was a scar given form”). Syntax varies nicely, and the final image is clear and resonant. However, figurative language is very frequent—nearly every paragraph has multiple metaphors—creating a mild sense of purple overgrowth that slightly blunts impact. There are no significant clarity or redundancy issues, but some pruning would sharpen the already striking images.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a good ratio of image to information; most lines do at least two jobs (world, mood, or character). Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (music, silence, sleep, song) rather than mixed for effect, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping. The climactic adjustment of the drips is described clearly and efficiently despite its conceptual subtlety. Density is high, but not so ornate as to impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean, purposeful, and layered, often doing atmospheric and narrative work at once. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and transitions between summary and scene are smooth. The figurative language is frequent but largely controlled; only occasionally does it verge on purple without adding proportional pressure. The prose sustains momentum in a reflective story without feeling rushed or mechanically “literary.”

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, rhythmic, and clear, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Some passages lean into purple—stacked modifiers and ornate phrasing (“air humming with a unique stillness,” “kaleidoscopic waterfall that fractured sunlight into a thousand dancing rainbows”) that could be tightened without loss. Despite occasional density, causality and imagery remain legible, and there are few obvious scaffolding or repetition artifacts. Overall momentum holds, with only mild risk of ornament shading into excess.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: varied sentence structures, clean syntax, and a good balance of image and clarity. Figurative language is selective and apt; metaphors like “roaring deafness,” “his reflection a ghost,” and “soundless echo through the vast, dark quiet” sharpen rather than blur. Information density is high with minimal redundancy, and technical terms remain accessible. Momentum holds throughout, with no evident scaffolding, synonym loops, or confusing metaphors, and the final sentence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished, with strong images (“dust motes danced in the slanted light of a sun that no longer remembered its original name”) and generally efficient sentences that carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. A few phrases verge on the abstract or familiar (“shattered soul,” “profound emotional numbness”), but they’re anchored by specific sensory or conceptual context so they don’t read as scaffolding. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final lines land with a clear, charged image rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, with many sentences doing double duty—advancing action while building mood or theme (“The day’s cacophony of manufactured puzzles…dissolved into the cool night air”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and not self-contradictory, and syntactic variety keeps momentum. There are a few spots of mild redundancy or near-purple rhetoric (e.g., stacked abstractions in the final sentence), yet they don’t seriously obscure clarity or dull the closure image. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive venues, though a light trim could heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong verbs and purposeful images (“a silence so dense it felt like a physical weight,” “the pull cord handle hung from its cradle like a silent promise”). Most sentences carry multiple functions—building atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously—without obvious padding. The figurative language occasionally approaches lush, but it stops short of purple; clarity and momentum are maintained through the climax. There’s little to no evident scaffolding or redundancy at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is generally tight, with high information density—most sentences do double duty in mood-setting and characterization. Figurative language is rich but not so stacked as to blur sense, and there are few if any redundancies or scaffold phrases. Phrases like “a terrible, specific hope” and “violent, shrieking edges of the portal” are sharp and concrete enough to carry emotional charge. There are minor leanings toward conceptual/philosophical phrasing that could be trimmed or grounded, but they do not significantly impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and dense with imagery, but most metaphors are coherent and in service of mood or character rather than decorative excess; rhythm varies nicely across paragraphs. Sentences generally multitask—advancing plot, revealing character, and building atmosphere simultaneously—and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few phrases (“twilight bled purple across the blasted heath,” “quiet, fractured soul”) flirt with the familiar, but they don’t seriously blunt clarity or momentum. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive markets, even if not utterly flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and image-rich, with many lines doing double-duty for atmosphere and concept (“listening for the shape of the roar’s absence” is especially strong). Sentences largely advance either tension or thematic framing without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The figurative density is high but usually coherent and purposeful rather than muddled. A few phrases approach purple (e.g., slightly stacked abstractions about reality and potential), yet they don’t materially obscure action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally tight, vivid, and purposeful, with strong images like the ferry sliding out of reality “like a bead of water skittering off a waxed leaf.” Most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without padding, and momentum is maintained despite lyrical density. There are a few stacked metaphors and abstract phrases (“a feeling of permanent transient”) that edge toward purple but do not significantly blur clarity or closure. No obvious loops, scaffold sentences, or mechanical cadences undercut the key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful, with most doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and interiority at once). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent; metaphors (fever dream architect, tectonic plate of sensation) support the surreal atmosphere without becoming muddled. There’s little to no scaffolding, synonym loops, or filler, and the closure image is crisp. At times the diction edges toward purple, but it doesn’t obscure sense or undercut momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong verbs and clear syntax; nearly every sentence advances either worldbuilding, character, or theme. Metaphors are frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful (abyss as new ocean, edges as information), avoiding the muddle or redundancy that would drag momentum. There are few if any scaffold sentences or paraphrase loops; the piece feels dense rather than padded. The style does verge on ornate in places, but it remains legible and aligned with the contemplative tone, not purple for its own sake.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, mostly tight, and frequently do double duty (worldbuilding plus mood, or character plus theme). Metaphors like “a moth fluttering against a windowpane” are apt and not overstacked, and there’s little to no synonym churn or scaffolding. A few phrases (“cathedral of glass and steel where echoes went to die,” “reeling hush”) flirt with purple but stay legible and earned by the tone. Information flows clearly, with no noticeable loops or clutter to sap momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, metaphors are generally apt (“fossilized leviathans,” “crashing hush”), and description does double duty for mood and worldbuilding. There’s very little scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line earns its keep. The figurative density occasionally edges toward the lush, but it doesn’t obscure sense or momentum, and key beats (collapse, phasing, insertion, release) are clear and well-paced. No significant artifacts, loops, or syntactic monotony drag on the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, character) and flow without obvious scaffolding or repetition artifacts. Figurative language—“salvage operation for the soul,” “perfect map of beautiful nothingness”—is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, matching the piece’s contemplative mode. Grammar and sequencing are clear, and paragraphs are shaped around conceptual beats rather than mechanical motion. A slight tendency toward lushness and abstraction in the final didactic sentences keeps it from the topmost band.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: sentences are varied, information-dense, and each tends to carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious redundancy. Imagery is rich but largely controlled, with metaphors coherent to the world’s logic (canyon as hurricane of echoes, tone like a mountain-sized string). The prose accelerates into the climax with economical moves (“Silence.” then the blooming of a single sound), showing good rhythmic judgment. There is mild risk of over-lushness, but it never muddies clarity or stalls momentum at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is tight: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is vivid and controlled (e.g., “placid, unnerving silence of a forest after a fire”; “his sharp edges softening like wax near a flame”) without slipping into mixed metaphors or purple churn. There are no noticeable paraphrase loops, filler scaffolding, or rhythmically monotonous stretches, and the final paragraph lands cleanly without over-explaining. Prose momentum remains strong despite being reflective, because each reflection directly alters how we read the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, with strong verbs and vivid metaphors (“apple blossoms were the color of old bruises,” “a whisper that could slide between the atoms of the air”). Information density is high; most lines do at least two jobs (image + mood, or action + world-building). There is some tendency toward lushness and repeated figurative intensity, but it rarely muddies clarity or momentum. No significant scaffolding, loops, or syntactic monotony impede the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and rhythmic, information is dense without obvious scaffolding, and metaphors are mostly clear and apt (“second skin of grit and compromise,” “a prayer sent not to a god, but through a loophole”). The prose sustains atmosphere while advancing action; there are no significant loops, clutter, or grammatical slips. There is a mild tendency toward metaphor stack and lushness in multiple consecutive sentences, which edges close to purple but remains controlled enough not to blur clarity or pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density—most lines do double duty for mood and character. Figurative language (“spun moonlight,” “misting hush,” “string of rusted carriages slumbering”) is vivid and mostly well-calibrated; it rarely tips into muddle or redundancy. There are no obvious loops, scaffold sentences, or syntactic monotony, and the climactic paragraph maintains clarity despite increased intensity. A very slight tendency toward lushness keeps it from the absolute top band, but not from immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, metaphors are generally precise and thematically apt (“edges frayed like memories worn thin by time”), and there’s strong information density without bloat. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent, and it usually does double duty for mood and character. There are no visible scaffold loops or clunky transitions; the momentum through the central ritual is especially clean. The occasional purple-leaning phrase is the only thing separating this from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and imagery that usually does more than one job (advancing plot, revealing character, and setting tone simultaneously). Some phrases verge on purple (“hush of improbable beginnings,” “galaxy in miniature”), but they are coherent and pattern-consistent rather than muddled, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Momentum is well-managed for a lyric piece; each paragraph adds new pressure or texture. With very minor tightening of modifiers, this would be elite-line-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally graceful and image-rich, with good rhythm and few outright clumsy sentences. At times, figurative density edges toward purple (“beautiful, terrible thing,” “hush of cosmic possibility,” “profound silence fell”), and some abstractions repeat without new nuance, slightly softening impact. Even so, clarity is never lost, and most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus theme). Minor tightening of repeated emotional descriptors would make the line-level work more surgical.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and very few redundant sentences; most lines do double duty for mood and plot. Imagery such as “cathedral of glass and rusted iron” and “broken constellations” is vivid without slipping into incoherence or mixed metaphor. The rhythm shifts appropriately between technical description and charged interior beats, maintaining momentum. There is the occasional phrase that edges toward purple (“crisp nostalgia of a forgotten sun-warmed afternoon”), but it doesn’t materially drag clarity or pace.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “skin was a tapestry of fine, silvery scars, as if he'd been put back together from the shards of a broken mirror” are vivid and clean. Sentences generally carry multiple functions (setting, character, mood) without bloating, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Some metaphors and abstractions (“combative tenderness,” “calluses on the soul”) approach the edge of over-explanation, but they don’t materially harm clarity or closure. Overall, rhythm, syntax variety, and precision are solidly publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lines are generally clean, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and action) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Imagery like “a miniature galaxy of wonder contained within its shell” is vivid yet legible, and chronology remains clear throughout. There is some drift toward purple prose and stacked abstractions (“shimmering mist,” “color of wonder,” “radiant hush”) that begin to blur edges rather than sharpen them, though they do not obscure meaning. Overall, the prose is polished and fluid, just short of truly sharp minimalism or idiosyncratic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density; most lines advance both atmosphere and meaning (“starlight…shattered into a thousand trembling shards of light on the floor, a constant, silent dance”). Figurative language is frequent but generally clean and non-contradictory, and the metaphors (masks, knots, accumulated silence) are coherent with the world logic. There are no obvious scaffold sentences or synonym loops, and momentum holds well for a lyric piece. It stops just short of the most dazzling bands because the imagery, while strong, stays within a fairly consistent register without taking unexpected rhythmic risks.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is tight and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and meaning (e.g., lichen “like faded paint” both visualizes and foreshadows the fresco-vault revelation). Figurative language is controlled and coherent; metaphors extend rather than collide, and there’s minimal scaffold or repetition. Momentum is maintained despite the quiet mode, and transitions between thought, setting, and action are clean. There are no noticeable line-level artifacts, syntactic monotony, or clarity issues to undercut the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that do multiple jobs (“pages swollen into pale, indecipherable flowers” both sets mood and hints at lost knowledge). Exposition is effectively compressed—backstory via the note feels efficient rather than dump-like—and there’s little to no paraphrase looping or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined, rarely tipping into purple or muddled metaphor. The main limiter is the slightly expository, abstract stretch in the “equation I had sought” paragraph, which dulls momentum a bit compared to the more image-driven surrounding lines.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally well-shaped, varied, and information-dense, and the prose handles complex images (glyphs, fractals, atmospheric systems) without losing sense. There is some adjective and metaphor stacking (“fine, cool mist coiled,” “driftingly alert calm,” “sea of clouds”) that verges on purple, but it rarely muddies action or stakes. Redundancy is minimal and the scene moves forward with each paragraph. The final image is clear and cleanly phrased, giving the ending a satisfying cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are clean, well-paced, and multi-functional, usually advancing character, world, and mood at once; there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language like “the familiar, weightless lurch” and “iron-clad grief” is controlled and not overstacked, supporting clarity. A few lines verge on the abstract or expository (“the sacred text of a mother,” “quiet, desperate act of love”) where a more concrete image might hit harder, but they don’t significantly blunt momentum or closure. Line-level craft is solidly strong, if not formally dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and purposeful, with images that generally do double duty for setting and emotion. Figurative language (“fear was a low-altitude emotion,” “a grand, atmospheric fresco of their life”) is apt and rarely feels strained or redundant. There is a mild tendency toward density—many sentences carry metaphors—which slightly flattens momentum but doesn’t obscure meaning or closure. No noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic glitches appear, supporting a smooth read.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and vivid but coherent figurative language (“a map of infinity etched onto a finite object,” “a living network of dawn and twilight”). Exposition is folded neatly into action—there’s little scaffolding or repetition, and almost every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. The prose occasionally edges toward lushness, but it never quite tips into purple or muddled metaphor. With a slightly leaner approach around peak beats, this would approach top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong concrete nouns (“brass fittings,” “aging canvas,” “battered book”) and clean, unforced metaphors (“endless ocean of blue,” “celestial breadcrumb trail”). Most sentences do multiple jobs—advancing plot while reinforcing mood or theme—without obvious padding or synonym loops. Figurative density is high but controlled; there are no mixed metaphors or purple stretches that blur sense. Line-level craft supports momentum right through the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is polished, with varied sentence structures, strong verb choices, and images that usually pull double duty for setting and emotion. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, rarely lapsing into mixed metaphors or true purple prose. There is little scaffolding or repetition; almost every line adds atmosphere or advances the moment. Density of ornamentation in spots keeps it from feeling entirely effortless at an elite standard.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and efficiently packed with information—most sentences do double duty for mood and plot. Figurative language is generally sharp and coherent; the opening image of dust “like rust and regret” sets a high bar the rest largely meets. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or cadence artifacts that drag momentum, though closing lines lean slightly toward summary (“a family finally pointed toward their future”). Overall, line-level craft is strong and publication-ready with only minor potential tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are precise (“pane of hush,” “filigrees of soft, golden light”) and generally do more than one job, advancing both atmosphere and emotional stakes. The prose sustains a high figurative density without devolving into muddle; metaphors are consistent with the established world-logic and rarely feel mixed. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm from becoming monotonous. At times the language flirts with purple, but it remains clear and purposeful, especially in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences are generally precise and efficient while carrying multiple loads (world-building, mood, character) without obvious repetition or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with few mixed metaphors and little sense of thesaurus-churn; phrases like “a hereditary disease” for the title or “drop of solidified night” are vivid and legible. Momentum holds through the assembly sequence, and there are no clarity slips in action order or pronoun reference. A couple of slightly ornate lines (“cynical pit of his stomach,” “graceless beauty”) skate close to purple but do not materially slow or obscure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty (character, setting, theme) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and thematically aligned—foam as polymerization, braided river as divergence—without devolving into mixed metaphors or purple overload. There are few, if any, redundant paraphrase sentences, and syntax varies enough to keep the ear engaged. At times the density of abstraction edges close to essayistic (“His need to atone was not about reversing their path…”), but it does not significantly slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush yet generally controlled; many sentences do double duty for image and concept (“a patient cartography of the void” is efficient and evocative). Rhythm varies well, and there are few if any genuine loops or padding lines. At times the language approaches purple, with stacked abstractions (“silent potential of his wares,” “glimmering parole”) that could risk density without always adding new precision, but clarity is never lost. The final explanatory sentences feel more didactic than the earlier, more imagistic lines, slightly dulling the closing image’s power.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, image-dense, and mostly avoids redundancy; many lines do double duty for atmosphere and character (“a place where he conducted his most sacred work” grounds both vocation and reverence). Metaphors are generally coherent and apt, and while the language is lush, it stops short of purple excess, maintaining clarity even at peak beats like the subsumption scene. Sentence variety and paragraphing support momentum, with no obvious scaffold phrases or synonym loops. A few metaphoric clusters (“blizzard of grief,” “anvil,” “sandpapering”) brush the edge of saturation but remain thematically unified.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structure, high information density, and generally tight integration of description, action, and interior stakes. Metaphors like “borrowed starlight” and “metallic teardrop” feel coherent and apt rather than strained, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition that slows momentum. There is a mild tendency toward lushness and reiterated concepts (“harmonious,” “bridges from silos”), but it doesn’t obscure clarity or the closure image. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive venues with only light trimming needed.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, varied in length, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting and emotion. Metaphors like “pages of stone” and “silver ink” are vivid and thematically apt, and repetition (“chaotically precise”) feels more like motif than artifact. There is some risk of over-saturation in figurative language, especially in mid-scene descriptive clusters, but it rarely muddies causality or slows momentum in a damaging way. Trimming a handful of ornate phrases would sharpen the already effective prose to a more exacting finish.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong: rhythmic, image-rich, and information-dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and motion). Some metaphor stacking and adjective heaviness nudge toward purple, but physical logic and clarity remain intact and momentum rarely stalls. There’s a small amount of redundancy in restating the mission conceptually, and the typo in “clandestineyl luminous” blemishes polish slightly. Overall, line-level craft is above average and nearly publication-ready with a light tightening pass.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is tight and purposeful: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, character, theme) with minimal redundancy, and the rhythm varies enough to sustain momentum in a contemplative piece. Figurative language is rich but not cluttered, with metaphors that stay coherent and grounded in the established sensory logic. There are no noticeable scaffolding phrases, loops, or syntactic tics that dull impact, and the opening and closing lines are especially strong. A touch more variation in sentence length at the height of the performance could sharpen propulsion even further.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is tight and purposeful, with very few redundancies or scaffold phrases; most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, character). Imagery is evocative but not excessively stacked, and metaphors (board, symphony, checkmate) are coherent and thematically aligned. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, sinuous lines and shorter emphatic beats, aiding momentum despite the contemplative mode. There is a mild tendency toward abstract intensifiers (“breathtaking structure,” “most beautiful checkmate”) that could be grounded further, but this doesn’t significantly dull clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished, with strong rhythms (“a tapestry of pinprick stars,” “a sculpted void that perfectly matched the feeling in his chest”) and high information density—most sentences advance both mood and character. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, avoiding mixed metaphors or semantic muddle. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy and no significant clarity issues. The piece flirts with lushness, but controlled variation in sentence length and concrete anchoring keep it from tipping into purple.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, multi-functional, and clear, with well-chosen metaphors (“wildflower hush,” “tide’s thought”) that suit the world. Sensory description is dense but not so overstacked as to blur meaning, and there is little to no scaffold, synonym churn, or visible loops. The prose maintains momentum even in reflective passages by tying them to concrete cues (smells, the wrapping paper, the pot). A few abstractions and reiterated ideas around “serenity” and “potential” could be pared to heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and motion) with minimal redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and coherent; images like the river peeling from its bed and droplets levitating as spheres are striking and clear. There is little obvious scaffolding or synonym-churn, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. A few phrases flirt with purple (“the core concept of this world’s vitality”) but do not materially dull the closure or obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lean but evocative, with good rhythm and a high ratio of meaningful information to words; almost every sentence advances atmosphere, concept, or plot. Figurative language is selective and strong (“wave of pure cessation,” “signal that simply turned everything off”) without tipping into purple. Expository density in the catastrophe explanation is high but remains clear, not muddy. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or line-level artifacts that sap momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong, with rhythmic variety, clean syntax, and information-dense sentences that often work on multiple sensory planes. Metaphors are mostly apt and extended with intention, and there is little paraphrase looping or scaffolding. That said, figurative density is very high—nearly every line carries a metaphor or elevated image—which occasionally feels ornamental and risks blurring precision (“certify wonder as essential,” “grey canvas of existence”). For a top-tier venue, a touch more restraint and sharper contrast between plain and lyrical moments would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level writing is generally strong, with good information density and minimal scaffolding; nearly every sentence does real work for mood, character, or theme. There is some mild purple inclination and conceptual repetition (“instrument of his failure,” “He had been a fool,” explicit restatement of the insight) that slightly dulls the sharpness of the closing realization. Syntax and grammar are clean, and the closure image is clear and undamaged by artifacts. The prose is publishable with modest tightening rather than wholesale revision.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with good rhythmic variation. Images like “holding it like honey in a jar” and “a relic from a place where physics and divinity were the same word” feel fresh and grounded. There is some stacking of high-intensity metaphors (“vortex of lucid turbulence,” “fractal of impossible angles”) that edges toward purple but rarely muddies sense or momentum. Overall density is high and purposeful, with only minor overrichness preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with clear, well-shaped sentences and a good balance between vivid imagery and forward motion. Some phrases lean on familiar formulations (“frayed nerves,” “biting wind,” “nervous rhythm of his heart”), and there is mild risk of purple prose in stacked descriptors, but it rarely impairs clarity or pace. Information density is solid: most lines do double duty in worldbuilding and character. The final paragraphs in particular are clean and resonant, with minimal scaffold or repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images precise, and there’s minimal scaffolding or synonym-churn. Figurative language (“canvas of impossible, feathery detail,” “a held world waiting for a verdict”) is vivid and mostly single-purpose, never stacking to the point of muddle. Information density is high—almost every line advances atmosphere, character, or conceptual stakes. A few abstractions (“the truest story of all”) are slightly less sharp than the surrounding concrete images but don’t materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and information-dense: most sentences do double duty for setting, emotion, and theme, and the rhythm varies smoothly. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme (threads, tapestries, stars, unraveling), avoiding mixed metaphors that would cloud meaning. There are very few redundancies or scaffolding phrases; momentum holds despite the contemplative mode. The lushness comes close to the edge of purple at times, but it never significantly obscures clarity or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is tight: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for character and world-building. Metaphors (“petrified bones of forgotten gods,” “captured twilight”) are mostly apt and not over-stacked; the prose leans lyrical without becoming opaque. There’s little obvious scaffolding or redundancy, and rhythm supports the slow, deliberate mood. A few abstract phrases (“transaction he could barely comprehend”) are less textured than the best lines, which keeps this in the strong but not flawless band.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, clear, and information-dense, with little redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language (“murmur of half-remembered dreams,” “cartographer of ghosts and echoes”) is evocative without becoming purple or confusing. Exposition about the phenomenon and the parents’ choice to “simplify a horror” is compact and well-integrated, keeping momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with strong verbs (“churning,” “bucked,” “faltered”) and images that carry multiple jobs—advancing action while deepening mood. There are few, if any, redundant sentences or scaffolding phrases, and the rhythm modulates well between calm recollection and storm urgency. A couple of lines verge on the sentimental (“a luminescent ache filled Silas’s chest,” “all the light and all the ache in the world”) but they are anchored enough in concrete context to avoid purple excess. Minor trimming of such abstract formulations would sharpen an already strong line-level performance.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences vary in rhythm, syntax is clean, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, and action at once). Imagery is vivid and largely controlled, and there are no major loops or clarity breaks. However, density of metaphor and elevated diction occasionally edge toward excess, feeling ornamental rather than pressure-driven (“symphony of chaos,” “beautiful, violent crucible,” etc.). Tightening a few of these would improve momentum and bring it closer to elite line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally avoid redundancy while advancing character and atmosphere together. Metaphors are mostly clean and thematically aligned (drum, lodestone, prism, refraction), with only slight risk of lushness tipping toward purple. There are no significant loops or scaffolding phrases that stall momentum, and the final image is clear and well-shaped. Overall, the prose bears close reading without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and economical for this mode, with many sentences doing double duty in world-building and tone (“the labyrinth below had gathered shed grief like pollen”). Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and coherent; it rarely lapses into mixed or strained metaphor. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. A few phrases (“mundane miracle,” “silent film projected from the sorrow-shard”) flirt with familiar lyricism, but they don’t materially dull momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished: sentences are clear, largely free of scaffolding, and often do double duty for atmosphere and action (e.g., the build from motes of phosphorescence to spores and dewdrops coalescing). Figurative language is rich but rarely overwrought or confusing, and there’s little redundancy or syntactic monotony. A few phrases lean toward familiar fantasy lyricism, but they don’t materially drag momentum or obscure the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, economically packed with both image and psychological nuance, and mostly avoid redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but not chaotic; metaphors (“psychic hailstorm,” “frantic bird against his ribs,” “as vast and full of silent stars”) are apt and coherent. There’s minimal synonym churn or paraphrase looping, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. A few abstractions (“emotional alchemy,” “central paradox”) flirt with slight over-explication but do not materially dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery (“moss ate the marble,” “a fossil from a forgotten age”) and generally efficient sentences that carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, theme). Rhythm varies nicely between longer lyric lines and shorter, grounding ones; there is little in the way of scaffold or paraphrase loops. A few phrases push toward abstraction (“heuristically gentle,” “creeping normality of decay”) and slightly expose the authorial hand, but they do not significantly blur clarity or momentum. Overall, line-level craft is strong enough for competitive venues, if not utterly flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally precise and musical, with strong imagery and good sentence-level variety that sustains momentum through a mostly internal/procedural scene. Some descriptive density edges toward purple (stacked metaphors and abstractions like “edge of oblivion,” “lexicon of essences,” “collapsing reality”) but remains legible and thematically aligned. There are no significant loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic artifacts that blur causality or dull the ending. Information density is high, and most lines carry more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and theme together).

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and efficient, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing action, sketching character, and maintaining atmosphere—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“tasted of brine, mildew, and secrets,” “sound of a lie tearing under pressure”) is vivid and thematically apt, rarely feeling ornamental. Syntax and paragraphing support momentum; there are no noticeable loops, filter stacks, or clarity breaks. A few lines flirt with lushness, but they remain controlled and do not blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—many sentences simultaneously advance atmosphere, worldbuilding, and character interiority. Sensory detail is vivid across taste, smell, and touch without becoming incoherent, and syntax varies enough to avoid monotony. There are a few stacked modifiers and abstract coinages (“terrestrially cosmic,” “futuristic nostalgia”) that flirt with purple but remain legible. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts impede momentum, and the final lines land with crisp, memorable imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-by-line craft is strong: sentences are varied and rhythmic, with good information density and few, if any, true redundancies. Metaphors like “auroral sorrow” and “catching the cavern’s light like a falling star” are vivid and mostly coherent, though the prose sometimes skirts the border of purple. There are no noticeable syntactic glitches, loops, or scaffolding artifacts, and the closure image is clear. A bit more restraint in figurative stacking at peak beats could elevate it further into elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and generally high in information density, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Imagery (“sweet poison on the recycled air,” “convergence of echoes”) is vivid without tipping into mixed-metaphor muddle or heavy purple prose. A few lines restate interior states a bit directly, but they do not materially drag momentum or obscure causality. The final paragraphs in particular are clean, rhythmic, and thematically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and generally efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for image and worldbuilding. Some lines flirt with purple (e.g., “a lattice of frozen light and potential sound,” “spectrum of wonder”) but the metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned rather than mixed or excessive. There is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; progression from sentence to sentence is clear and propulsive for a lyric piece. Minor density could be trimmed for even sharper momentum, yet nothing significantly muddies the climax or closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is economical given its lyric tilt, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and mechanics (“I am no longer a gardener; I am a crucible”). Figurative language is generally coherent and thematically aligned (static, chaos, crucible, jewel) without drifting into muddle. Information flow is clear; we rarely get paraphrase loops or boilerplate scaffolding that could be trimmed. There is some repetition of key terms (“static,” “chaos”) but it reads as motif rather than redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level writing is clean, fluent, and mostly economical; most sentences do at least two jobs (advancing plot, character, or atmosphere). Metaphors are largely apt and not overstacked, and there is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The prose sustains momentum through what is essentially a quiet scene, using selective detail rather than digressions. A few lines edge toward the abstract or explanatory, but they don’t significantly blunt the closing image or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures and high information density; most lines do at least two jobs (world, mood, character). Metaphors are generally apt and controlled, and repetition is minimal and purposeful. A few phrases verge on lushness, but they do not obscure clarity or slow momentum at key beats. The opening and closing images are particularly strong, giving the piece a satisfying acoustic and imagistic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory detail, varied sentence structure, and generally high information density—most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus emotion). Metaphors like “curdling from peace into a shared, held breath” and the salt chamber as “a thousand shivering stars” are vivid without tipping into incoherence. There is some lushness, but it doesn’t bog momentum or obscure cause and effect. I see no significant loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle that would dent the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and often striking at the sentence level, with many lines doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Figurative language is generally coherent and on-theme, though terms like “smoothed hush,” “placid inferno,” and “terrestrially cosmic” cluster toward a slightly purple density. There is mild redundancy in reiterating quiet/whisper motifs without adding new pressure, but clarity is never lost. Overall, line craft is strong but not yet ruthlessly pared for maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: metaphors like “grammar of groaning pipes” and the “fossilized galaxy” seal are vivid yet coherent, and most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, characterization, and mood). The rhythm varies well, with no noticeable template cadences, paraphrase loops, or over-explained beats. While imagery is dense, it rarely tips into purple; each figure tends to serve tone or theme. Minor tightening could further heighten sharpness in a few descriptive passages, but there are no artifacts that dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: imagery is vivid, rhythm varied, and most lines perform multiple functions (atmosphere, worldbuilding, emotion). Metaphors are generally coherent and aligned with the world’s lexicon (light, stars, resonance), and there’s limited redundancy or scaffold. There is some purple-leaning diction (“tragically radiant,” “deep bruise,” “defiant diamond”) and conceptual phrasing that could be pared for even sharper impact, but they don’t obscure meaning. Momentum holds throughout the scene without major loops or clotted passages.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without padding. Metaphors are precise and thematically linked (oath as line, vendetta as disease, key with no apparent lock), and they avoid muddle or mixed imagery. There is some lushness (“pearl twilight,” “aurora shimmering high above the glacial ice”) but it stays just this side of purple because it is patterned and purposeful. A bit more variation in texture—occasional plainer lines at peak stress—could sharpen propulsion further.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, imagery is mostly precise, and each paragraph carries both scene and interiority without scaffolding or obvious loops. Metaphors (“starlight pooled like liquid silver,” “a shard of glass in her heart”) are coherent and tonally unified, avoiding mixed-vehicle confusion. The density of figurative language is high but generally purposeful and doesn’t obscure causality or action. A touch of purple in places keeps it just shy of the absolute elite tier, but momentum and clarity remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: images are generally sharp, momentum is steady, and most lines perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). The prose leans lush but avoids true purple; figurative language (“broadcasting its faint, desperate signal into the collective unconscious”) is apt and rarely overstacked. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and syntax varies enough to keep the ear engaged. A few phrases skim the edge of abstraction (“carefully constructed excuse he has repeated until it almost became truth”) without adding new texture, but they don’t materially dull the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-by-line, the prose is dense and purposeful: images often do double duty for setting and theme, and there’s little scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language is consistent in register and mostly coherent—nets, webs, patterns, and looms all reinforce a single metaphorical family. A few phrases flirt with purple (“scintillatingly somber,” “beautiful weight on his soul”) but they do not obscure sense or momentum, nor do they stack to the point of overload. Sentence variety and paragraphing support a smooth read, with no noticeable loops or structural artifacts dragging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: imagery like “fine particulate of irradiated soil and cremated cities” and “light into a greasy smear” is vivid but not so dense as to obscure clarity. Exposition about physics and the stillpoint is concise and integrated into action via the letters. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic monotony, and the prose maintains momentum throughout the investigative sequence. A few abstractions (“comfortable lies,” “problem to be solved”) skim generic territory, but they don’t significantly drag the line work.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally tight and evocative, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character simultaneously). The imagery leans lush—“bruised-indigo lens,” “tasted of ozone and regret”—but avoids incoherent or mixed metaphors, and momentum is preserved despite density. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences, and syntax has healthy variation. The slight tendency toward purple does not notably obscure action or closure, so it lowers the ceiling only marginally.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) with few redundancies, and rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and sensibly yoked to sea and sound; images like “dusty fingers of gold” and “brittle tap-dance of desiccated crab legs” are vivid and concrete. There are occasional slightly over-decorated phrases and a mild risk of saturation, but they do not blur sense or closure. Momentum remains intact despite the lyric density, which is notable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong, dense, and purposeful, with most lines advancing atmosphere, world, or pressure; there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts. Figurative language is vivid and often striking (“singing of her own blood cells”), and while it edges toward purple in places, it rarely muddies literal sense. Rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum, especially as sentences shorten around the climax. The main limitation is occasional metaphorical excess that feels decorative rather than intensifying, slightly diluting impact at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: information density is high, most lines do multiple jobs, and clarity is never sacrificed despite the lyric coloration. There are a few spots of near-overwriting and conceptual redundancy (e.g., repeating the wild-animal impatience image and some stacked abstractions about revolution), but they don’t seriously drag momentum. Metaphors stay coherent and thematically aligned, and the final paragraph lands with a clean, concrete image. Tighter pruning of repeated conceptual statements about patience and revolution would sharpen this further for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with images like “places the sun never touches” and “phantom light of the lantern” doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Sentence variety and paragraphing support momentum; there are no meaningful loops, clutter, or confusing metaphors. Occasional explanatory lines about Finch’s obsession and Elias’s interpretive conclusions tell a bit more than needed but don’t stall the scene. Overall, line-level control is strong and nearly publishable as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is polished: strong verbs, varied sentence rhythms, and layered images that usually do double duty (atmosphere plus theme). Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to become purple; metaphors (storm light, cage, lockbox) are coherent and sustained. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and each paragraph advances either tension, character, or motif. A few adjectives could be trimmed, but they don’t materially blunt momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally lean yet vivid, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and character (“a precarious metal bubble… drifting on the vast, fuming acid sea”). Metaphors are mostly apt and integrated; a few phrases edge toward the ornate (“metallic sculpture of a paradox”), but they stay legible and on-tone rather than purple. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and momentum is well maintained from opening to closure. Line-level refinement could target occasional abstract nouns (“architecture,” “configuration”) in peak beats for more concrete, sensory alternatives, but overall craft is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is polished, with good information density and minimal scaffolding; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. There are a few familiar phrases (“her heart hammered against her ribs”) but they don’t dominate or blunt unique images like the “silent city of abandoned profiles.” Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and paragraphs are efficiently structured for momentum. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, avoiding purple-prose pitfalls while still giving texture.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology (“silence was a stone cast into a deep well”). Imagery is mostly apt and controlled, and there is little in the way of redundancy or scaffolding; the narrative moves forward consistently. A few phrases recur or verge on over-framed (“weighted breath,” several abstract descriptors of Kael’s role), and some diction could be trimmed for tautness. Still, there are no serious clarity issues or figurative muddles, and the final image of the shared sigh in the cold air lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and metaphors that mostly land cleanly (“clipped-off sentences of interrupted lives,” “a thousand crystalline heartbeats”). There’s a consistent rhythmic control, with longer, flowing sentences mirroring the accumulative, contemplative mode and shorter ones anchoring key realizations (“That was it. That was the sound.”). A few phrases flirt with purple (“sun bled out,” “slow, inexorable drift”), but they still serve voice and theme rather than feeling like generic ornament. There are no evident loops, scaffolding sentences, or clarity issues dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, dense with information, and often do double duty for mood and characterization without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (bus’s last growl, letter like a moth’s wing, vines as mismatched lovers) is generally precise and coherent rather than purple. There is a mild tendency toward lushness, but it rarely clogs momentum and the narrative remains clear. The sole real ding is occasional abstract diction that feels more essayistic than lived (e.g., “intersubjective”), which slightly disrupts the otherwise organic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and information-dense, with sensory and conceptual work often done in the same line (“weaving whispers into a tapestry of doubt”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent; metaphors extend rather than clash, and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences. Syntax varies naturally, and key beats are given clean, uncluttered sentences, which preserves momentum. The only notable limitation is a mild tendency toward consistent lushness, which slightly flattens dynamic contrast rather than obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are generally clean, varied, and information-dense, with imagery that does genuine work. Metaphors and motifs (arcs, spirals, vines) are coherent and sustained, not randomly mixed. There is some risk of purple prose and minor redundancy in explaining his method and aim, but it doesn’t materially blur sense or momentum. The closing paragraphs in particular carry a clear, charged image without getting bogged down in ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and controlled, with high information density and minimal scaffolding; most sentences do at least two jobs (atmosphere plus character or theme). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. There are no obvious loops or synonym churn, and rhythm supports the meditative accumulation of insight. A few formulations brush against abstraction (“vast, interconnected web of human endeavor”) but do not significantly blunt clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and figurative language that usually pulls double duty for atmosphere and theme. Images like “fog sculpture garden,” “hush of old videotapes left unwatched,” and the chalk circle dissolving are sharp and legible, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The prose flirts with being metaphor-dense, but the metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned enough that momentum doesn’t stall. Trimming one or two slightly redundant phrasings about hum/echo/entropy could make the peak beats even more cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: images like “sea of bruised clouds” and “sound of a leaf falling” are vivid without stacking into purple excess, and most sentences carry more than one load (setting, mood, or character). Rhythm varies naturally between longer, atmospheric descriptions and tighter action beats, maintaining momentum through the climax. There’s minimal redundancy and no significant scaffold or synonym loops, and the final sentence lands cleanly as a charged, precise image. A few metaphors edge toward the familiar (“diamond-dust stars”), but they don’t materially dull the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentence rhythms vary, images are mostly clean, and details often carry more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and theme). Some figurative density (“pulsing stillness,” “scent of hope,” “composition of care”) risks feeling slightly over-curated, but it stops short of true purple prose. There are no serious loops or scaffolding artifacts; each paragraph advances mood or stakes. The final sentences land with a clear, poised image, even if a few modifiers could be pared for sharper impact.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong sentence-level control and high information density; most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or concept plus character). Metaphors are coherent with the world’s texture (“cosmic hiccup,” “frayed tapestry of existence”) and don’t stack to the point of purple excess. There’s little redundancy or scaffold, and rhythm supports the contemplative mode. A few formulations edge toward ornamental, but they don’t obscure clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Metaphors are generally apt and thematically aligned, and the line-level clarity remains high even in reflective stretches. There is a slight tendency toward lushness (“compound fracture of the soul,” “cartography of his own failures”) that edges on purple in places but does not obscure meaning. I see no scaffold, loops, or technical errors that drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, information-dense, and multi-tasking (advancing atmosphere, theme, and character at once). The prose leans lush, but metaphors are coherent and on-theme, with only occasional phrases (“zephyr bloom promising a soft unfolding”) nudging towards purple without breaking clarity. Redundancy is minimal; each paragraph adds either a new sensory layer or a new emotional/coloristic turn in the glass’s transformation. Grammar, sequencing, and referents remain clean, allowing the lyric style to support rather than obscure momentum and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are vivid yet usually precise, and most lines do double duty for setting, mood, and character. Metaphors (“fragile biome,” “ghost haunting the machine”) are thematically aligned and not obviously mixed, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. The prose edges toward lush—“honeyed hush,” “protected vulnerability”—but remains controlled enough that momentum doesn’t stall. A slight trim of the densest figurative phrases could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and images that often do double duty for mood and theme. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern-consistent; it rarely feels mixed or gratuitous. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and the final paragraphs land with a precise, clean cadence. At times the prose edges toward purple, but it doesn’t materially slow momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally elegant and precise, with vivid metaphors (“last sliver of the colossal harvest moon hung like a final, luminous coin”) and strong information density per sentence. Description, action, and internal state are interwoven without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and rhythm modulates well between hush and crescendo. There is some flirtation with purple prose, but it remains controlled and does not obscure sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, character) and the rhythm supports the contemplative pressure without dragging. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or real opacity. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding sentences; information density is high and clean. A slight tendency toward purple (“bruised twilight sky,” “distant memories”) is present but doesn’t obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, strong noun/verb choices, and images that usually pull double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding (“wounded season,” “lattice of spun silver and quartz”). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful rather than ornamental, and there’s little redundancy or scaffold. A few lines risk mild purple density, yet they do not obscure clarity or flatten momentum. Line-level craft is solidly publishable with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and action) with high information density and few redundancies. The metaphorical language is lush but mostly coherent and purposeful, avoiding mixed images that would cloud the scene. Syntax and paragraphing guide momentum from stillness to the calcification sequence and back without confusion. There is some risk of purple prose, yet clarity and closure remain intact, and no obvious scaffolding or loops drag the pace.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, well-shaped, and typically carry multiple functions (character, atmosphere, and theme at once). Figurative language is selective and apt—“like trying to bottle a storm,” “an arc of profound stillness”—without piling into purple excess. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances mood or insight. The closing sentences in particular have good acoustic cadence and image density without obscuring sense.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme in the same line). Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and tonally apt; it rarely muddies clarity. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the final paragraphs in particular are tight and resonant. A few phrases lean toward elevated abstraction but do not significantly slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, precise, and multitasking (advancing action, character, and atmosphere at once). Figurative language is present but controlled, with central metaphors (circuits, currents, labyrinths, ghosts) coherent rather than piled on. There are no notable loops or scaffolding sentences, and the final images of the star chart and “resurrected dreams” land clearly without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences do multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) and the rhythm generally propels rather than stalls. Metaphors are mostly coherent and apt, and there is minimal scaffolding or repetition. However, the density of figurative language (“glacial hush,” “petrichor nostalgia,” “breathing jewel,” “architecture of his soul”) flirts with purple prose and occasionally risks drawing attention to itself over the moment. Trimming one or two stacked metaphors per paragraph would sharpen impact without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are vivid (“water… the color of a day-old bruise”), metaphors stay coherent, and most sentences pull double duty for mood and information. There are no significant loops or scaffold phrases; progression feels economical for the length. Prose density is high but rarely tips into purple, and action remains clear despite the lyric texture. A few abstract nouns (“upheaval in his soul was vast”) slightly blunt the sharpness established by earlier concrete detail, but they don’t materially harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting and theme. Metaphors (“forged in the momentary, violent union of sky and earth”) are apt and not over-mixed; the prose leans lush but stops short of purple. There are no evident synonym loops or template cadences, and the momentum, while quiet, doesn’t stall. A slight saturation of elevated language in some beats may risk over-ornamentation, but it doesn’t blur clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush, rhythmic, and largely precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and interiority (“a perfume of rust-colored chrysanthemums and fallen pear leaves plastered to the mossy ground”). Line-level control is strong, and there’s little in the way of scaffolding or redundancy that drags momentum. The main limitation is occasional drift toward purple or overtly grand phrasing (“magnificent, heartbreaking design,” “lonesome splendor”) that risks sentimentality, though it doesn’t materially obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) and the rhythm varies well between long, sinuous lines and tighter ones at moments of stress. Imagery such as “heir to nothing but rust and echoes” and the hybrid bird’s crystal-veined wings is vivid and coherent with the world’s logic. There is some density of modifiers and lyric phrasing that edges toward purple, but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or slow momentum. Repetition and scaffolding are minimal, and the final sentences land with clarity and force.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, purposeful, and information-dense, often doing double duty for character and atmosphere. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple overload; images like the coin falling into blackened soil and the red thread binding the graft are especially sharp. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the prose maintains momentum even in reflective moments. Any slight lushness reads intentional and doesn’t obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density—most sentences advance character, world, and atmosphere at once. Figurative language (“gaping, voiceless mouth,” “a heavy thing of lead and fractured color”) generally lands cleanly and suits the tone, and there are no significant loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony. A few moments verge on the ornate, but they don’t obscure sense or slow momentum, especially given the contemplative mode. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final images are precise and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong information density and multi-tasking sentences that carry image, emotion, and theme simultaneously. Rhythm varies well and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or synonym loops, despite a lyrical register. Some phrases and concepts recur a bit on-the-nose (“quiet sigh of falling petals” and the language around light/fire as resource), flirting with mild overwriting. Still, clarity is never lost, and the closure image remains sharp rather than drowned in metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, and character) without obvious scaffold or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but usually precise and non-muddled, and the rhythm moves smoothly between longer, contemplative lines and sharper, storm-timed beats. A few phrases (“thundering calm,” “sun bled across the horizon”) brush cliché or purple territory, but they don’t significantly obscure sense or blunt closure. Overall momentum is well maintained for a reflective piece.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is tightly controlled, with high information density—most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. Imagery (“shards of stone sharp enough to slice a soul,” “a dull sun in the gloom of the belfry”) is vivid and largely coherent, not stacked to the point of muddling sense. Sentence rhythm varies nicely between long, flowing meditative lines and shorter anchoring statements, maintaining momentum despite the reflective mode. There is minimal redundancy or scaffold, and grammar and sequencing remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with few redundancies, and the imagery is mostly coherent and purposeful. Occasional piled modifiers (“velveteen gloom,” “sad, lonely gleam,” “profound quiet”) flirt with purple prose but rarely obscure sense or momentum. The prose sustains atmosphere without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops, and the final images land cleanly. It’s just shy of elite because the density of figurative language sometimes slightly softens edge and urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“shard of night piercing a sky the color of milk,” “vast, terrifying oceans of what was not”) and good information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, character, and theme at once. Line-level clarity is high; the action—thinking, weighing, then writing—is never obscured by figurative language. There is mild risk of purple density in clustered metaphors and nominalizations (“cascading series of small, difficult adaptations,” “careful orchestration of change”), but they largely remain coherent and purposeful rather than ornamental. Very little scaffold or repetition appears, and the final sentence lands cleanly without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, vivid metaphor, and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Phrases like “a nook carved from stone and time” or “a lifeline” carried in outlaw songs are apt and concrete, and the syntax remains clear despite lyricism. There is some risk of purple prose and metaphor stacking (“thistled calm,” “ghost made of light,” “miniature aurora”) but it doesn’t yet obscure sense or pacing. Overall the prose feels carefully tuned and publication-ready with only light trimming.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty for mood and motion. Figurative language (“a man hollowed by a grief so vast,” “a heavy, knowing stone in her chest”) is apt and not overstacked, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. A few abstractions (“perfect, static shape,” “chaos of memory”) edge toward familiar lyricism but don’t appreciably dull clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, characterization, atmosphere) without bloat. Imagery like “sedimentary layers of muck and memory” and “a librarian in a world that had forgotten the alphabet” is vivid yet controlled, and there’s little to no synonym churn or scaffolding. Syntax and paragraphing vary in step with the emotional curve, flowing cleanly into the closure image of the velvet-lined box. A couple of near-redundant explanatory lines could be trimmed, but they don’t materially harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a high information density; most lines do double duty in atmosphere and character. Metaphors (tide, frayed rope, carving away wood) are coherent and thematically aligned without becoming overwrought. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffold; paragraphs progress cleanly without loops or filler. A few elevated phrasings (“microcosm of his life’s great struggle”) flirt with abstraction, but they do not materially slow momentum or blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, rhythm varies, and many lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). The recurring flavor imagery is inventive and mostly precise, avoiding muddle despite density. There is a mild tendency toward lushness and conceptual repetition (several sentences restate the delicacy and significance of the pruning), but it doesn’t significantly bog momentum or obscure sense. Grammar and sequencing are clear, and the closing image lands crisply.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, often doing double duty for atmosphere and information, and metaphors (storm-drinking, sun-spun glass, nectar dusk) are thematically cohesive. The prose largely avoids redundancy and scaffolding, and the riddle itself is cleanly written and evocative. There is some density of figurative language, but it stops short of purple and maintains clarity. A very light trim of explicit explanatory lines could heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and musical, with vivid metaphors that mostly avoid muddle (“streetlights daydreamed,” “shard of hush,” “tasteful grey spreading…like a fashionable contagion”). Sentences vary in length and function, maintaining momentum despite a reflective mode. There’s minor risk of purple prose, but description generally carries thematic weight rather than serving as ornament; repetition is purposeful rather than looped scaffolding. No significant syntactic or clarity issues interfere with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and most metaphors are fresh and coherent (“voice of sculpted stone and patient coral,” “captive nebula”). Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to obscure clarity, and it generally does double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each paragraph advances either pressure or reconfiguration. Minor risk of metaphor density in a few spots, but it doesn’t blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and the rhythm modulates well across setup, build, and rupture. Occasional flourish (“monument to perpetual motion,” “dissecting its ghost”) edges toward purple but stays coherent and purposeful rather than indulgent. There are no noticeable scaffold loops or template cadences, and the closure image is clear and strong. A very slight pruning of stacked abstractions in the early paragraphs could sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, varied, and often beautiful; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character (“its strokes not painting a picture but transcribing a feeling”). Rhythmically, the piece balances long, lush lines with shorter, decisive beats at key turns (the silence, then the single light). There is a mild tendency toward density of imagery that brushes purple at times, but it rarely blurs meaning or slows momentum. Line-level economy is good, with little obvious scaffolding or repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and efficient, with strong image density that usually does double duty (e.g., “rosewater dread—a beautiful, fragile existence perpetually on the verge of shattering” both atmospheric and thematic). Sentence rhythm varies, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; each paragraph advances either pressure, world, or character. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, and rarely feels purple or muddled; it holds up at the climax, where description doesn’t swamp action. A few lines are on the edge of ornament (“curated only memories”) but they remain clear and purposeful rather than indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and image-rich, with most sentences doing double-duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors like “slick, black rocks like the bones of a forgotten leviathan” and “a mechanical mantra to unlock the world’s latent radiance” are striking yet legible. There is mild risk of purple prose and conceptual stacking (“ghost of potential,” “latent radiance,” “downward pull of certainty”) but it stops short of obscuring clarity or momentum. Scaffolding and repetition are minimal, and the final paragraph lands with a strong, coherent cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and figurative language that usually does double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Images like “a frantic bird in a cage of bone” and “a sweetness that coated the back of my throat like a lie” are vivid without becoming muddled. There are minor moments of conceptual redundancy and a touch of over-explanation around how Fear feeds, but no real loops or purple-prose overload. The climax remains clear despite the metaphysical stakes, which is nontrivial at this register of lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and motion) without much redundancy, and syntax remains clear even in complex images. Metaphors are mostly coherent and thematically aligned with sound, weather, and fractals. There is some density of figurative language (“restless euphony of survival,” “fractral generating patterns”) that could edge toward excess in a more pressurized scene, but here it doesn’t obscure causality or momentum. No noticeable loops, scaffolding, or mechanical cadences drag the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is tight and purposeful: most lines carry multiple loads (world, character, mood) while maintaining clarity and forward motion. Figurative language is rich but not overstacked, with no obvious mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops dulling momentum. The rhythm varies well across paragraphs, and pivotal moments (the whistle’s crack, the world’s held breath) are given crisp, uncluttered phrasing that heightens impact. There is some density of descriptive prose, but it feels deliberate and controlled, not like ornamental purple.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, specific nouns, and a good balance between sentence variety and clarity, with images like “a final, silent syllable” and “a brick mausoleum choked with ivy” doing multiple jobs. The prose largely avoids redundancy and moves the scene forward even during description. In the central argument, stacking similar sentence structures (“A story built on nothing is a hungry thing… It starts to eat… Official records had to be altered…”) flirts with listiness but maintains clarity and rhythm. Overall, density and propulsion remain high without slipping into true purple or muddled metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt (“phantom limb of a distant storm,” “dark star”), stopping short of genuine purple prose. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; momentum carries smoothly through description and action. A few metaphors edge toward density, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is controlled and apt (the sea’s pressure vs. inner peace; “stolen heart”), never so layered that it muddies sense. Prose carries momentum even in reflective passages through well-chosen verbs and concrete detail. At times the language approaches lush, but it remains coherent and purposeful, especially at the ending cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally pull double duty for atmosphere and character without obvious padding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically unified, rarely tipping into muddle; phrases like “forlorn, heavy water he could not cup” and “luminous torment” feel earned. Syntax and paragraphing support momentum, particularly through the ascent sequence and the basilica scene. A very mild risk of purple prose in a few lines is outweighed by clarity and control, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. The figurative language is rich but mostly controlled; occasional phrases flirt with purple or clutter (“monstrous, a web of tensors and integrals…”) and there is a small bracket artifact (“[ intricately tangible a force as gravity”) that should be cleaned. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the final images land precisely.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level work is generally clean and purposeful, with strong verbs (“iris-ed open,” “vibrated through the floor”) and multi-tasking sentences that carry atmosphere and action together. There is some repetition and mild over-adjectiving (e.g., “perpetually surprised” twice, a few dense descriptive clusters), but it doesn’t seriously bog momentum or clarity. Figurative language is controlled and coherent; metaphors tend to be aligned with light, machinery, and typography in a consistent register. The prose would stand up well to publication with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is strong, often striking, and generally efficient; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is dense but not incoherent, with motifs of silence, tide, and bone tying the piece together. A few phrases verge on purple or abstract (“acidic burn of his tempered regret,” “terrifying, structured absence”), softening immediacy slightly in peak beats. Overall rhythm and clarity hold, and the final image is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and economical; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, character) without padding. Imagery is generally precise and striking, and repetition (the brass in his hand, the mist swallowing sound) functions as purposeful motif rather than loop. There is some mild lyric inflation (“furrowed hush,” “pale gaze of the waxing gibbous”) but it doesn’t tip into confusion or stall momentum. Line-level control would be publication-ready with only minor tightening of a few slightly abstract formulations.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: varied sentence rhythms, clean syntax, and images that often do double duty for mood and theme. A few metaphors lean purple or over-explicit (“life was a vessel beached at the precise moment when expectations collapse”), and there’s light conceptual redundancy around guilt and failure. Nonetheless, momentum is maintained; each paragraph adds pressure or reweights existing elements rather than stalling. No serious loops, mixed metaphors, or clarity issues impede the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally lean and purposeful, with strong images like “a shadow he couldn't see but felt in the hollow spaces between his thoughts” and the “universe of soft blue and green light” doing multiple jobs at once. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, sustaining momentum through descriptive passages and interior reflection. There is minor redundancy (“delicately robust, a fragile ecosystem… They were surviving, even flourishing”) and a few slightly purple abstract phrases (“tiny, fragile spark,” “blueprint of empathy”), but they don’t significantly bog the narrative. Line-level control is solidly publishable, though a tightening pass could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere, world-building, and emotion. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful (“the world had held its breath since the phoenix rose,” “eyes like nebulae”), and there is little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Momentum holds through the ritual despite lush description. There is a mild risk of purple prose in places, but it doesn’t materially obscure clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, dense but mostly efficient imagery, and minimal redundancy. Metaphors are generally coherent and thematically aligned (“choking beauty,” “vapor,” “sea of churning clouds”), and the rhythm supports the emotional shifts. There are moments where figurative language stacks up (“tasting of ozone and starlight,” “vista of constellations…choking beauty”), flirting with purple but stopping short of obscuring sense or momentum. With slightly leaner phrasing in one or two spots, this would be fully elite.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are generally precise and integrated (“needle thin as a whisper,” “thread of spun starlight”), and they don’t pile up to the point of purple prose. The rhythm allows the ritual to feel slow and reverent without stalling momentum. A handful of abstract terms could be sharpened into more concrete images, but they don’t materially dull the closure image or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong sentence variety and a high information density; most lines do double duty for setting and theme. Some metaphors and modifiers (“vibrant hush,” “philanthropist of moments,” “whispered suggestion”) edge toward the purple but remain coherent and pattern-consistent rather than muddled. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic tics that stall momentum, and the cause/effect chain stays clear even in the most lyrical stretches. Overall, the style is lush but controlled enough for an elite venue, though a ruthless line trim could heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, folding worldbuilding, mood, and action into single lines without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is vivid (“no louder than a falling leaf”) but not overstacked, and most sentences carry multiple jobs (tone, setting, character) efficiently. There are no major clarity issues or syntactic artifacts; momentum is maintained despite the quiet action. A few phrases verge on the ornate, yet they don’t obscure meaning or blur key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most carry multiple functions (world-building, character, and tension) without padding. Imagery like “a thimbleful of night that warped the air around it” is vivid yet legible, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. The prose does flirt with purple in a couple of spots (“silent, unending caress,” “glass y sheet of annihilation”), but these don’t obscure causality or climax. Overall, momentum and clarity are well maintained despite the density.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple payloads (image, mood, and character) with minimal scaffolding, and rhythm alternates between long, sinuous lines and sharper hits like the “sharp ping.” Extended metaphors (the dome as skull, the storm as his inner hurricane, the vigil as darkroom) are coherent and sustained rather than mixed. There is minor risk of saturation in phrases like “cartography of scars” and “rarefy the past,” but context keeps them intelligible. Very little feels redundant or expository; each paragraph advances both mood and situation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for action and atmosphere. The figurative language is frequent but mostly purposeful and coherent, and the choreography of his movements around the sundial remains comprehensible. There is some risk of over-embellishment (“every moment was a proposition to be tested,” “a whirlwind of dignified chaos”) that edges toward purple in places, but it doesn’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. The prose could be tightened slightly to heighten urgency, yet it already meets a high standard.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with high information density: many sentences simultaneously build world, character, and theme (“His work was slow, a meticulous sorting of the salvageable from the lost, a penance he’d begun years ago.”). Figurative language is vivid but mostly controlled; images like “sliver of bone” and “cathedral of decay” feel organic to Silas’s mind rather than grafted on. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony; the piece reads cleanly aloud. A few lines skirt the edge of purple, but they don’t obscure sense or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, syntactically varied, and dense with purposeful metaphor—“each note a drop of silvered sorrow,” “a brute-force attack on the laws of this place”—which largely carries both atmosphere and information. However, the figurative density is high across almost every sentence, edging toward overwriting under the rubric even though clarity remains intact. There is little scaffolding or repetition; most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) efficiently. The final image is sharp and legible, though a slight trimming of metaphorical flourish in mid-scene would heighten propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and dense without becoming opaque, with images like “sky-plume blossoms frothed in a riot of impossible blues” and “a cartographer mapping a landscape that remade itself with every glance” doing multiple jobs at once. Sentence rhythm varies, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned, so it doesn’t feel like purple excess. A hair more restraint at one or two moments of metaphor-stacking could sharpen impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences vary in rhythm, description is controlled, and nearly every line earns its place by advancing mood, world, or interiority. Figurative language is frequent but mostly clear and coherent, and there are few to no true scaffold or paraphrase loops. The main limitation for elite venues is that the density of metaphor occasionally feels slightly overdetermined (“sky was a vast canvas of cerulean regret,” “color of unspoken apologies”), risking uniform tone rather than modulation. Still, clarity and momentum are maintained throughout, and the closing cadence lands cleanly.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the imagery is often vivid ("splintered cypress," "fossilized on a plastic canvas"), the central observation beat relies on a stack of filter verbs ("He could see," "He watched," "He saw"), which creates unnecessary distance during the story's most visual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative ("ghost-heat"), but slips into cliché ("hummed with a secret energy") and occasional ambiguity ("luminous glass artist"—is the artist luminous, or the glass?).

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally evocative, but the climax suffers from rhetorical parallelisms ("not erased but softened... not banished but reshaped") that stall momentum. The ending leans on summary ("She had done it") where concrete detail would have maintained the scene's power.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from cliché ("weariness etched deeper than the lines") and stacked abstract metaphors ("spiderweb of despair") that tell emotion rather than evoking it. While mechanically sound, the writing relies on familiar adjective-noun pairings that reduce the vividness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is functional but marred by clichés ("stole the air from Elara’s lungs") and overwrought phrasing ("monochrome of want"). Information density is low due to the reliance on broad summary transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vivid imagery anchors the abstraction, though the text leans heavily on metaphor (&quot;drowned thing,&quot; &quot;pilgrim of sparks&quot;) which occasionally crowds the prose; information density is otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is weighed down by heavy modification and abstract noun-stacking ("retrocognitively trapped," "cacophony of collapsing moments"). These stylistic artifacts and forced phrase insertions obstruct the narrative flow and reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose suffers from repetitive metaphors (using "symphony" three times to describe the mechanism) and occasional cliché ("belied her shackle," "spasmed to life"). Phrasing often prioritizes dramatic effect over precision ("spewed forth a hurricane"), creating a layer of artifact that distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with high information density. There are minor artifacts of overwriting (adjective-heavy phrases like "stark, violent-grey glare") and some cliché phrasings ("screaming a discordant chorus," "cleaving in two"). The pacing is good, though the final paragraph's shift to clinical language ("cellular structure") jars slightly against the established poetic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished but suffers from high adjective density and cliché phrasings like "honeyed light" and "eddied and coalesced." The description often prioritizes ornamentation over momentum, slowing the pacing of the heist.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from adjective stacking and cliché constructions ("symphony of twisting metal," "crystalline prison"). The phrase "thoughtfully spirited grace" is particularly clunky, acting as a label rather than a description of motion.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is functional and readable but marred by cliché phrases ("shattered my life," "wiping the slate clean") and overwrought emotional descriptors. The pacing is steady, though the logic dumps regarding the cipher slow the momentum at a critical juncture.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    While rhythmically competent, the prose suffers from filter-verb stacking in key beats (paragraph 4) and relies on telling ("His motivation was...") to convey information that should be dramatized. The imagery is strong but occasionally verges on ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is economical and rhythmic, matching the robotic POV. "Achingly familiar" is a minor cliché that slightly dulls the introduction of the central object, but the description of the "gentle unfurling" is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally high, with standout imagery like the "key with teeth of broken birds' wings." However, standard metaphorical phrasing ("thaw the frost," "silence had become a fortress") occasionally flattens the texture. The prose flows well but density varies.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("web of fine fractures"). However, the score is capped by reliance on stock phrases ("smile that never met her eyes") and adverbial telling ("wisely pragmatic way") that dilute the line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically assured, with high information density and no significant artifacts. Phrasing like "mapped with fine white scars" and "cradle, holding not one life, but multitudes" demonstrates strong control over imagery and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.9)
    While the prose has momentum, it is weighed down by stock metaphors and adjectival clutter ("dance like wraiths," "velvet darkness," "unshed tear"). These clichés reduce the immediacy of the imagery, making the writing feel decorative rather than precise.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm and sensory imagery are strong, though the opening paragraph suffers from metaphor density ("heavier than snowpack," "crisp... light," "auroral sorrow" in quick succession). The prose tightens effectively in the back half, delivering a clean, high-impact climax.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong imagery (the valve, the tunnel) is undercut by scaffolding sentences ("My method was unorthodox," "My motivation... was to"). These declarative explanations stall momentum and violate the show-don't-tell principle expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is evocative and density is high, with strong imagery like "ink bleeding into water" and "symphony of seawater." The phrasing is polished, avoiding scaffold artifacts and keeping the sensory experience immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is overwritten, relying heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("strange, ethereal twilight," "impossible, breathtaking beauty") and similes ("unhurried as the slow crawl"). These "purple" tendencies and filter verbs ("He was trying to guide") clutter the line level and distance the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong phrasing like "thread-of-gold fire" and "commiting it all to the quiet." Minor clichés like "dust-moted light" and "maw" appear but do not significantly detract from the overall high quality and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with good information density. There is a slight tendency toward adjective stacking ("tiny, gleaming disk," "small, white paper slip"), but the imagery is generally sharp and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally competent and dense, but occasionally overwrought with phrases like "chiasmus of perception" and "sonic tapestry," which border on purple. While there are no mechanical errors, the reliance on slightly academic or stock metaphors in high-pressure beats distracts from the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.5)
    Imagery is vivid ("needle stitching the dark sky"), but the text suffers from high metaphor density that blurs the literal action ("reverse-engineering a soul," "strings of causality"). Occasional clichés like "lead weight" and "guttered out" detract from the otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("like a fallen star"). Line-level craft is solid, though a high density of abstract nouns occasionally slows the momentum, and the "darkening brightness" oxymoron feels slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from adjective-noun density ("worn leather boots," "gray fog," "clumsy void," "vibrant past") that slows momentum. Phrasing occasionally drifts into redundancy ("audibly muted") or overwriting ("meticulously crafted ghost").

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and maintains a steady rhythm. There are a few slightly worn phrases ("prickling on his neck," "chilling clarity," "bastion of solitude") that dampen the freshness of the line-level work, preventing a higher score. However, the density of information is good, and the pacing supports the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    While generally competent, the prose relies on clichés ("heart a frantic drum") and abstractions ("ineffably soft," "agonizing slowness") that dull the impact. The final paragraph over-explains the emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished but suffers from expository scaffolding and telling. Phrases like "an expression of his ethically playful nature" and "His singular motivation... was to discover" explain what should be shown, flattening the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.0)
    Imagery is dense and evocative ("rust-colored skeletons," "jagged teeth"), establishing a strong mood. However, the prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("She felt," "She recalled," "She knew"), which distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally lush and evocative, with high information density. However, the integration of the phrase "as the transformation completes" creates a jarring tense error (present tense "completes" vs. narrative past "took") that disrupts the line-level logic. Otherwise, the writing is polished and free of scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose leans heavily on sentimental clichés ("soft as sea mist," "tears... transforming it into something brilliant"). Emotional beats are conveyed through stock physical markers ("tears welled") rather than fresh, specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is rhythmic but marred by "telling" artifacts like "boldly sympathetic" and the repetition of the precious phrase "luminescent ache." The specific, tactile description of the weaving process is the strongest line-level work, contrasting with clichéd descriptions elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("faceted carapace," "three-beat waltz") that supports the tone. The writing maintains good density and momentum, though some phrasing in the climax leans toward the abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and lyrical, though it occasionally relies on abstractions ("topography," "vector") that distance the reader from the physical action. Rhythm and imagery are generally strong, with no significant scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but dense with adjective-noun pairings ("practiced silence," "profound gloom," "desperate energy") that slow momentum. Filter verbs ("He saw," "He felt") appear frequently in the climax, distancing the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from frequent modifier doubling ("slow, deliberate," "precise, controlled," "familiar, frustrating") which reduces density. The "not like lightning, but like..." construction is a slightly worn rhetorical device.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery, but marred by repetitive diction (the word "familiar" appears four times) and noticeable adverb clusters ("startlingly close," "impossibly tangled," "violently and silently"). These artifacts slightly dilute the otherwise high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the anaphora in the climax ("She saw... And she saw...") creates rhythm, the pervasive filtering ("She tried to scry," "Lyra felt") throughout the text creates a "telling" drag. The prose is polished but lacks the density and immediacy required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally polished with good attention to sound and texture ("slurry of sand," "beaded on his oilskin"). However, there is a reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("massive marble blocks," "complex cylinder," "panicked breath") that creates a predictable rhythm and slows momentum in the first half.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally functional but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("trembling certainty" appears twice verbatim) and some "telling" modifiers ("analytically artistic"). The passive construction in the middle ("were forming arrows") slightly drags momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally polished, but marred by the clumsy insertion of the prompt phrase ("courageously kind hands"), which triggers a repetitive explanation ("kind to her memory, kind to this wild hope") that reads as scaffolding. Some adjectival clutter weakens the density.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and flows well, with high information density. There is some unnecessary filtering ("He could feel," "He sat") that distances the reader, and "escondite" distracts slightly as a thesaurus-like insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by a pervasive adjective-noun rhythm ("hushed whisper," "glittering lies," "predatory stillness," "swirling anxiety"). This formulaic modification reduces momentum and makes the texture feel manufactured rather than observed.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished but suffers from frequent adjective-noun pairing ("quiet, desperate hunger," "frantic, spidery charts") and filter verbs ("She knew," "She believed"). The phrase "incandescent restraint" reads as a slightly strained abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm and imagery are generally strong, particularly in descriptions of the port. However, occasional reliance on abstract modifiers like "impossible softness" or "intricate and painful beauty" leans toward overwriting, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("grand tomb for forgotten questions"). The use of "suddenly" to trigger the climax is a minor pacing shortcut, but the surrounding description remains high-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("rust and finality," "chaotic symphony") that maintains momentum. The line-level craft is solid, though occasionally reliant on adjective-noun pairings to explain internal states ("orderly calm," "hopeful desperation").

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Imagery is vivid, but the prose suffers from adjective stacking and abstract phrasing ("palpable, vibrating stillness," "purposefully curious ache"). These overwrought descriptors distance the reader from the immediate physical experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    While readable, the prose relies on several stock phrases ("seen their last sunrise," "precision of a surgeon") that dull the impact. Adjective-noun pairings like "heartfelt artisan" and "magnetic calm" tell rather than show, weakening the line-level density.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is high-density and evocative, particularly in the extended metaphor of the ice capillaries and arteries. Phrasing like "speck of sharp-eyed judgment" is sharp, though "joke told by the universe" leans slightly towards cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lyrical and polished ("sculptor of echoes"), establishing a strong rhythm. There are occasional lapses into filter verbs ("he saw," "he felt") and slightly clunky exposition ("This tool was not for any bell..."), but the overall density is good.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose has momentum but suffers from a density of clichés ("liquid midnight," "maelstrom of sensation," "crushing silence") and filter verbs ("I felt... tasted... heard") during the climax. Several sentences in the high-pressure beat rely on a repetitive "I [verb]" structure that flattens the rhythm rather than accelerating it.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally evocative, but a glaring verbatim repetition loop occurs in the third paragraph ("left ajar for decades" appears in two consecutive sentences). This artifact suggests a lack of proofreading and triggers the artifact penalty, preventing the story from reaching the highest bands globally.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is weighed down by excessive adjective-noun pairings ("profound silence," "lonely cloud," "impossible vibrancy") that tell rather than show. A significant jarring repetition occurs with "ghost bride began to ghost," and the reliance on abstract modifiers dilutes the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("captured sky"), but suffers from the clunky summary transition ("Weeks turned to months") and the forced insertion of the required phrase "orchid solace," which clashes with the established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.3)
    Phrasing relies on redundancies ("bleached-white") and abstract labels ("cautious enchantment," "profound hollowness") that tell rather than show. The line "attack the earth with shovels" is a cliché, and the prose generally prioritizes poetic signaling over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is competent but overwrought with adjective-heavy phrasing ("monoliths of silent gold," "holographic ghosts," "ephemeral data streams"). While the rhythm is smooth, the density of modifiers and "this was [X]" constructions slows momentum and distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is functional but relies on several clichés ("settled deep into the bones," "heart-stopping moment," "screamed with silence") that lower the literary ceiling. The "system lag" beat is a stock thriller device that feels mechanical rather than earned by the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjectival clutter and "tell-y" metaphors ("fierce tenderness," "sorrowful currents"). The simile "air was as thick as an unsent letter’s ink" prioritizes thematic signaling over sensory logic. The rhythm is consistent, though the density sometimes slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm, though it occasionally tips into purple territory ("syntax of ceasefires"). The specific prompt-phrase "lotus-hearted ache" reads as a clunky, forced metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally polished but relies on scaffold sentences ("His motivation was simple," "This was the canvas," "His action was complete") that halt momentum. Figurative language is dense and occasionally draws attention to itself over the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose flows with good momentum but suffers from specific artifacts, including the tautology "orchestrating an orchestra" and the repetition of "bewitch." Some descriptions rely on generic adjectives ("shimmering," "intricate") where sharper verbs would improve density.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    A significant repetition artifact occurs with the phrase "converging chaos" appearing twice in close proximity. Dialogue often serves as clunky exposition ("We’ve spliced it with a parasitic chronophage fungus") rather than natural speech, slowing momentum at the critical juncture.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from high density of "adjective-noun" pairings ("impossible color," "crystallized despair," "phantom limb") and mixed metaphors (photosynthesis/soil/sun blended with shell/wind). While rhythmically competent, the heavy reliance on abstract figurative language ("metabolize sorrow into stanzas") creates opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose has a deliberate rhythm but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("single," "foxglove regret") and purple descriptors ("toxic sadness") that tell rather than show the emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from a density of stock images and clichés ("dust motes danced," "cathedral-quiet," "heart-stopping second," "mask of guarded pain"). While the rhythm is functional, the reliance on these familiar descriptors and purple phrasing ("luminous harmony") weakens the specific impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished with strong sensory imagery, particularly regarding the stone and machinery. However, some phrasing leans toward melodrama ("love so profound it ached") or tells the emotion directly, slightly diminishing the impact of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the prose is generally polished, several clichés mar the emotional peaks ("Panic seized him," "smile the first ray of sun"). The line "The storm outside was nothing to the one that had raged inside him" is a melodramatic summary that tells rather than shows. These artifacts detract from an otherwise well-crafted surface.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally functional and rhythmic, but the integration of required phrases creates noticeable drag. Specifically, the phrase "analyzing the grain in wooden furniture" reads as a mechanical insertion that disrupts the sentence's syntax, momentarily breaking the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and cliché ("palpable force field," "sharp edges of grief"). Frequent use of abstract nouns and filter verbs ("he watched," "he felt") distances the reader from the physical immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and flows well, with strong imagery ("crystalline vines," "dying candle"). There are no significant artifacts or loops, though the adjective density in the opening description slightly slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.5)
    The middle section suffers from repetitive sentence structures ("He walked...", "He placed...", "He approached...", "He dropped..."), which creates a monotonous rhythm during the active setup phase. While the imagery is often clear, this syntactic scaffolding drags on the momentum. The prose is functional but lacks the rhythmic variety expected at a higher level.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished with good rhythm, though it leans on abstract descriptors ("unseen currents," "cosmic void"). The repetition of "obsidian grace" as a bookend feels forced, and reliance on filter verbs ("He felt," "He watched") softens the immediacy of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is polished but suffers from explanatory scaffolding ("He was a reflective man," "It was a lesson in interference"). The use of high-concept phrasing ("noctilucent reckonings," "grammar of the world") sometimes obscures the physical reality of the scene, creating a density that feels manufactured rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought ("permanent tributary," "velvet black"). The integration of required phrases ("hard softness," "reflecting deeply") feels mechanical, creating abstract or clunky constructions that disrupt the sentence-level logic.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished with good density and rhythm. There are occasional lapses into "telling" through heavy adjectival stacks ("staggeringly complex idea," "lucidly watchful") and oxymorons ("serene upheaval") that teeter on purple, but the mechanics of the tide and pattern are described with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose flows smoothly but suffers from "purple" descriptors and clichés ("blackened maw," "sunbeam lancing," "miraculously preserved"). Phrases like "fantastically complex" serve as empty intensifiers that lower the information density.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is technically polished but suffers from abstract purple phrasing ("liquid rainbows," "pure potential") and adjectival padding. There is a tendency to "tell" the magic's effect rather than letting it emerge through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is marred by a high density of clichés and stock metaphors ("cracked like a shattered promise," "masks of granite," "velvet sky," "palpable force"). These artifacts act as scaffolding that obscures the scene's immediacy and weakens the literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and evocative but suffers from a density of adjective-noun pairings ("mineral ghost," "crystalline expanse," "spidery fissure-line") that occasionally slows momentum. The reliance on expository blocks to establish character history ("amoral philanthropist," "ruthless pragmatism") tells rather than shows, distancing the reader slightly from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and high metaphor density ("posture a stanza," "harvest of echoes," "frozen tears") that obscures clarity. The reliance on adjective-heavy description and abstract phrasing stalls momentum and results in a cloying texture.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and purposeful, with strong imagery ("pale, limbless bodies," "vivisectionist of the soul"). However, it occasionally slips into cliché ("fluid grace," "hollow-eyed") or overwriting ("clarity of a perfectly rendered ideogram"). These moments slightly dull the otherwise sharp impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished but suffers from lexical repetition and ornamental density. The phrase "blushing stillness" appears in both the opening and closing paragraphs, reading more as a looped artifact than a resonant refrain, and terms like "cadence" and "rhythm" are overused to enforce the musical metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is competent but marred by clichés ("sanctum held its breath," "hours bled") and the forced, repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor"). These artifacts disrupt immersion and flatten the line-level texture.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and high-density, with strong imagery ("texture like a moth's wing"). There is a slight tendency toward adjectival heaviness ("chilling certainty," "impossibly close") that occasionally slows the rhythm, but the line-level craft generally supports the ethereal tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and atmospheric ("clawed at the violet sky"), but it leans heavily on adjectival density ("gossamer structure," "nascent light"). Some phrasings feel ornamental, prioritizing poetic effect over kinetic immediacy, which slows the pacing during the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is the story's strength, featuring evocative lines like "brass tarnished by ages it had never chronologically experienced." The rhythm is controlled and the imagery is often striking ("phantom pressure of a hand"). A few moments drift into overwriting ("writhe in sympathetic agony"), but line-level craft is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally strong but stumbles at the emotional peak with the phrase "jewel of salt and sorrow and triumph," which relies on abstract labeling rather than concrete imagery. "Bruised twilight" is a slightly worn descriptor.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally evocative ("glowing, open mouth," "living architecture"), but marred by a few clichés and tells. Phrasing like "wave of accidental wisdom washed over him" is passive, and "endearingly feisty" serves as an adverb-heavy tell rather than a dramatized trait.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative ("droplets clinging to his eyelashes like miniature nebulae"), maintaining a strong rhythm. There is a slight tendency toward adjectival density ("sole and perpetually bewildered," "frantic, beautiful chaos"), but the imagery is generally precise and supports the surreal atmosphere without becoming purple.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose suffers from filtering and telling, notably the paragraph opener "Being carefully resourceful," which labels a trait rather than showing it. Weak modifiers like "impossibly vast" and "dire warning" dilute the impact. The rhythm is generally smooth but lacks density in the summarized sections.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong imagery ("watercolor paintings left in the rain") clashes with academic/meta diction ("narrative sensation") and abstract telling ("timeframe was accelerating"). These artifacts distance the reader during peak emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and dense, utilizing evocative phrasing like "braid of what-ifs" and "meticulous act of translation" to elevate the action. Rhythm is smooth, though a few phrases (e.g., "warmly methodical curiosity") feel slightly like inserted prompt artifacts rather than organic descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose has good rhythm but suffers from adjective stacking ("faintly, miserably, pulsing") and slightly purple phrasing ("cartography of silence"). These artifacts reduce immediacy and create a layer of description that sits on top of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and readable, with moments of strong imagery ("thistle seed taking root"). However, it relies on several well-worn tropes and phrases ("bruised twilight," "infinite dark," "broken rainbow") that prevent the line-level craft from feeling fresh. The information density is adequate, but the reliance on filter verbs and abstract descriptors limits the immediacy of the peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. Some phrasing leans toward the purple or clichéd ("bridge of reason over the chasm of the unknown"), but the descriptions of the storm and the crystals are evocative. The technical terminology ("calibrated rod," "summer-quill") is integrated naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("seeds of light") and good momentum. Minor filter verbs ("he realized," "he felt") and some adjective stacking slightly reduce immediacy during the epiphany sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density. There is a slight over-reliance on similes in the climax ("like the scent of salt," "like the cracking of the shell"), but the line-level craft generally supports the story's introspective weight without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally competent but suffers from passive scaffolding ("world had been built," "was a bunker builder") and standard metaphors ("tendril unfurling," "swirling chaos"). The phrase "intangibly tangible" is an oxymoronic artifact that weakens the line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjective density ("placid Aether," "immense calm," "fluidly logical") and frequent filtering ("Elian registered her presence"). The repetition of "vaulting hush" works as a refrain, but some descriptions border on purple, prioritizing decoration over momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery, though occasionally over-reliant on adjective-noun pairings ("liquid light," "digital ether"). The phrase "wisely adventurous" stands out as a clunky, unmotivated insertion that disrupts the otherwise smooth narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose has strong rhythm but relies on several genre clichés ("white-hot rage," "breath and an eternity") and abstract descriptors ("loaded emptiness"). These artifacts dull the impact of otherwise sharp imagery like the "precise application of fire."

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative, with strong sensory anchoring. However, pivotal moments rely on slightly worn imagery ("heart of a star," "silver platter") and abstract phrasing ("screwing the thread of tangible reality") that creates distance at the peak of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjectival density and visible clichés ("danced like ghosts," "yawn of evening"). The reliance on abstract descriptors ("novel lightness," "eloquent sound") blunts the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and atmospheric, successfully carrying the "alchemical" tone with high density and strong rhythm. Occasional filter verbs (e.g., "he felt," "he found") slightly distance the reader in what could be more immediate visceral moments.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.2)
    Multiple stock phrases ("heavy blanket," "gentle precision of a surgeon," "crackled in protest") degrade the literary quality. While the sentence rhythm is functional, these clichés prevent the prose from reaching publishable density.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, particularly in the "puddle map" sequence. However, the text is marred by clichés ("ghost in their machine," "sigh of corrosion") and some purple metaphors that distance the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong imagery ("breath pluming," "stone teeth") is undercut by abstract phrasing ("profound sense," "quietly vivid") and adjective clusters. Some "telling" of emotions stalls momentum, particularly in the denouement.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from adjective stacking ("impossibly small moonstone cabochon dust speck") that hurts rhythm. The repetition of the phrase "mossy delight" feels forced and draws attention to itself as an artifact. Imagery is vivid but sometimes decorative rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, but the text relies on a few clichés ("patient focus of a surgeon") and oxymorons ("uncertainly certain," "breathlessly alive") that feel slightly manufactured. The description of the water-constellations is high-quality, but the final paragraph's abstract summary drags the energy down.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from moments of clunky exposition ("Alchemy was a factually mystical science") and adjective-heavy phrasing ("gray, insistent light"). The density is good, but the telling of the magic system rules slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is competent but relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings to convey emotion ("modestly fearless acceptance," "spectral confession") instead of concrete action. Prompt phrases are inserted as labels rather than dissolved into the scene's reality, creating a slight "paint-by-numbers" feel.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is functional but suffers from "purple" tendencies and abstract metaphors ("symphony of self-knowledge," "liquid intensity") that reduce clarity. There is a reliance on adjective-noun pairings that slows the momentum of the physical action. The line-level craft is competent but draws too much attention to its own construction.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished with some strong imagery ("skeletal hull"), but relies on telling over showing for internal states ("my own intuition anchored and absolute"). There are moments of "purple" description ("whisper-thin map") that border on ornamental, and some cliché phrasing ("bruised purple sky").

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally competent with some vivid technical specificity ("hoist cables," "mainspring barrel"), but is marred by cliché phrasing ("silence crashed down," "heart a steady, slow drum"). The phrasing "jolt... of pure information" is a functional shortcut that flattens the texture of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and lyrical but leans toward abstraction and heavy adjectival phrasing ("silent shattering of concept before form," "sigils of paradox"). While the imagery is often beautiful, the density of abstract nouns in the climax reduces concrete visualization.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is rhythmic and evocative, with strong imagery ("sliver of frozen light"). However, the text suffers from a density of adjective-noun pairings ("hushed archives," "dusty debating halls," "sterile data") that occasionally slows momentum and feels ornamental rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished but adjective-heavy ("tiny, milky-white shard," "ancient, honest light"), creating a slightly slow rhythm. Some imagery is abstract ("symphony of cosmic repair") or slightly clunky ("slick and corroded like old metal"), but the overall clarity is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density ("Summer asphalt after a cloudburst"). Minor reliance on standard descriptors ("bewildering maze," "unwavering certainty") and some expository telling preventing a higher score, but the craft is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mechanically sound, but suffers from adjective-heavy description and mixed metaphors ("keened... like a turbine-hum reverie"). The prose density sometimes slows momentum during what should be high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but leans toward the "purple" side ("patient pilgrimage," "umbral tenderness"), occasionally prizing sound over precision. There is a tendency to "tell" emotional states through labels ("profound... tenderness") rather than showing them through action or sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and evocative, particularly in the description of the lagoon. However, the opening relies slightly on passive construction and stacked modifiers ("gentle hum... constant... placid vibration"), creating a momentary drag on momentum that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is held back by a high density of stock metaphors and clichés ("tired sigh of the tide," "heavy cloak," "crucible of his own mind," "magnum opus"). While grammatically clean, these artifacts flatten the imagery and prevent the writing from achieving the freshness required for the highest echelon of literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is evocative and propulsive, though occasionally dense with modifier stacks (e.g., "fragile, paper-thin wax cylinder phonograph shaving" drags slightly). However, images like "brittle as desiccated leaves" and "diamond stylus tracing a silent groove" are sharp and effective. The rhythm generally supports the building dread.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished with high information density. Occasional abstract phrases like "storm of collapsing potential" slightly dilute the impact of the stronger concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is functional and clear but suffers from cliché modifiers ("angry red," "ferocious power") and filter words ("satisfying switch"). The writing tells the reader how to feel about the storm rather than evoking the sensory reality through fresher language.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwriting and abstract adjective-noun pairings ("surprising, overwhelming glory," "resonant peace"). These abstract descriptors dilute the physical immediacy of the climax, favoring poetic assertion over concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.6)
    Momentum is stalled by adjectival clutter and abstract "telling" constructions ("tranquilly perceptive study of her sorrowful mime"). Several prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly ("through contextual clues"), creating clunky mechanical bridges that disrupt the literary texture.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is excellent, with high information density and strong rhythm. Imagery is evocative ("metallic wound," "warped into silence"). The prose flows smoothly with no visible artifacts or scaffolding, maintaining a polished, literary tone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from relentless adjective-noun pairing ("cobalt lagoon," "melancholic sigh," "burnished hush," "perfect shard"), creating a plodding rhythm. Phrases like "clean, simple pain" and "perfect question mark" read as clichés or abstractions that dull the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but reliant on stock phrasing ("world held its breath," "days bled into weeks") and some adjective-heavy clusters ("silent, synchronous exhalation"). These artifacts dull the specificity of the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with sensory information ("worry a small, familiar weight," "bronze quiet"). The imagery supports the themes without drifting into purple prose, and the pacing accelerates appropriately as Aris approaches the center of the tower.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally evocative but suffers from scaffold sentences that summarize rather than show ("The air was a contradiction," "His motivation was simple"). Some phrasing leans toward adjectival density ("spiny spheres, feathered wisps") that slows momentum without adding necessary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative, with strong imagery. However, forced phrasing to accommodate prompt elements (e.g., "intuitively descriptive question mark") and some stock expressions ("disappointment soured in her throat") detract from the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished but leans on filter structures ("She saw," "She caught a glimpse") that dilute immediacy. Some phrasing feels performative ("physical weight," "echoed silence") rather than precise.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from clichés ("silence of a falling snowflake," "voices that were not wind") and oxymoronic telling ("cautious abandon") in place of showing. Adjective stacking and adverbial telling dilutes the impact of the stronger images.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmically strong, with visceral imagery like "memories... tasted like ash." While the opening phrase "nomadic penumbra" leans slightly purple, the line-level craft is generally disciplined and serves the atmosphere well.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but relies on familiar phrasings ("disappointment felt like a physical weight," "thunder in her chest") and abstract telling ("It was the method... the key"). The reliance on "felt like" similes dilutes the immediacy of the sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by a tautology ("petrified stone"), synonym pairing ("messy, chaotic"), and telling ("simple and agonizing"). Some metaphors ("chaff of his suffocating guilt") feel slightly dense and overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from filter adjectives ("sad, knowing") and telling. The inserted poem uses a simplistic rhyme scheme that feels slightly underweight for the narrative importance placed upon it.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from expository scaffolding ("My motivation was a simple, desperate thing," "My work was not to... but to..."). These "tell" sentences flatten the immediacy of the ritual. Occasionally, phrasing leans into cliché ("surge born of love") or adjective-heaviness ("screaming green tumult").

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the prose is generally polished, significant lexical repetition undermines the descriptive quality. The word "impossible" appears three times ("impossible green," "impossible blue," "impossibly clear") and "perfect" appears three times, signaling a lack of variation in key descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.8)
    Heavy reliance on stacked modifiers ('ragged roar,' 'blustering force,' 'predawn bruise') creates a purple, melodramatic texture. The prose frequently tells emotional states through oxymorons ('gentle scream') rather than showing them through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished but occasionally overwritten ("grinding stars") or clunky ("patina bronze censer foot" is a noun pileup repeated twice). The phrase "settled long after the hydraulics fail" creates a tense friction (fail vs. failed) or reads as an uncapitalized proper noun.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished but relies on a few stock phrases ("sheets of rain," "bastion against chaos") and over-explained metaphors ("Every gust... was a physical echo of his own internal state"). These moments of telling rather than showing slightly blunt the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished and readable with some strong imagery ("man made of absences"). However, reliance on clichés for transitions ("Weeks bled into a month") and some worn metaphors ("metronome for his thoughts") keeps the craft in the functional rather than exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong image-based writing ("crinkle of old paper," "blind white flowers"). The rhythm supports the pacing well. Minor artifact: the phrase "liquid clock ticking away his chance" leans slightly toward cliché, but the overall line-level craft is high.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marred by distinct repetitive artifacts: the phrases "lacy menace" and "softly commanding" both appear twice in a short text, reading as unpolished loops. High adjective density borders on overwriting in places.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though it occasionally relies on abstract descriptors ("academic rhythm," "directed spontaneity") rather than concrete imagery. There is a repetitive reliance on the word "perfect" (perfect laboratory, perfect spiral, perfect improvisation) that creates a minor lexical loop. The "scientifically romantic" tag tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, but filter verbs and passive constructions ("I saw," "I could feel," "The memory that came was") distance the reader during key sensory moments. The final paragraph relies on explanatory sentences that slow the momentum generated by the flight scene.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though it occasionally leans into heavy metaphor density ("grief so old it had become part of his bone structure," "thin as spun glass"). While evocative, these flourishes sometimes draw attention to the writing rather than the scene. The "recalibrated the universe" line is borderline hyperbolic but works in context.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery like the "glittering lattice." Minor melodramatic phrasing ("finally, finally") is the only noticeable artifact in an otherwise clean execution.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.1)
    Competent momentum, but marred by significant clichés ("held breath," "gravel wrapped in silk"). Abstract nouns ("desperation," "forgiveness," "acceptance") often replace concrete imagery in pivotal emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a density of abstractions ("resounding hush," "profound and layered silence") that verges on overwriting. The phrasing is often "wanderingly exact" in a way that feels stylistically heavy-handed. While clear, the reliance on telling over showing flattens the immediate impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("water sighing," "thinner than thought"). A few modifiers lean toward the generic or hyperbolic ("awesome power," "impossibly perfect"), which slightly mars the otherwise high-definition imagery. The technical descriptions blend well with the lyrical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is competent and dense, but marred by stock phrases ("familiar strangers," "quiet wildfire," "damp earth") and reliance on metaphor over concrete action in key beats. The rhythm is steady but lacks variation during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and readable but relies on standard imagery ("steel veins," "warm, gentle glow") and telling over showing ("residue of boredom"). The phrasing is functional but lacks the freshness or density required for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally smooth but relies on some stock pairings ("damp earth and ozone") and slightly purple phrasing ("fingers that were now dust"). The phrase "semantic engineer" reads as a tell that flattens the mystery of his work.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and metaphor abuse ("shelves breathed," "hours bled"). Frequent "X of Y" abstract constructions ("covenant of love," "ghost of the image") clutter the sentences and distance the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is high-density and evocative, propelling the narrative without scaffold or drag. Phrasing like "landed with the soft thud of moss on brick" creates immediate textural grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from metaphorical density that borders on "purple" (e.g., "dialects of dampness and decay," "sang with the memory of minerals"). While technically clean, the reliance on abstract metaphorical framing ("language of growth," "language of deep roots") creates a filter between the reader and the action. There are no major mechanical errors.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is functional but marred by a repetitive [Adjective, Adjective Noun] cadence ("gentle, persistent warping," "simple, stark, and all-consuming," "frantic, delicate dance"). These artifacts create a rhythmic monotony that dulls the impact of otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("quietly charismatic grace," "deep, sorrowful quiet") and stock metaphors in the climax ("cello's mournful cry," "choir's gentle rise"). Telling often replaces showing ("Elian’s singular motivation was..."), and the "security guard" anecdote serves to explain rather than dramatize his presence.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally functional but marred by several clichés and mixed metaphors in peak beats. Phrases like "resolve as hard as diamond" and "volcanic eruption" lack freshness, and the final image mixes metaphors confusingly ("tenderness... bedrock... fire").

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, effectively mirroring the musical content of the plot. However, a reliance on dense adjectival phrasing and frequent similes ("like metallic flora," "like a soul," "sharp as the dawn") creates a slightly decorative texture that softens the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is competent and rhythmic but relies on stock phrasing ("practiced economy of motion," "sickly green tendrils") that dulls impact. The simile "loud and hollow as the container" feels slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with some striking images ("gleaming like wet ink"). However, adjectival stacking ("perfect, dark mirror") and the awkward integration of prompt phrases ("spiralingly calm") create minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished but suffers from metaphor congestion (e.g., "delicate seam in time," "weight of the past," "lightness of prophecy" all in one sentence). The reliance on abstract nouns to describe emotions ("unspoken gasp," "burgeoning curiosity") creates distance. Rhythm is generally good, but the "forests of second thoughts" metaphor stack is dense.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from "adjective-noun" overload and mixed metaphors ("fluid economy... belied the splintered wood"). Key emotional beats are filtered through abstract nouns ("fortress of practicality") rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is rhythmically competent but relies heavily on stock metaphors and clichés (e.g., "island in a sea of noise," "rare gem," "monstrous, uncaring heart," "placid lake"). These artifacts dull the literary impact and prevent the imagery from feeling truly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("paraphrasing the tectonic shift") that obscure the physical reality of the action. While images like "lantern-moth hush" are evocative, the density of abstraction occasionally stalls narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("breath a quiet metronome"), though it occasionally leans into adjectival phrasing ("shimmering failures," "searing heart"). The sentence-level craft is solid, but the density of descriptors sometimes slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose suffers from weak intensifiers and "telling" artifacts ("breathtakingly beautiful," "impossibly complex") that flatten the imagery. The awkward, oxymoronic phrase "powerfully gentle" is repeated twice, reading as a forced insertion rather than a natural description. Adverb-heavy phrasing ("stubbornly silent") further dilutes the sentence-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose leans on stock phrasing ("ghost haunting her own skin," "tears of fire") and abstract intensifiers ("impossible, vibrant") rather than concrete particulars. Persistent filter verbs clutter the observation and distance the reader from the sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, though phrases like "rain fell in sheets" are standard. The reliance on summary during the card reading lowers the scene's immediate density.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    Syntax is fluid, but the prose suffers from adjective stacking ("profound silence," "weary light," "flimsy barrier") and stock phrasing ("ripple in the pond of reality"). Metaphorical density occasionally obscures rather than sharpens the image.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, maintaining good momentum. However, a few phrases lean into cliché or purple description ("poisonous vine strangling a perfect rose," "mask of a smile") which detracts from the otherwise sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose has a pleasing rhythm but suffers from metaphor density and overwriting ("crucible for this difficult alchemy," "silent, swirling ghost"). These flourishes occasionally clog the narrative momentum and draw attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and evocative, though density is high; metaphors shift rapidly from "archipelago/sea" to "tunneling/soil," which slightly muddles the visual logic. The repetition of "meteor hush" works as a refrain but risks feeling like a prompt-check. Rhythm and momentum are otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from abstract, overwrought phrasing ("tasted of... regret," "fractured time," "hushed thunder") that obscures sensory clarity. The reliance on telling ("She saw it happen") instead of showing the mechanism of the magic reduces the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from metaphorical density that occasionally obscures the image ("silent symphony," "ghostly fire"). There is a reliance on telling ("ecstatic clarity") where concrete imagery would have carried more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and image-dense ("filament of captured light," "sinking into the hum"). The rhythm supports the meditative tone effectively. While slightly adjective-heavy in the opening ("soft, internal luminescence"), the descriptions are functional and vivid, creating a strong sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rich in imagery ("filigree of brass," "symphony of immense complexity"), establishing a strong atmospheric density. Line-level craft is generally strong, though the reliance on abstract nouns in the climax slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and high modifier density ("purple ink bleeding," "silent, final fraying," "hollow ache"). Frequent use of "like" and "as" similes filters the experience ("like the sigh," "like the edge"), and the final paragraph leans on abstract summary over concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high-impact phrasing like "muffled percussion" and "low-voltage accusation" that creates a distinct texture. There are no loops or scaffold artifacts; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. The imagery is consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished and distinct, with strong imagery ("phantom river," "falling silk"), though it occasionally relies on clichés ("belied his true nature," "heartbeats of the cosmos"). The rhythm is smooth, but the density of adjective-noun pairings slows the pace, contributing to the feeling of a tableau rather than an active scene.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is functional but marred by somatic clichés ("breath caught," "trembling fingers," "understanding dawning in his weary eyes") that flatten emotional beats. Metaphors are mixed in quality—"phantom limb" lands well, but "sun bled into the horizon" is tired.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by frequent adjective pairings ("deep, dormant," "pure, focused," "single, unwavering") and oxymorons ("thunderous serenity") that feel ornamental. These artifacts slow the momentum and reduce the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is descriptive and rhythmically sound, with high information density. However, abstract phrasing in key moments ("nascent destiny held in stasis," "miracle of her defiance") dilutes the immediacy of the physical action, leaning on telling over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally strong with high sensory density ("grit of soil," "hum of surf"). However, the use of "somatic markers"—a diagnostic label—during the peak tension beat creates a slight filter artifact, and the phrase "People said she was..." relies on passive telling.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally competent but marred by a specific repetition artifact: the distinctive phrase "luminescent ache" appears identically in paragraphs 4 and 7. Phrasing occasionally relies on familiar descriptors ("silent witnesses," "tasted like failure"), reducing freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is functional but marred by significant clichés like "blade's sharp edge" and the tired "slow-motion ballet of destruction," which sap the energy from key images. "Logic banks could not process" is a stock genre phrase that flattens the drone's alien nature into a stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose relies on clichés like "ghost in the machine," "automaton's purpose," and "dangerous liaison." Adjective-heavy telling ("placid ignorance," "purest form") reduces the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mechanically sound with high density, but the prose suffers from interpretive filtering and occasional overwriting. Phrases like "silence so complete it felt etched" and "coffin for a future" layer metaphor over action to the point of distancing the reader. The reliance on explaining the emotional weight of gestures ("act of profound negation") slightly dulls the impact of the gestures themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose leans into purple territory with phrases like "feral lullaby," "velvet dark," and "somnambulist’s waltz," which feel like adjectival padding rather than precise observation. Phrasing like "His unique attribute was a strange one" is clunky telling. The density of modifiers slows the pacing without always adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong sensory details ("dark and veined like old blood") and rhythmic control. Phrasing like "tiny, constant satellites of sorrow" demonstrates a high level of craft without drifting into purple prose. The pacing of the dialogue matches the logical deconstruction, accelerating appropriately toward the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative ("needle a whisper"), but suffers from occasional stock imagery ("thin as a moth's wing") and abstract telling ("dissonance of old guilt made manifest").

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is overwritten, characterized by a density of adjectives and adverbs ("strange and pervasive emergent hush," "small, iridescent whispering gallery tile flake") that clogs the rhythm. Metaphors are frequent but sometimes strained ("paragraph of loss," "chapter of fear"), and the tendency to stack modifiers reduces the impact of the stronger, more concrete images.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative, but heavily reliant on "telling" via exposition to convey significance ("It was not a simple christening," "Kaelen believed memory was a tyrant"). This explanatory scaffolding distances the reader from the immediate action in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("tasted like silver and honey"), but occasional stock similes ("shattered like cheap glass") and slightly purple phrasing ("mystic orchard garden") dampen the line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally high-quality with strong imagery ("red light a lone star"). A few minor repetitions ("small red light... small sliver") and a high density of figurative language in the middle section prevent a higher score, but the rhythm effectively mimics the movement of the light painting.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("slow, tectonic joy"), with good information density. However, reliance on phrases like "symphony of sensations" and "impossibly complex" leans on generic descriptors at peak moments where specific imagery would have carried more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished, but the phrase "source code of their fate" is a jarring register clash (tech metaphor in fantasy) that breaks immersion. Some filtering ("He saw how") flattens the immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is functional but marred by "writerly" overwriting and clichés. Phrases like "purpose that felt sharp enough to cut glass" and "ghost in the silver hush" feel decorative rather than precise. Expository interiority ("The motivation was a quiet ache...") tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is competent but suffers from adjective-heavy descriptions ("soupy white," "feeble holes") and "telling" constructions ("to distill complexity into essence") that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but relies on several stock literary clichés ("world held its breath," "marrow of his bones," "ghost of what it had been"). These artifacts reduce the freshness of the imagery despite high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mechanics are clean and rhythm is controlled, but the prose suffers from some stock pairings ("focus of a surgeon and the patience of a gardener") and adjectival padding ("wistfully pragmatic," "perpetual darkness"). The description of the bitting gauge is the strongest textual moment; other imagery feels safer and less distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is generally functional, but the exact phrase "atomically reflective" appears three times in a short text, creating a distracting repetitive artifact. This repetition breaks the immersive flow and highlights the artificiality of the prompt usage.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished with high information density. Some imagery leans toward the conventional ("tiny, clear jewels") or hyperbole ("exploded into a thousand fractured rainbows"), but the line-level craft is generally solid.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("chaotic ocean of paper"). However, the reliance on cliché somatic markers ("knot of dread," "heart hammering") and occasional adjectival clutter ("clever, insidious things") holds back the line-level score.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose suffers from purple phrasing ("suffocating intent," "profound spatial mutiny") and worn clichés ("velvet of dust," "panic... lanced"). These artifacts dull the immediacy of the danger and obscure the action.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric but occasionally leans into "writerly" overwriting ("exhaled," "meticulously," "deliberate precision"). The climax relies on diagnostic labeling ("sudden, piercing clarity," "profound, structural understanding") to convey the epiphany, which dulls the immediacy of the action itself.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.5)
    Repetitive phrasing ("spongey dread" appears three times; "nervous confidence" twice) clutters the prose and dulls the imagery's impact within a short word count. The writing frequently leans on filter verbs ("He felt," "He saw") and standard clichés ("standing on a cliff edge") that distance the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    Imagery is vivid ("resinous scent," "wet-plate collodion"), but the integration of required phrases creates minor drag; "dynamically observant" reads as a scaffolded tell. The prose is otherwise dense and propulsive, effectively conveying the visual noise of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally polished but slips into cliché and "purple" phrasing (e.g., "voice soft as dust motes in a sunbeam," "sun bled from the sky"). These stylistic flourishes occasionally distract from the otherwise solid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.8)
    Line-level craft is hampered by a high density of clichés ("fragile as a moth’s wing," "swirling chaos," "settled deep in his bones," "ocean of time"). While the rhythm is functional, these stock images dilute the impact of the more original concepts like the stellar grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft is functional but marred by significant clichés ("silent scream," "obsidian glass") and abstract phrasing ("psychic noise") that dilute density. The prose tends to summarize the magic's effect rather than rendering it through concrete, immediate sensory data.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    While functional and descriptive, the prose suffers from metaphor density and some clichés ("cartography of her pain," "flicker to a flame," "shattered the world's clock"). The reliance on adjective-heavy abstraction ("storm of nightmare static") reduces line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong and rhythmic ("You could not punch a hole. He had to fill it"), but occasionally veers into melodrama with phrases like "stained with soil and sorrow." The verbatim repetition of "fiercely gentle" is a significant artifact that mars the polish. The density of information is high, avoiding unnecessary scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("ozone crackle," "insulating emotionally with facts"). However, a few moments of overwriting appear, such as the adjective-adverb stack "absurdly monumental" and the slightly purple "fortress of facts." These minor artifacts detract slightly from the otherwise high density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("prayer expressed through precision"), though it occasionally drifts into abstraction or purple phrasing ("still, deep well of sorrow"). The writing is dense and clear, but the reliance on explanatory sentences in the climax softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally polished and atmospheric ("soft, metallic chime," "crystalline patterns"). There are occasional lapses into clunky phrasing ("gears of thought loosening like a relaxing fist") and some heavy-handed telling ("became the catalyst"), but the line-level density is high and imagery is specific.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally competent but suffers from repetitive word choice in the climax ("impossible luminescence," "impossible harmony"; "screamed at him," "screamed louder"). The "microscopic/gloved finger" error is a notable line-level logic flaw that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is competent with good rhythm, but suffers from some stock imagery ("shroud of ivy," "spiderwebs"). Filter verbs and slightly purple phrasing ("river's memory," "chronicle written in silt") distance the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.8)
    "Smelling of ozone and regret" is a weak, abstract sensory opening; later phrases like "dying star" and "manuscript of a broken heart" feel clichéd. Prose density is generally good, but the register occasionally clashes ("haptic tremor").

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and evocative ("chorus of leafy ghosts"), but marred by occasional redundancies ("shock jolted") and filtering. Some descriptions lean toward the generic ("impossible beauty," "hands trembling slightly"), preventing the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "purple" overwriting ("radiant hush," "cosmic veils," "ghost-scent"). The reliance on abstract adjective-noun pairings creates a barrier to immediacy and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clean with some strong verb choices like "scallop," though it suffers from adjective-heavy phrasing ("shattering betrayal"). The line-level craft is competent but safe, avoiding risks that might generate higher energy or density.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    High-quality imagery ("surrendered its ghost of heat," "scripture he’d... forgotten") establishes a strong mood. A few stock phrases ("tell-tale sign," "dawn bled purple") slightly mar the otherwise fresh prose texture.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by diagnostic telling ("her core motivation laid bare") and some clichéd phrasing ("weight of a library"). The pacing of the trance sequence is handled well.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong imagery ("footstep a drumroll") creates density, though some phrases ("sun bled," "quiet fire") lean on cliché. The prose has good rhythm but occasionally drifts into abstraction during key moments of action.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished with strong imagery ("skeletal remains," "spells sputtered") and good rhythm. There are minor instances of telling over showing, but the line-level craft generally supports the tone well without distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with good information density. However, the required phrase "meteor hush" is integrated awkwardly ("profound meteor hush"), disrupting the otherwise smooth description of the sensory shift underwater.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("bruised light," "screaming physics") with excellent rhythm. "Uncoin the void" is a standout phrase that elevates the closure image, though "cast lots decision maker" is a slightly clunky noun phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is evocative but relies on a high density of standard metaphors ("creases like fault lines," "shoreless sea," "hollowed out"). While "apricot and violet" is a visually specific pairing, it borders on stock imagery in this context. The rhythm is good, but the reliance on adjectival clusters reduces the impact of the stronger images like the "copper-ribbed skeleton."

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally evocative but leans into abstraction ("cosmic imbalance," "symphony of the world," "impossible moisture") where concrete grounding would be stronger. Some metaphors, like "dawn bled," feel like "writerly" artifacts rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mechanically clean, but the prose relies on stock metaphors and clichés at critical moments ("force of a tidal wave," "stain on a good man's name," "weave the frayed threads"). These artifacts reduce the impact of the emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is rhythmically sound and polished but relies on clichés ("dew-kissed," "impossible delicacy") and heavy modification. The density of "purple" descriptors slows momentum and distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythmic variety and high information density. A few clichés ("silent scream," "roaring deafness") detract from otherwise sharp imagery like the "matte-grey" buckle and "hair-thin ring."

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but relies on stock phrasing ("mask of serene disapproval," "smooth as a river stone") that dulls the otherwise creative imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but weighed down by frequent adjective-noun pairings ("storm-born silence," "curated peace," "resonant curiosity") that create a static, heavy rhythm. The density of modifiers occasionally obstructs the narrative flow and feels overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally evocative, particularly "spectral fingers, more memory than matter." However, the required term "macerate" creates a semantic clash (implying liquid softening rather than dry shredding), and the full title "leaf blower symphony conductor" interrupts the rhythm slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally evocative, with strong imagery like "statues weeping icy tears." However, specific required phrases like "dimensionally homesick" and "make friends with uncertainty" jar against the high-fantasy tone, reading as register breaks or prompt artifacts rather than organic thought. These moments disrupt the otherwise smooth lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.9)
    A critical tense error at the climax ("penny drops" in a past-tense narrative) disrupts the pivotal moment. The prose suffers from adjectival bloating ("newfound, solemn clarity") and purple phrasing ("twilight bled purple").

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is rhythmic and functional but relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("chaotic waterfall," "swollen pearl," "familiar despair") that feel ornamental. The phrase "serenely electric" is a slightly jarring register clash that functions more as a label than a precise sensory evocation.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is readable but marred by "writerly" artifacts and purple descriptions ("symphony of static," "woven from solidified moonlight"). Sentence structures are functional but often pad the word count with adjectives rather than advancing the action through strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but relies heavily on expository telling ("This was his life's work," "His motivation was singular") to establish stakes. There is a tendency toward adjective stacking ("glistening sinew thread," "faint, internal light") that slows momentum, though the "bruised lavender" image creates a nice visual pop.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong image systems ("phosphorescent barnacles"). A tendency toward abstract descriptors in the climax ("shimmering pathway," "unfolded horizons") prevents the imagery from reaching the highest tier of specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density ("sliver of time wedged," "reeling hush," "staccato of fear," "paper-thin map"). These frequent, decorative figurative flourishes obscure the action and create a "purple" texture that violates the economy bias of the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from repetitive vocabulary ("impossible," "shimmer," "hush") and reliance on stock phrasing ("panic, cold and sharp"). While some imagery is vivid, the line-level execution lacks the precision required for the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm is strong, particularly with the recurring heartbeat motif that anchors the prose. The writing is polished but suffers from slight adjectival clutter in the middle section that drags on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and sensory imagery ("skin, mapped with... copper veins"). Deductions apply for a few clichés ("held its breath") and "telling" attributes ("quietly articulate") rather than demonstrating them, but the overall texture is high-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and image-rich, particularly in the description of the transformation ("sharp edges softening like wax"). There is a slight tendency toward adjective stacking ("placid, unnerving", "profound, sickening") and stock phrases ("bone-white") that dampens the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwriting and adjective stuffing ("perfect, translucent ghost," "irresistible, growing strength"). Authorial intrusions like "The action was not of violence, but of reclamation" disrupt the immersion, explaining the scene's significance rather than letting the action show it.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    Imagery is evocative but the prose leans purple ("twilight bled," "staining the clouds," "fading bruise"); the phrase "brittle hush" is repeated verbatim, creating a noticeable artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and evocative ("weightless click"), but occasionally leans into overwriting with adjective-heavy descriptions ("frantic, beautiful symphony"). There is some reliance on filter verbs ("He saw," "He decided") and abstract phrasing ("interpret silence as possibility") that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose is polished, it relies too heavily on adjectives and clichés ("blissfully unaware," "breathtaking moment," "frayed like memories"). The repetition of "impossibly" (vast, soft) and "soft" (footfalls, shimmer) dulls the precision. The writing tells rather than shows in key moments ("equations rhymed"), reducing the immediacy of the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is overwritten, heavily relying on abstract noun-stacking and "purple" artifacts ("hush of improbable beginnings," "syllable of light") that blur imagery. Adjectives frequently do the work that strong verbs and specific nouns should handle, reducing the text's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is polished but heavily reliant on clichés ("velvet curtain," "spun glass," "study in grief") and filter verbs ("He felt," "He knew"). These artifacts distance the reader and reduce the immediacy of the magical operation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is functional but marred by clichés ("stole his breath," "force of a tidal wave") and modifier stacking ("maddeningly vague," "pale, ghostly"). These artifacts dilute the density and prevent the writing from feeling fresh or immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, with high information density. A few phrases lean toward cliché ("calluses on the soul," "map of her own soul"), which slightly dulls the otherwise sharp imagery of fractures and chisels.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive artifacts, most notably four variations of "shimmer" within a short space, alongside repeated uses of "pulse" and "wonder." Heavy adjective stacking ("tender green shoot," "rich, dark soil") slows the rhythm and reduces information density.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    While competent, the prose suffers from overwriting and heavy modification ("shattered into a thousand trembling shards," "silent scream"). These stylistic flourishes obscure the action's immediacy. Several filter verbs ("I sensed," "I murmured") distance the POV unnecessarily.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is polished and readable, with moments of strong imagery ("spider-scratch of ink"). However, it occasionally drifts into purple phrasing ("physical wound in the landscape of knowledge") and abstract metaphor that distances the reader. The mechanics are sound, but the density of adjectives and "told" emotions slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative, with good rhythmic control. Occasional lapses into slightly purple phrasing ("spectral sentinels," "sigh of displaced water") and telling ("frantic, elegant script") detract slightly from the otherwise high density.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.3)
    While information density is high, the prose is weighed down by adverb-adjective stacks ("driftingly alert calm") and melodramatic intensifiers ("monumentally complex," "prick at Elian's throat"). These artifacts weaken the immediacy of the action and lend a slightly overwrought tint to the craft.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally competent but relies on summary at the pivotal moment ("the magic happened") which dulls the impact. Additionally, the transition scaffold is repetitive ("The elevator chimed" appears twice to mark beats), and the "photons/schematic" diction creates a texture mismatch.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("cartography of their life," "dry rustle"). The line-level craft supports the story's meditative pacing without stalling momentum. A few phrasings lean slightly toward the adjective-heavy ("breathtaking," "profound"), but the overall texture is distinct and professional.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, though the opening paragraph relies on stock imagery ("silence was a physical weight," "city held its breath"). The phrase "fractally precise" appears twice in close proximity, creating a minor repetitive artifact. However, later descriptions of the "living network of dawn" and the tactile lock-picking process are sharp and original.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is functional but marred by significant clichés in peak moments ("struck him with the force of a lightning strike," "chaotic ballet"), which trigger artifact penalties. These stock phrases flatten the emotional impact of the realization and disrupt the otherwise competent line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong and propulsive. There is a slight metaphor clash between the "driftwood/water-smoothed" imagery and the "frozen/cloud" setting, which feels like a forced integration of the required tone element rather than organic imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought ("symphony of desperation," "rust and regret"), relying on adjectival density. The rhythm is competent, though the summary of the climactic climb feels rushed and lacks sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and adjective stacking ("silent, shimmering decay," "soft, golden light"). Mixed metaphors ("surgery on the soul of history") and cliché pairings ("beautifully flawed") reduce clarity and impact. High density of abstract phrasing obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally capable with good density, but slips into overwriting at the climax. Phrases like "filigree of impending doom" are purple, and "subsonic frequency... screamed" creates a contradictory sensory metaphor that muddles the technical logic of the device.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished but relies on several familiar literary phrasings ("tight, hard knot," "slow, widening dawn") that dampen freshness. While rhythm is controlled, the reliance on abstract summary for the emotional realization reduces information density.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is competent but leans into "purple" description ("virginal surface," "liquid silver," "captured whisper") that reduces density. The prompt phrase "mindfully scattered" appears as a clunky modifier that disrupts the sentence's logic. The "He understood now" construction acts as a scaffold for the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory language is evocative, but the prose occasionally suffers from metaphor congestion ("voice a shovel," "hands like grinding stones," "touch was the anvil") and adverb stacking in peak beats ("impossibly, terrifyingly smooth"). The repetition of the "sandpaper" metaphor dulls its impact by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose relies heavily on adjectives and "telling," with prompt phrases ("vigorous and tender," "empathetically decisive") inserted awkwardly. The mixture of C++ syntax in the dialogue tag is a jarring stylistic choice that disrupts the flow. There is a tendency toward purple phrasing ("perfect, metallic teardrop") that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the imagery is evocative, the prose suffers from a noticeable repetition artifact: the distinctive phrase "chaotically precise" appears in both paragraph 2 and paragraph 6. Some phrasing leans toward purple ("tone of the cavern was a quaking reverie"), slightly slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose has a generally smooth rhythm but suffers from frequent adjective stacking ("solid, reliable," "complex, shimmering," "cold and sharp"). A visible typo ("clandestineyl") disrupts the polish. The density is good, but the reliance on modifier pairs creates a repetitive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose rhythm is generally smooth with strong imagery ("filigree of stress cracks," "texture without melody"). Deductions apply for occasional abstract telling and the slightly forced insertion of required phrases that disrupts the lyrical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose rhythm is smooth, but suffers from modifier bloat ("thoughtfully precise," "profound stillness," "perfect, interlocking"). The phrase "tear traced a path" is a cliché artifact that mars the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose flows with good rhythm and density, but the imagery suffers from noticeable clichés ("ozone and old paper," "velvet fabric," "chrysanthemums" for fireworks). These stock phrases undermine the "highest echelon" aspiration, making the descriptive work feel competent rather than singular.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    While sensory descriptions are vivid ("wet-fur scent"), specific word choices mar the execution. "Journalize" is jarring, and "olfactorily sensitive" is clunky; "turning of the tide's thought" borders on mixed metaphor. These artifacts distract from otherwise strong density and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose has momentum but suffers from logical slips, such as silence being "broken only by the sight" of leaves (mixing auditory and visual metaphors confusingly). There is a tendency to "tell" emotional states and use stock intensifiers ("impossible speed," "soundless noise") rather than concrete observation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally sharp, with strong sensory opening lines ("tasted of salt and rust"), but the climatic explanation is a dense block of exposition that halts narrative momentum. This "tell" section flattens the story's peak into a forensic report rather than a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is often overwrought ("oscillating repose," "sculpted hush that had form"), and bureaucratic phrasing ("certify wonder") clashes with the mythic setting. Adjective density slows the rhythm without adding narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally functional but marred by the awkward repetition of the phrase "avalanchingly quiet" within a short space, which reads as a forced artifact. Abstract descriptors ("immense and sorrowful curiosity") occasionally displace concrete imagery, reducing line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "purple" tendencies ("catching the last light... like honey," "precise echo of the ticking cosmos"). Clichés like "silence was deafening" and "silhouette of grief" detract from the otherwise high-concept imagery, lowering the score for line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is functional but marred by cliché phrasing ("breath plumed," "testament to," "frayed nerves") and adjective padding ("impossibly delicate," "ethereal, exposed stage"). These artifacts slow momentum and reduce the density of the description.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("canvas of impossible, feathery detail"), driving momentum effectively. The description of the sheared bolt provides a sharp, arresting image that anchors the climax, though some phrasing ("screaming the memory") leans slightly melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is weighed down by modifier congestion ("perfect globe," "tiny, defiant star") and abstract phrasing ("raveling silence"). The required element "stoically sparkling" is an awkward anthropomorphism that creates a jarring semantic clash in the description.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sensory density is high, with lines like "soured the fruit and grayed the leaves" grounding the fantasy. However, abstract phrases like "worked not with iron, but with hope" and the blocky exposition of motivation/attributes read as scaffolding, slightly marring the otherwise polished prose.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("acridly organic"). A few phrases in the mid-section, such as "universal language for imminent catastrophe" and "crushing weight," lean slightly on abstraction or cliché where specific sensory mapping would have been sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is competent and polished but relies on adjective-heavy telling ("absolute, terrifying darkness," "oppressive quiet"). The phrase "luminescent ache" feels tonally jarring and abstract, disrupting the otherwise physical grounding of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and cliché ("manic grin," "symphony of chaos," "piercing a cosmos"). The insertion of the technical term "total internal reflection" clashes tonally with the surrounding high-fantasy register.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished but dense with modifiers and metaphorical weight ("silent detonation," "impossible sky"). While rhythmically competent, the reliance on adjective-heavy description slows momentum and occasionally feels overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("sluiced," "coalesce"), though it occasionally relies on abstract labelling ("crystallized despair") rather than concrete embodiment. The description of the "sorrow-meter" feels slightly mechanical and clunky compared to the lyrical quality of the rest.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is technically clean and rhythmic but heavily reliant on stock metaphors ("seeds in barren soil," "graveyard of her thoughts"). While imagery is frequent, it often feels decorative rather than serving a specific causal or emotional pressure, reducing the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.0)
    Line-level craft is hampered by clichés ("heart a frantic bird," "lead... into gold") and abstract telling. The prose often describes emotions ("profound and gentle sorrow") rather than evoking them through specific imagery or action.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("unyielding crust," "creeping normality"), with strong rhythmic control. Minor reliance on abstract labels ("heuristically gentle") prevents a higher score, but the visual and tactile imagery is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished and readable but relies too heavily on adjective-adverb pairings ("gently meticulous," "piercingly clear," "singular, sorrowful") that violate the show-don't-tell principle. These artifacts smooth over the texture, preventing the visceral sharpness required for the highest literary bands.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose has momentum, it suffers from significant artifacts, including the jarring insertion of the prompt phrase and several clichés ("landed fish," "chips of obsidian"). The opening metaphor ("tasted of... secrets") leans toward overwrought purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("personal shroud of drizzle," "cacophony on her palate") and good rhythmic control. The writing effectively balances the scientific and the mythic without lapsing into purple prose, maintaining high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally high-quality with strong density ("charcoal-fingered delicacy"). However, there is a tendency toward adjectival stacking ("profound, aching beauty") that slightly slows the rhythm in reflective moments.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but relies on stock phrasing ("sweet poison," "breathtaking rush," "strange hope bloomed") that dulls the impact. While clear, the sentence structure during the montage section becomes repetitive, lacking the propulsive rhythm needed for a discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is functional but marred by cliché ("frozen tears") and abstract phrasing ("uniform grey of knowing") that creates distance. The phrase "literally costing the ice its form" is a significant artifact, using a clunky modifier that breaks the immersive, mythic spell of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose has strong rhythm and moments of vivid clarity, but the climax relies too heavily on stock modifiers and clichés ("screaming crescendo," "strokes of blood-red," "intense, hungry light"). These abstract descriptors reduce the impact of the otherwise tactile imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.4)
    Scaffold sentences ("The action he chose was simply to hear") tell rather than show the process. The prose relies on some clichés ("breadcrumb," "fabric of the community") and occasionally dense but clunky metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished with good information density and flow. While efficient, some imagery relies on standard similes ("like a snowflake," "spider spins its web") that slightly dampen the otherwise unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally functional but marred by overwriting and weak modifiers. Phrases like "fluctuates mysteriously" tell rather than show, and "curdling from peace into a shared, held breath" is a mixed metaphor that confuses the imagery. The "storm of sensation" in the climax is a cliché that misses an opportunity for specific sensory texture.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is rhythmically smooth but suffers from "adjective-itis" and heavy reliance on abstract metaphors ("folded from starlight and prayer") over concrete action. Repeated oxymorons ("tranquil blaze," "placid inferno") and standard simile scaffolds ("Just as a cartographer charts...") create a texture that feels manufactured rather than observed.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished but leans toward purple ("silhouette stitched from twilight," "celestial chalk marks"). The verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "patiently nimble" for two different nouns draws attention to itself as an artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is functional but dense with "writing workshop" clichés ("deep bruise," "defiant diamond") and abstract telling. A specific redundancy appears with "sibilant hiss" (tautology), and the reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("ghostly resolve," "curated peace") slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and evocative but leans toward overwriting ("congenital disease," "comma of liberation"). The phrase "wisely enduring" is inserted clumsily as an adverb-adjective pair that tells rather than shows the character's state.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.3)
    Prose is functional but saturated with clichés ("single tear traced a path," "shard of glass in her heart"). Abstract phrasing often replaces concrete imagery, and the forced integration of prompt terms results in jarring register clashes.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic with high readability, though it occasionally relies on overwrought phrasing ("walls weep history," "human eclipse") that feels decorative. Line-level momentum is generally good, but the "show-don't-tell" balance tips toward telling in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished with a smooth rhythm, and the description of the tea whisk is tactile and precise. However, reliance on abstract or stock phrases ("weight on his soul," "language he longed to understand") and the awkward required adjectives dampens the line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("steel spine," "paper confetti") and good rhythmic control. The writing is efficient and avoids scaffolding, maintaining a high standard of line-level craft throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery, though it suffers from occasional "purple" modifiers ("bruised-indigo lens"). Information density is good, but the climax relies on summary descriptions of the map's contents rather than concrete details of the "alien" constellations.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished but leans heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("murky gloom," "dusty fingers") and stock phrasing ("sweet sorrow"). While images like "brittle tap-dance" land well, the density of modifiers occasionally drags the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    The climax suffers from rhythmic redundancy and synonym churn ("enveloped, integrated, and neutralized"; "cleansing, its forgiveness, its utter nullification"). These triple-beat artifacts stall momentum at the peak of action.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished with good density. A few stock metaphors ("wild animal clawing," "heart skipping a beat") dilute the otherwise specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong rhythm and precise imagery (e.g., "clean prints in the damp silt"). The writing avoids scaffolding artifacts, delivering information and sensory data with density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong specific imagery ("soft as felt hammers"). However, some phrasings are clunky or overwrought ("human-heart-sized contraption," "deep and resonant as a cello's final note"), and the required elements are occasionally stitched in with visible seams.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose flows well with good momentum, but is marred by several stock pairings and clichés ("swirling vortex," "feverish precision," "mind racing faster than," "beautiful disaster"). These artifacts flatten the texture of an otherwise imaginative scene.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is functional but marred by clichés ("impossibly steady," "frantic drumbeat") and the clumsy repetition of the "brightly attentive" tag. The sentence justifying the clue discovery is tautological ("signal... that only someone as brightly attentive as Elara would notice").

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from occasional filler and adjective stacking, such as "simple, yet endlessly complex." The repetition of the "weighted breath" motif is functional but feels slightly heavy-handed as a framing device.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with strong imagery throughout. However, the climax leans into purple phrasing ("thousand crystalline heartbeats," "overture to it") that strains the metaphor. The writing is technically sound but occasionally prioritizes poetic effect over clarity, particularly in the final paragraph's summarization.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished and sensory ("last growl," "moth’s wing") but occasionally overwrought ("canvas upon which memory painted"). The register drift caused by the required element creates a jarring artifact in the final third, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally polished but occasionally relies on abstract labels for peak moments ("staggering mental weight," "profound rightness") instead of concrete imagery. The forced grammatical fit of the prompt phrase "after the prophet arrives" creates a minor tense dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is technically polished but suffers from purple phrasing and a reliance on abstract summary over concrete scene work. The repetition of "lavender" and "vines" feels less like a motif and more like limited lexical range, while the passive construction distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose creates strong imagery ("fat teardrop," "speared the gloom"), but the middle section leans on scaffolding and telling ("He was finally able to decode," "He began to perceive"). These summarization artifacts reduce the immediacy and density of the pivotal discovery phase.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with standout phrases like "phantom limb of future knowledge" and "erosion of stone by mist." Minor abstract labels ("tidal longing," "dreamlike longing") appear briefly but are supported by concrete imagery, maintaining high line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong rhythm and imagery ("propeller slicing," "whisper of alignment"). While "diamond-dust stars" leans slightly toward cliché, the line-level execution is largely distinct and propulsive. The repetition of "luminous ache" works as a structural refrain rather than an artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose has a pleasant rhythm but suffers from tautological phrasing, most notably "kindness was a decisively kind force," which is a clunky attempt to integrate the prompt. Abstract labeling ("accumulated pain," "scent of hope") frequently replaces concrete embodiment of emotion. The writing is polished but relies too heavily on adjectives and abstract nouns to do the heavy lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is serviceable but marred by clichés (&quot;star-dusted velvet,&quot; &quot;dissolved like sugar&quot;) and occasional wordiness (&quot;colloquially termed&quot;) that saps momentum. The writing communicates the action clearly but relies on standard descriptors rather than fresh, specific language to convey the strangeness of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory verbs ("resonant thud," "grate of this new reality"). However, the density of metaphors occasionally borders on purple ("compound fracture of the soul," "cartography of his own failures"), slightly drawing attention to the writing rather than the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is competent and descriptive but suffers from adjectival clutter and occasional overwriting ("drink the grotto's gloom," "gentle encouragement"). The usage of filter verbs ("recalled," "vision... rose in her mind’s eye") creates unnecessary distance in key reflective beats. While the rhythm is smooth, the density of figurative language occasionally obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lyrical but suffers from modifier density ("soft weight," "fragile biome") and metaphor stacking. Phrasing occasionally leans into "telling" ("quietly proactive") with adjectives carrying weight that verbs should handle.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("tasted like ash," "scoured his soul clean") and occasionally lapses into opacity to accommodate prompts ("timeframe felt impossibly specific"). These artifacts create distance and reduce line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from adjectival bloating and well-worn phrases ("thick with a gathering hush," "pregnant with memories"). The reliance on telling the reader what images signify ("The light was not just light; it began to coalesce...") rather than letting the description do the work weakens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("moving stillness of purpose"). There is a slight tendency toward adjectival density ("resonant marrow," "skeletal branches") that borders on purple, but it generally serves the genre and tone well. Momentum is maintained through the procedural beats without becoming mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative ("lattice of spun silver," "ghost of the machine's operation"). However, a few phrases lean on cliché ("days bled into weeks," "surgical precision"), which slightly dulls the otherwise high-quality textural work.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery, but suffers from "thesaurus-itis" in spots ("glimmering," "shimmering" in close proximity). The hyphenated construction "boundary-lessly" is an awkward artifact. Passive phrasing in key moments ("the process completed") distances the reader from the magic's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose flows well, but the verbatim repetition of the distinctive phrase "hauntingly practical" in paragraphs 1 and 5 is a significant artifact. Additionally, abstract phrasing ("crystallized time," "crystalline moment") creates a slight synonym loop that dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose has strong rhythm, but suffers from abstract telling and modifier clutter (e.g., "sickeningly clear," "impossible loud"). Sentences like "Kael’s primary action... was the constant, heavy weight of regret" rely on abstract nominalization rather than active dramatization. The "audio-sieve" description is inventive, but the reliance on explaining motivation ("His motivation was simple, if insane") slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally smooth but relies too often on adverbs and abstract labels ("impossibly fine," "functionally creative," "rational disappointment") to convey meaning. These "telling" artifacts reduce the density and impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.8)
    Verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("thick with petrichor nostalgia," "crystal whispering forecourt after rain") creates syntactic clumsiness. Abstract clichés ("architecture of his soul") and heavy adverbs reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong imagery ("day-old bruise") competes with melodramatic phrasing ("tortured metal," "intuition screamed") and abstract summaries ("thick with secrets"). The simile "like a surfacing leviathan" for a small lockbox strains scale.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with some striking phrasing ("lightning bolt’s root"). However, a reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("profound oceanic hush," "encroaching gray") and abstract metaphors in key moments ("understanding bloomed") slightly reduces line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from density and overwriting ("exhaled the damp, sweet scent of decay," "disciplined act of empathy"). The reliance on abstract metaphors and adjective-heavy description slows momentum and distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.0)
    Several line-level issues mar the polish: "bedraggled" is repeated in close proximity (paragraphs 1 and 4), and "quaking reverie" is a confused metaphor (a daydream cannot quake). The phrase "long, drawn-out timeframe" creates a register clash, inserting corporate/technical language into a poetic atmosphere. The prompt integration appears forced, disrupting the syntactic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.7)
    Momentum is generally good, but the prose relies on "was/were" state descriptions and abstract nouns ("posture was gracefully alert," "unyielding compassion"). The explanatory sentence at the climax ("It was an act...") stalls the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level craft is competent, with some striking imagery, but occasionally leans into overwrought phrasing ("ghosted forth," "defiant hush"). There is a reliance on telling via abstract descriptors ("complex, dormant machine") where concrete sensory evidence would be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is fluid but occasionally overwritten, with some phrases leaning toward melodrama ("feelings too vast for a heart," "map of sorrow"). However, the rhythm is good, and the integration of prompt phrases is generally smooth, avoiding jarring seams.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is weighed down by purple phrasing ("thundering in his soul") and abstract telling ("profound sense of peace") rather than embodied detail. The use of "skeletal fingers" and "sun bled" introduces cliché artifacts that weaken line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.5)
    Syntactic monotony drags the middle section (repetitive subject-verb openings); phrases like "searing reverie" and "painstaking accumulation" lean toward overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is frequently overwritten, with mixed or confusing metaphors ("softer than falling dust," "clarity that felt like birdsong after a storm"). A distinct phrase loop ("velveteen gloom") appears in both the second and penultimate paragraphs, creating a noticeable artifact. The density comes from adjectives rather than information or action.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but tends toward adjective-heavy descriptions and metaphorical abstractions ("unwritten page of white," "desolate sea of extinction"). There is a reliance on stock gestures (taking a deep breath) and filter verbs that reduce immediacy and narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but frequently overwrought ("nook carved from stone and time," "lexicon of loss"), resulting in a density of adjectives that slows the narrative momentum. While the imagery is consistent, the reliance on high-register metaphors softens the edges of what should be a tense, illegal act.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.2)
    Reliance on telling via abstract modifiers ("transcendent peace," "serene compassion") weakens impact. The sentence "guided him through the process through incomplete information" contains a jarring repetition and abstract phrasing that mars the prose flow.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from abstract "telling" in the setup ("philosophy one of stark, material truth") and occasional clichés ("screamed of a civilization"). Adverb-heavy phrasing like "breathtakingly fine" and "resignedly certain" weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is competent and rhythmic, but relies on stock metaphors and clichés (&quot;turning a tide,&quot; &quot;frayed rope,&quot; &quot;ghosts of old arguments&quot;) that reduce freshness. The emotional climax relies on summary (&quot;imperfect, wavering, yet it was whole&quot;) rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by diagnostic telling ("tyranny of a painful past," "collective apathy") and redundancy ("tangled, chaotic"). Abstract labels often replace concrete imagery during key beats, smoothing over the visceral reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the prose has moments of strong imagery, it suffers from repetitive phrasing (e.g., “cascading consequence” and “cascading software glitch” in close proximity). The reliance on abstract nouns and explanatory sentences (“ cascading software glitch,” “profound relief”) dilutes the scene’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong phrasing like "fashionable contagion." However, it occasionally slips into hyperbole ("obscene violation" for footsteps) and relies on slightly twee personification ("streetlights daydreamed") that calls attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and atmospheric, though occasionally dense with metaphor ("voice of sculpted stone and patient coral"). Some phrases ("cascading revelations hit her") lean slightly into summary, but the line-level momentum generally supports the story's gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished and rhythmic ("not a clatter but a chime"), but suffers from a few clunky constructions, most notably the forced insertion of "balancedly daring." Some descriptions lean on abstract noun phrases ("uniform of his optimism") rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose flow is competent, though marred by "purple" descriptors ("saffron quiet") and cliché transitions ("Then, it happened"). Telling often replaces showing in key emotional beats ("familiar ache of doubt").

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is functional but relies on several clichés ("thin as spun glass," "shining eyes," "ragged hope") that flatten the emotional impact. The phrasing "historically oriented man" is clunky and used as a crutch. Line-level momentum is maintained, but the imagery often leans on standard descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    A significant repetition artifact ("puzzle of an ancient yoyo") occurs across two adjacent sentences, disrupting flow. Additionally, the phrasing "precision that was neatly inventive" reads as a forced prompt insertion that weakens the description of a master craftsman's work.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("dust-furred pedestal," "cage of bone"). Some metaphors lean toward the abstract or overwrought ("coated... like a lie," "silken scrape"), which occasionally draws attention to the writing rather than the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally evocative but suffers from adjective stacking ("restless euphony," "fragile sanctuary," "panic cacophony") and some cliché phrasing ("familiar thrum," "signature of a"). The "fractal generating" phrase feels clunky and abstract within the otherwise sensory, grounded scene.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and flows well, but suffers from "telling" emotions and realizations ("absolute certainty," "dread was a physical thing") instead of trusting the imagery. Some metaphors mix slightly ("sunwashed dread finally crystallizing"), but line-level momentum is generally maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("dust motes danced," "measured as a metronome," "gilded cage," "groaning oak door") that dull the imagery. This density of stock phrasing obscures the potentially sharp observation of the "cracked platform."

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is rhythmic but suffers from overwriting and clichés ("watery grave," "phantom limb of a distant storm"). There is a notable word-echo artifact in the third paragraph ("skeletal dome... skeletal hand") and the "hushed blaze" phrasing feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("shriek of wood," "ghost of an impression"). While highly competent, a few adjectival choices ("grand dome," "immense tome") lean slightly generic, keeping this just shy of the highest tier, but the "text-artifact" control is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a repetitive subject-verb sentence structure ("He began," "He retrieved," "He stood," "He placed," "He sat"). Additionally, the density of abstract metaphors ("skeletons," "ghosts," "velvet," "starlight," "luminous torment") borders on purple prose, occasionally obscuring the raw emotion with ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose contains vivid imagery but is marred by a significant proofreading artifact (" [ intricately tangible"), likely a bracketed draft note or syntax error. Additionally, the misuse of "titular" and some overwrought phrasing ("shriek of a missile," "satori") detract from the line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from a noticeable tense error early on and relies on stock "adjective-noun" pairings ("perpetually surprised," "cavernous silence," "profound peace"). Clichés like "hummed in her bones" and "knuckles were white" reduce the freshness of the imagery. The brevity prevents rhythm development.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from significant adjectival clutter and abstract metaphorical stacking ("acidic burn of his tempered regret," "sieved hush," "bleeding from blue to bruised purple"). These artifacts drag on momentum and obscure clarity, replacing concrete action with decorative description.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally polished but marred by mixed metaphors ("furrowed hush," "dividend of life") and occasional clichés ("sigh of the wind," "pale gaze"). These artifacts distract from the otherwise solid visual density.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor congestion (e.g., life as a beached vessel, pilot light, and broken keel all in one paragraph). These artifacts, combined with the telling of emotional states ("merrily melancholic"), obscure the action and slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies heavily on stock idioms and clichés ("clean slate," "shades of grey," "bread crumb," "blank page," "shattered world"), which dilutes the imagery. These artifacts prevent the writing from achieving the density and freshness required for high-band literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is functional and clear but hampered by an over-reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("deliberate grace," "potent aroma," "tangible ghost"). While the imagery is often strong, the density of modifiers and some stock phrasing ("worn leather pouch") reduce the muscularity of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally polished, but marred by forced phrasing to fit prompt elements ("willingly perplexed") and occasional noun-stacking clunkiness ("dolls’ tea set saucer crack"). The "willingly perplexed" insertion disrupts the flow and reads as a distinct artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwriting and metaphor stacking ("needle thin as a whisper," "thread of spun starlight," "heart an airy vessel"). These poeticisms reduce information density and create a soft-focus effect that blunts the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level craft is competent but suffers from modifier congestion ("soft, living pulse," "faint, ethereal streaks") and cliché paradoxes ("louder than a scream"). The prose prioritizes ornamentation over momentum, leading to a static, tableau-like rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose is readable and rhythmic, it relies heavily on clichés that flatten the literary quality ("iron fist," "ink-black," "swallowed the region whole," "thick with tension," "unreadable mask"). These stock phrases reduce the freshness of the imagery. The clarity is high, but the line-level craft lacks the invention seen in the setting concept.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, driving the narrative forward. There is a tendency toward density in figurative language ("panicked fractals," "dying star’s corpse") that occasionally draws attention to the writing rather than the action during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from modifier congestion and adverb-heavy telling ("furiously tranquil," "finally, honestly trembling," "silently blasted"). These artifacts clutter the rhythm and dilute the impact of the otherwise strong imagery, reducing immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("silent monument of patience," "burnished composite"). Information density is high, and the pacing matches the action well, though a few phrases lean slightly purple ("fluid syllogism executed in tempered steel").

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and rich, with strong imagery ("moon, a sliver of bone") driving the atmosphere. It occasionally tilts into overwriting ("luminous fracture," "hushed reverence"), but the style is largely purposeful and supports the character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.5)
    Frequent adjective-noun pairings ("grand navigational dial," "tiny brass one," "transient pathways") create a rhythmic stutter; "drop of silvered sorrow" reads as a clichéd sentimental artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose flow is smooth, but the text suffers from specific artifacts, notably the verbatim repetition of "impossible blues/blue" in the first and seventh paragraphs. Reliance on abstract phrasing ("luminous doubt," "hollow history") and some clichés ("thirsty ground") dampens line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is competent but marred by "thesaurus-itis" and mixed metaphors ("crystalline shard," "tides of remembrance") that obscure rather than illuminate. The phrasing often feels constructed to house the prompt elements, leading to unnatural collocations like "cerulean regret" acting as a color description. Rhythm is steady, but the density of abstract nouns drags on the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty: “dust from a butterfly wing, millions of microscopic scales” packs object, origin, and beauty into one clause. Metaphors stay physics-true (“cosmic clockwork”) without self-contradiction. One paraphrase loop—“decay…decay”—but it serves as intentional reverb. Peak beat is clean: no filter-verb stacks, no mixed vehicles. Final line earns its quiet uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors (“kiln a maw of blackened brick,” “conversation she finally understood”) are precise, not stacked for purple effect. Information density high—single sentences advance setting, emotion, and clue simultaneously. Zero scaffolding; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Closure sentence (“its silence was a conversation she finally understood”) lands clean, recharging prior auditory motif.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dense yet breathable: each sentence layers sense, motion, and metaphor—flagstones / chilled / silent; thermal tapestry / cool blues / placid gold. No loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is selective: only two metaphors (ocean symphony, cellular anticipation) and both thematic. Final sentence propels outward—“space where a new kind of music could begin”—without exposition. Copy-clean except missing hyphen in “winterglass.”

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud ear is excellent: cadence swells and ebbs with depth, sentences vary in length and stress. Metaphors are controlled—lens as key, ocean as blanket, silence as caught prey—no mixed vehicles. Information density high; single sentences perform triple duty (anchor body, reveal lore, tilt emotion). Zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Only micro-flaw: “like a blanket” appears in two separate image clusters; minor echo, not closure-touching.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwritten: three liquid-light metaphors in two sentences create minor density drag. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Opening and closing lines anchor and resonate. One homophone-risky phrase (“read” for “red” not present); copy is clean. Peak beat (spark epiphany) avoids figurative muddle, earns its metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence variety is orchestral: participial openings for slipping time, hard declaratives for erasure beat. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“sandpaper, grinding him down”—never overwriting the climactic moment. Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffold; information density high. Opening line anchors stakes instantly, final line resolves by image that re-cues the entire maze, satisfying 9+ bar.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences carry double duty: “She pushed the bench aside, revealing a small, corroded panel…” advances action while re-anchoring spatial relation. No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse, taught early (“cold iron ligament”) and reprised at closure. Rhythm accelerates across key-insertion beats via parataxis, then breathes into the final ray-of-light clause. Proof-level clean: pronouns track, tense stable, no simultaneity errors, opening and final lines frame voice and stakes exactly.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances tool, body, or atmosphere. Metaphors internally consistent: forge = cold luminescence, not heat; violet-grey = sonic, not visual spill. High density: “ghost-white apple blossoms bloomed in the filtered, aquatic light” fuses color, biology, and hydro-logic in one stroke. Final line cadence mirrors cellular division—three stressed beats, pause, three beats—earned echo of opening orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: transit maps + lunar charts compress prep without stall. Metaphors stay coherent—moonbeams as “liquid silver threads” extends the photographic motif. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; paragraph cuts clean. Read-aloud rhythm is musical, varied. Proofing is clean. The single elision of the actual theft is a micro lost opportunity for sensory specificity, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with scene heat—long sentences for furnace ritual, fragments as floor tilts. Metaphors stay physical (crystalline prison, fiery belly) without overwriting; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “steady drip… melancholic beat” repeats conceptually but serves cadence. Information density high; each line advances state or temperature. Closure sentence clean, image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “spray of distant stars” marries visual scale to emotional vertigo. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors (“ghost he had programmed”) stay singular and coherent. One tiny overwriting puff—“a certainty that felt like an earthquake in my soul”—is forgiven because it’s immediately grounded in the tactile act of decoding. Mechanics clean; pronoun tracking immaculate even when “he” switches between Julian and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with hush-to-gale cadence; sentence variance avoids drumbeat. Information density high—one line can anchor setting, stake, and metaphor: “a single star pulsed, a final diamond stud in a vast, dimming velvet.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor near-repeat of “silence” in adjacent sentences (−0.2) but does not touch closure. Figurative language serves texture, not decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety is high; no template cadence or synonym churn. Metaphors are specific and consistent (glass, wet stone, charcoal) without stacked purple. Density is high: one sentence often performs atmosphere + interiority + propulsion. Only nit: “crystal whispering” appears twice—once as forecourt, once as park moonlight; the echo is purposeful but teeters on over-leitmotif. No grammar slips; pronouns clean; paragraph cuts are crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    High-density lines (“a river of living jewels,” “landscape of blooming, withering grace”) carry triple duty without purple drag. One paraphrase loop—“a number that suggested blight…”—slips in early but does not recur; closure sentence is clean, rhythmic, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “stained with hydraulic fluid and mapped with fine white scars” does triple duty—occupation, history, sensory specificity. No paraphrase loops; no filler. Metaphors are coherent and sparse: “ocean of possibility” is single, earned, mid-paragraph. Sentence variety supports momentum—participial openers kept in check. Register stable; no thesaurus churn. Final line passes paragraph-cut test: removing “The icy air… multitudes” would erase the conceptual repricing. Proofing clean; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses—varies sentence length, no template runs. High density: “capillary action was immediate, the water greedily climbing” does three jobs. One mixed metaphor (“ribs of balconies”) is minor. No scaffold, loops, or adverb clutter. Final paragraph’s ceremonial cadence matches solemnity without purple swell. Closure image untouched by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty (sensor data + emotional charge). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “auroral sorrow” and “indigestible stone,” but figurative layer is sparse enough to stay coherent. Final line lands with imagistic snap.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean, propulsive; sentences multitask—"I clicked on my headlamp, its beam cutting a shaky circle in the absolute black, and began walking toward the sound" advances action, body, and mood. No loops, filter-stack, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into clipped clauses during wheel confrontation, then relaxes into longer fall-off, mirroring tension arc. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the beam/weight motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from fungal glow to monosyllabic shard; no template cadence. Information density high: one sentence slips library, catacombs, fungi, keeper role. Figurative language is sparse under peak pressure, avoiding artifact. Minor loop: “silence was not an absence but a presence” echoes prior negation cadence; does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm modulates: looping pre-eclipse sentences elongate, then fragment at totality (“A strange, ethereal twilight…”). Information density is high—each sentence advances image or emotional charge. No mixed metaphors; corona-as-hope is single, sustained vehicle. Minor scaffold: “the life, still humming, still here” is partial paraphrase, but it occurs mid-scene, not at closure, and is spoken to Lena, so momentum survives.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is near-loop-free; only trace scaffold is “the great bronze quiet” echoed twice, but the repetition is pattern-taught and pays off in the final sentence. Metaphors stay coherent—walls cup water, dragons die—no mixed vehicles. Information density peaks in the diary lines, where every clause adds new catastrophic knowledge. Final line lands with perfect cadence and visual punch, no clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence layers job, tool, and mood. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Varied sentence openings; paragraph cuts land on tactical pivots. “Tinny echo,” “salt-scar,” “discordant music” are fresh yet precise. Proofing clean; zero artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but breathable; each sentence layers sound or silence without overlap. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“silver mesh cool against fingertips”). Information dual-loads: pedal blink is both visual and menace. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates with loop stutters then stops dead on the vacuum—mechanical cadence mirrors collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density—each sentence advances map, body, or sky. Figurative layer (“needle stitching sky to lake”) is vivid yet controlled; no mixed-metaphor muddle. Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts tight. One minor cadence repetition in “He worked feverishly...” trio, but momentum sustains. Closure image untouched by artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero paraphrase loops; high density—“needle met the spinning vinyl” advances atmosphere, stakes, and tactile immediacy in five words. Metaphors are coherent (silence as tapestry, valley as question). No scaffold; final sentence lands on image, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm flexes from long accumulative clauses (storm description) to staccato prepositional beats (“He looked up… He would need…”) mirroring rising resolve. Figurative control high: no mixed metaphors, vehicles obey atmospheric physics. Information density strong—each sentence layers barometer, emotion, spatial cue. Minor filter-verb cluster (“He felt…”) survives only in low-pressure beat, forgiven; none in closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence opens setting, stakes, sensory defense. Figurative language selective—only two metaphors (sun as “crystalline splinters,” grief as “damp wool”) and both tie to glass/fabric textures Elias would notice. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and cadence. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (tears + scent) without explanatory gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “shimmer that did not radiate heat” slips world-rule into sensory cue. No loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors (library of burned books) stay consistent with Elias’s vocation. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“softened…into the air”) that recharges earlier starlight motif.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “rust-colored skeletons of pear trees” packs sight, mortality, and orchard history in five words. Varied sentence openings; no template cadence. Mixed-metaphor risk (“searching vine” arpeggio) is brief and absorbed by overall lyric consistency; no loops or scaffold. Final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—long clauses during memory flood, staccato fragments as crystal phial is lifted. Figurative language is selective, never stacked in peak beats; vehicles stay consistent (storm, charge, stone). Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves with image that recharges amber motif. Grammar immaculate; no ambiguous pronouns.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; figurative language sparse enough to avoid purple freight. No synonym loops or template cadence. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) fits broker who thinks in abstractions yet stays within plausible lexicon. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge salt/star motif. Minor scaffold: “felt the last notes…fade” could lose “felt,” but artifact never obscures causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet breathable—one sentence often does double duty (e.g., “a monument to a resilience he felt he had no claim to” reveals world and wound). No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse, taught early, and paid off. Register never drifts into academic diction. Final line’s “two halves of his world become one” risks slight template cadence but lands as earned closure image, so −0.1 only.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often does setting, metaphor, and causality—“Crystalline structures…humming with dissonant energy” shows cause of worsening arrhythmia. Occasional ornamental adjectives (“shimmering limbs”) but never in closure beats. Rhythm modulates: calm catalog gives way to staccato crisis clauses, then settling cadence. No loops or mixed metaphors; minor over-use of present participle openers keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image, causality, or emotional density. Figurative language is sparse, deliberate—glass eyes “like captured stars” sets up their later capture of star-bright lattice. No mixed metaphors; lattice, void, seedling form one coherent optical field. Information density peaks in the lattice paragraph where three sensory channels (sight, sound, touch) operate in one sentence without crowding.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: “desiccated silverfish and grit” does world, touch, and decay in five words. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for creeping, fragments for flicker beats. One scaffold paraphrase (“he watched … he watched”) is the only detectable loop; it dulls momentum minutely but does not touch closure. Metaphors stay physical and consistent: “dark offering on a silver altar” sustains the sacramental conceit without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-driven; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layer (trellis as beast skeleton) is sparse and purposeful. High information density: breath-fog anchors scene, leaf-pocketing advances plot and metaphor simultaneously. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction appears only in meta phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “salt-crusted memories,” “chaotic calligraphy” compress history and sensation in one clause. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay inside painterly logic—sunlight as trapped resin, mud as text—so no physical logic clash. Final line’s “haggard awe” re-uses the opening adjective, now re-weighted, earning lyrical callback without repetition artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lyric but disciplined; no mixed metaphors or filler stacks. Sentence rhythm modulates with scene tempo—long clauses for meditation, single stressed beats for the final note. One paraphrase loop (“she saw… she saw… she saw…”) is purposeful, a triplet that mimics cascading vision. No artifacts in the closure beat; final line earns silence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: high density—each sentence advances archive, atmosphere, or interiority; no synonym loops or template cadence. Figurative choices stay physically loyal; mixed metaphor absent. Rhythm modulates—long tidal sentences vs. crisp labeling beats. Only hairline slip: “foundation of their home, though broken, was still here” flirts aphorism yet is earned by prior concrete fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: longer clauses for city drift, fragments at portal punch. High information density—strap-adjust, map-dare, punch-myth compressed in three sentences. No mixed metaphors; only one paraphrase loop (“trembling certainty” x2). Closure line “mapped his final route and arrived at his new beginning” is tidy but not redundant; momentum survives.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary from staccato bursts under storm pressure to long tidal clauses during revelation; zero paraphrase loops. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“skeletal remains of the stargazer’s open tower” marries architecture to corpse without purple drift. Final line offers a rhythmic echo of the opening, closing the acoustic circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: rolling anaphora under star-storm, then clipped final step. High density—“cosmic vandalism,” “negation of somewhere”—do double duty. One metaphor mix: “star-crushing boredom” is physical but works. No loops, no scaffold; only micro-flaw is three adjectives in “prismatic, shimmering, agitated ghosts” that could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “She sought the mathematics of a fair trade” simultaneously exposits motive and foreshadows the graph-paper payoff. Figurative control is tight—no mixed metaphors, no filler loops. Only hairline repetition: “quiet” used twice in opening paragraph; otherwise propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence layers material or advances atmosphere; minimal scaffolding. Rhythm mirrors tide—long sentences swell, then fragment at horn blast. No mixed metaphors; figurative language is coherent (violet grief stays pigment, never liquefies). One paraphrase loop detected (“the tide breathes in... breathes out...”) but it is pattern-taught and serves cadence; no closure touch, so cap not triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and patterned—no metaphor pile-ups at peak. Rhythm modulates with bow-stroke tension, accelerating then dropping into absolute silence. One paraphrase loop (“resonant hum” echoed twice in adjacent clauses) is minor. Clean grammar, no scaffold, strong paragraph cuts.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences pull double duty (scene-setting + character state). No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Minor scaffolding: “chaotic symphony” and “ceaseless lapping” are familiar phrases but functional. High information density; paragraph cut test passes. Artifacts do not touch closure; momentum sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ear-test passes: rhythm swells and contracts with temperature and tension. Figurative control is disciplined—only two metaphors, both solar, both earned. Information density high: one sentence can layer tool, body, and emotional stake (“crushed the grain…glowing dust…chemical callnote”). Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line offers resonant after-image.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary from short surgical bursts to longer liquid lines that mirror water motion; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse and apt (“its whirring a dissonant, painful thrum”). Opening line anchors tone and stakes; final line resolves by sonic image. Zero paraphrase loops, zero mixed metaphors, high information density—every clause advances repair, time, or sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold. Sentences do twin duty: “Condensation began to bloom…branching and connecting with impossible intricacy” shows world-change and metaphor in one breath. Rhythm accelerates into short, percussive clauses as the hum rises. Final line lands with imagist punch that recharges “humming dark” from paragraph one. Read-aloud cadence is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences do double duty: “His footfalls were not random; they were a deliberate percussion” advances both action and method. No synonym churn or template cadence; each metaphor (bruised twilight, sculptor of echoes) is used once and paid off. One mixed metaphor—“shattered by the dissonance of the Collapse”—is forgiven amid otherwise clean orchestration. Momentum breathes at paragraph breaks that mirror street turns, sustaining propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose carries variegated rhythm: long hypnotic sentences for the temple description, staccato fragments during the psychic onslaught. Information density is high—each sentence advances stake, sensorium, or metaphor; no scaffold or synonym loops. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image (“it was a perfect memory, and now, it was mine”) that fuses theme and fate. One hairline slip: “liquid midnight” appears in two adjacent clauses, but the second use reweights the phrase from visual to existential, earning its repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Varied sentence cadence mirrors climb and vertigo; clauses tighten into single-word beats at reveal. Zero scaffold/loop; metaphors are internally coherent (rust, salt, amber). High density—every detail salts the later collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: single sentence potting soil → bead → bone chime does three jobs. No paraphrase loops; metaphors consistent (botanical/alchemical). One mixed image—“veil swirled as if in phantom wind”—minor, doesn’t fog closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies: sibilance mirrors hush, then staccato dissolves. Proofing clean; no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences in the dreaming nights to clipped urgent fragments during the storm (“He anchored. He worked. He bled.”). No paraphrase loops or template cadences; each metaphor is single-layer and physically coherent (“threads…humming with a low, resonant music” literalizes wind-as-bow). Opening line anchors stakes and voice simultaneously; final line crystallizes map-into-music with echo of “threads of memory and hope.” Minor over-modification in “bruised yellow” sky costs −0.2, but clarity at closure is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is spare and purpose-driven: “silver vein slithering over bleached-white clavicle” fuses bone, metal, and tree in one stroke. No mixed metaphors; register remains within Elara’s plausible vocabulary. Opening and closing lines act as tonal brackets—root trace to sun strike—creating echo without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “dormant game cabinets into monoliths of silent gold” carries atmosphere and stakes in one stroke. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; every sentence advances. Opening line anchors voice and concept; final line resolves by image that recharges prior chalk/letter motifs. Minor intensifier “vast, empty arcade” could be leaner, but artifact does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean, high-density, and almost free of scaffold; only a faint echo (“the silence was now filled with a new echo”) edges toward self-paraphrase. Figurative language is restrained to two needle/flame images that avoid mixed-metaphor clutter. Rhythm modulates with task: long silk sentences vs. clipped terminal commands, propelling rather than stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from humid coils to shard-sharp fragments; no two openings repeat. Figurative layering is dense yet precise—“air thick as unsent letter’s ink” fuses setting and theme in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every clause adds new pressure or sensory angle. A single hairline slip: “temporal stillness heavy with the ghosts of words” edges toward abstraction, but the next line re-anchors to the shard.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero scaffold loops; no synonym churn. Figurative language is spare, tactile: “lotus-hearted ache” risks purple but pays off as the exact bloom of tenderness inside clinical sterility. Sentence rhythm modulates—long Hypnotic accumulations for drug haze, staccato for Varin’s entrance—propelling rather than padding. Information density high; every line either decrypts, embodies, or re-prices.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Metaphors stay internally coherent (fog as grey silk, tree as frozen lightning) and serve physical logic rather than ornament. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Information density high: one line can layer tool cue, sensory data, and conceptual risk—“the memory he sought to project was a fragile, light-saturated negative, easily washed out.” No artifact touches closure beat; clarity propels rather than obstructs.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long languid clauses in liquid twilight, staccato triad at re-entry. Metaphors stay internally consistent—sound as fabric, garden as instrument. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or choice. "Bewitch" used thrice with intentional escalation, avoiding repetition fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong verbs and sensory nouns propel every line; no scaffolding, no mixed metaphors. Figurative layering (“wilting sunflower was a period on a sentence”) stays controlled and image-driven. One paraphrase loop: “converging chaos was no longer approaching; it was here” essentially repeats. Otherwise, density and propulsion peak in the orchid-insert beat.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet buoyant—every line doubles duty (image + emotional calculus). Metaphors stay organically marine; no mixed vehicle violations. One paraphrase loop detected (“quiet, constant hum of wakefulness” echoes later “quiet awe”), minor −0.2. Filter verbs rare; strong verbs (“ensconce,” “lodging,” “reefed”) propel. Closure beat free of artifact; rhythm tightens into monosyllabic final line that reverberates.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with the ritual—long sentences for dusting, clipped fragments for the final note. Figurative control is tight: “opal floors...captive light of forgotten dawns” marries sight to concept without purple drift. Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffold. Only micro-slip: “beautiful, toxic sadness” flirts with label-speak yet is saved by the foxglove anchor two lines later.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, tension, or character. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“dust motes danced like constellations” sets tone without overwriting. Information density is high: “powdered moon-quartz mixed with his own blood” packs world-rule, ritual logic, and cost in one clause. Final line—“a fragile, resonant chord of hope”—delivers cadence that echoes musical spell without lapsing into purple.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence either advances clue-hunt or layers paternal ache. Figurative language stays mechanical-thermal (“geologic sighs,” “volcano took its morning breath”) without overwriting. Zero paraphrase loops; each detail (amber glue, etched links) returns with new work to do. Opening and closing lines are anchored to body and tool, satisfying ear-test.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and musical—dust “curling the edges of his life,” “bloom too fragile”—yet each figurative move advances atmosphere or character. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph cuts are clean. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharged motif. A single near-overwrite (“universe of dancing dust”) survives because the pattern is taught and reprised at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density—each sentence layers forecast, symbol, or bodily response. A few metaphor strings flirt with purple (“world hummed in a fractured hush”) but pattern-teach the lyric rule early. No loops or scaffold; opening anchor is clean. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “cosmic gales”—slightly overshoots child-POV yet stays consistent within mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm breathes with scene—short clauses during corridor walk, longer cadence at dome reveal. Figurative language is selective: “symphony of stressed metal,” “galaxy of bioluminescent life,” no mixed metaphors. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or relationship. “Shadowseam wonder” could feel mannered but is earned by prior darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry double duty—description advances plot, e.g., “glowing turquoise” simultaneously signals memory and foreshadows meteor. Only light scaffold: two adjacent “Then…” openers; no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is disciplined, avoids mixed metaphors, density peaks only at climactic flare without clutter. Could trim 2–3 adjectives (“impossibly smooth”) for 9-band, but line craft is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with tide cadence; sentences vary length to mirror water build-up. One mixed metaphor (“spear of light” after “wind chimes”) is minor; no loops or scaffold. Information density high—each sentence does scenic + atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud cadence is near-flawless: sentence openings vary, no template churn, and metaphor density peaks only at the climax where it is earned. Tight concision—every line layers image or heat; scaffolding is minimal. One mixed vehicle—“pinpoint of perfect shadow” rubbing against “cool dark fire” momentarily blurs physical logic, a hairline slip that keeps it from 9+. Otherwise, propulsion, clarity, and sonic pleasure are exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm: long sentences for dawn hush, clipped fragments at ripple climax. Figurative language is sparse, never stacked; metaphors obey physical logic. Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or insight. One tiny scaffold: “a stone—not too large, not too small—” could compress, but it occurs early and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; no filter-verb stacks. Figurative layers serve pattern: porcelain web = scar map. “Tributary carved by flashover” compresses geology and electricity in one stroke. Rhythm breathes with the stars’ procession; final sentence lands on monosyllabic closure: “price willingly paid.”

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean, muscular, information-dense: “water slid across the sand, first touching the outermost shells” does triple sensory and causal duty. No scaffold, no loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and exact. Sentence rhythm mirrors tidal pull—long swells, then crisp recoil. One dangling participle barely grazes the closure beat but clarity remains untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences are lean, multi-tasking: “The walls here hummed with a low, persistent frequency of anxiety” fuses setting, metaphor, and character perception in one stroke. No scaffold or synonym loops; figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (“legacy’s burden”). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propel momentum. Zero artifacts in closure beat; clarity never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to the staccato “seeds of light” close, mirroring spell-dissolution. Metaphors (liquid rainbows, silent orchestra) stay coherent within optic/acoustic frame. Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances image or spell logic. Density is high—each sentence carries sensory plus causal payload—without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density: “marble beneath his worn boots cracked like a shattered promise” performs metaphor, anchors setting, and foreshadows treaty fragility in one stroke. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing sentences mirror with “dust” and “light,” creating purposeful echo. One minor adverbial cluster—“slowly drew nearer”—but cadence demands slack; does not obscure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold. Every sentence does at least two jobs: “tires hissed over the crystalline expanse” plants sound, reveals surface, implies solitude. Metaphors are spare, never mixed; “mineral ghost” and “frozen embers” are precise physical descriptions as well as emotional corrosives. Opening line anchors salt + time + culpability; final line resolves with the same three vectors reweighted. Read-aloud rhythm is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “harvest of echoes,” “spectral residue,” “rigid posture of his duty and the silent scream beneath” all twin-load image and emotion. One mixed metaphor—“lullaby of conformity…demanded the soul as payment”—slips into abstraction; trimming that clause would sharpen. Otherwise no loops, no scaffold, every sentence advances.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies gracefully; sentence openings rotate between prepositional, participial, and noun starts, avoiding drumbeat. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors per high-pressure paragraph—so density never stalls momentum. No synonym loops or scaffold; “stick” is reused, not euphemism-churned. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, not explanatory. Minor tic: two “hush” variants within four lines, but the echo is purposeful, not unconscious.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: one sentence often layers tactile verb, sensory filter, and causal linkage ("pulled the vine taut for the culminating knot, a prayer tied with the quiet reverence of a scholar closing a sacred book"). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphor. Final line earns its cadence without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet lucid; single sentences perform three jobs (e.g., “He connected the last re-plaited strand, the final note in the sequence. The sanctum held its breath.”—action, musical metaphor, environmental response). No synonym loops or template cadence; each verb is precise (“unbraid,” “re-plait,” “coalesce”). One near-mixed metaphor (“snowmelt ardor that defied frost”) but physical logic stays intact. Closure image (“ghost of a ghost”) is crisp, uncluttered, and rhythmically cadenced.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty—world-build, advance ritual, texture starlight. Zero loops; no scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“tomb awaiting a new corpse”—but it is voice-motivated palace irony and does not recur. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long spiral sentences to final staccato sweep. Closure image is uncluttered, crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and integrated—“resentment so ancient it had become a law of physics”—never layered into purple. Rhythm accelerates across the final paragraph to match dimensional grinding, then resolves into the single hum sentence that serves as the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft shows high-density layering: single sentence often handles tool detail, sensory body, and atmospheric tilt. Varied sentence rhythm avoids algorithmic patterns; paragraph cuts land on image pivot. No mixed metaphors; “fracture line thin as spider’s thread” stays inside physical logic. Occasional Latinate loft (“lattice of frozen breath”) barely nicks register but does not stall beat; closure image untouched by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes with escalation: longer reflective sentences on memory, staccato clauses during seed insertion. Information density high—single lines do setting + emotion + tool state. No scaffold loops; only one near-repeat (“lush orchard” echoed) but serves as motif hinge. Metaphors stay coherent (crystal as living bough) and do not invade clarity; opening and closing lines anchor and recharge voice.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high density (“void of potential in a place teeming with impossible realities”). Occasional poetic overwrite (“achingly empty”) but never clouds causality. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final line is crisp, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary from short gasps to winding clauses that mimic memory bleed; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“memories like watercolor paintings left in the rain”—and never stacks into purple. One paraphrase loop: “blissfully aberrant peace” is echoed as “blissful aberration” two paragraphs later; minor but noticeable. Otherwise high density: each sentence advances memory rewrite or stakes. Copy is clean; pronouns track.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is scaffold-free; every sentence either advances mechanism detail or tightens Elias’s internal gauge. Rhythms mimic clock escapements: longer sentences wind, short ticks release. Metaphors are clean (serpent seal as diagram) and internally consistent. No looped phrasing, no mixed vehicles, no register drift. Final line lands with cadence that echoes the twelfth chime.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose breathes with scene: polysyndeton during assembly, then clipped release at click of shard. Figurative layer is spare—only “bruised twilight” and “thistle seed”—each pays off in closure image. No loops, no filter stacks; lavender beam lands clean. One near-miss: “world-ending quiet” skirts hyperbole but is earned by prior collapse vision.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm mirrors storm cadence: long rolling sentences build, then fracture into staccato keystrokes. Metaphors are spare and precise—“lightning spiderwebbed,” “discordant note”—never stacked. One paraphrase loop (“the hush that remained was no longer one of absence, but of profound understanding”) could lose half its clause, but it lands outside the closure beat so penalty is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence openings diversify. High info-density: chemical chant packs world + character + mood. No scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors. Figurative language sparse after midpoint, keeping closure image clear. Strong verbs (“bled,” “wove,” “reweighted”) replace modifiers. Minor paraphrase risk in “heavy blanket” line but does not recur.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: sentence lengths swell and contract with reflection. Figurative language is selective—no metaphor stacking in peak beats. One minor paraphrase loop: “slow, unhurried progress” could compress. No register drift, no filter-verb stacks. Opening and final lines are propulsive and image-rich.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm, propelling ascent and descent; figurative language is selective (“silence that tasted of ozone”) and never muddies causality. No loops, no mixed metaphors, clean tense and pronoun control. High information density—each line doubles as sensory ground and emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; metaphors (cathedral of peace, ghost of the train) are spare and coherent. No loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles. Sentence rhythm modulates without algorithmic pattern. Opening and closing lines bookend the whistle-echo motif. Minor elevated diction (“vaulting hush”) is earned by context and does not obscure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences do triple duty: “Crystalline trees hummed with latent power, their branches heavy with glowing, data-rich fruit” fuses sensorium, world-rule, and stakes in one breath. No scaffold loops; each flake-peel advances both plot and texture. Rhythm climbs across paragraph breaks, mirroring staircase formation. Only one near-muddle—“memory-less depths” could be sharper—keps this from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies; high-pressure beat uses fragments (“The unbearable pressure… converged”) to mimic intake of breath. No filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops; “silvered” and “ozone” do double duty (texture + world). Metaphors stay physically coherent—pressure into diamonds is literalized, not decorative. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image cleanly. One scaffold-like clause (“a reminder that some things were built to withstand pressure”) is tolerated because it seeds theme.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences pull double duty: “golden shadows that danced like ghosts” sets tone and stakes simultaneously. No synonym loops or scaffold; each detail either advances crank protocol or deepens dynastic mood. Figurative language peaks at climax (“pressure that felt as if it could crack glass”) then relinquishes to stark final image. Grammar clean, pronoun tracking flawless, spatial choreography maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is lean and image-dense; every paragraph advances choice or atmosphere. Metaphors (liquid moonlight, faulty lantern) are precise and internally consistent; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: longer anaphoric sentences build storm, then staccato “Now.” releases it. One paraphrase loop (“the very air grew thin…air grew colder”) is the only noticeable scaffold; it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence handles scent, sound, and emotional math. Metaphors are controlled—“silence…a heavy blanket,” “paper…stiff with memory”—and paid off by closure. No loops or scaffold detected; opening and final lines are sharply cadenced. Register stays within an archivist’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathe-able: “Dusk bled purple and orange” hands off to “rain slicked the streets into dark mirrors” without a wasted syllable. Metaphors stay mutually coherent—light, water, reflection—no mixed vehicles. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Opening and closing lines function as resonant brackets, recharging the motif of visible/invisible light. A single clause (“the metal resisted for a moment, a sigh of corrosion”) contains tactile sound, personification, and forward motion—typical of the micro-efficiency sustained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythmic control mirrors musical breath: long sentences for legato phrases, abrupt caesuras for silence framing. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances hush, light, or drip pattern. Metaphors are precise—“stone teeth,” “parasitic melody”—without muddle. Information density high: one sentence slips setting, stakes, and sensory cue (“air grew cooler…mist that was his constant companion”). Final line’s monosyllabic chill—“another morning”—lands as cadence release.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tension: parataxis accelerates during descent, then relaxes into quiet declaratives at the waterfall. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence layers new sensory angle (sound of water → smell of wet stone → visual fracture). Metaphors are internally coherent—clock imagery recurs but never mixed. Opening and closing lines perform bookend cadence: “quiet tick” → “phantom galaxies swirl,” a sonic echo of consonants.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm: cadence shifts from rain-patter sibilants to furnace roar plosives, mirroring rising heat. Information density high—every line does setting, emotion, and rule-building. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with imagistic precision. Minor cobalt/viridian color tags flirt with purple but stay within POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length; high information density—each clause adds sensory or emotional data. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (sound = river, light = music). Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve by image. Minor overworld tint in “luminous ache” and “music of luminous ache” appears twice but is pattern-taught early and pays off at closure; does not obscure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops, high density: single sentences do triple duty (“violet penance” = color + moral + physical weight). Metaphors are consistent—forest as lab, light as pressure—no mixed vehicles. Strong verbs (“decanted,” “cinched,” “shivered”) cut adjectives. Opening and closing lines book-end with the strap, creating a sonic echo. Only hairline slip: “displaced rooted” abstraction appears twice; second use could be pruned.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty: “canvas smelled of linseed oil and ozone” plants setting + stakes in one sniff. No filler-verb stacks or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent (lens as lamp, history as freight). One paraphrase loop (“constant companion” / small hand / carried) is minor. Opening and closing lines both punch—anchor and re-charge—with natural rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances image or causation. Metaphors are spare and precise: “memory in the silent air.” Information density high—“county supervisor, true to his word, cut the main power” contains time, authority, and cause in nine words. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: staccato ladder climb, then soft release. Closure sentence is clean, unadorned, letting the brass glint do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and processional, matching the slow accretion of frost. Figurative language is selective—never more than one image per beat—so density feels controlled, not purple. No synonym loops or template cadence; each sentence advances either sensory or conceptual layer. Opening and closing lines are crisp anchors that frame the textural crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative density peaks during storm yet remains coherent: “waves of pearlescent light” is anchored to physical action. No synonym loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“temporal squall,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by POV’s academic bent and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances tuning, doubt, or sensory feedback. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“covenant of rust,” “tinkersong wonder”—none clutter the high-pressure beat. Strong verbs (guttered, flared, erupted) replace modifiers. Final chord sentence is long but syntactically controlled, mirroring the wave it describes. No artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances scent, stone, or stake. Metaphors are coherent—“silence so profound it felt like a physical presence.” Information density high: “vials she knew she would likely never fill” does double duty—object and foreshadowing. Final line is propulsive, recharging “resonant hush” as internalized aurora.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative layer (“star chart drawn by a ghost”) is brief, pattern-taught, paid off. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Micro-risk: occasional alliteration (“constant, low thrum that vibrated”) borders euphony, but rhythm serves turbine motif and never stalls clarity. Closure image clean, unadorned, potent.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.2)
    High information density: single sentences layer time, color, ancestry (“autumn pavilion now connected to the silvery revelation”). No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Metaphors are painter-precise—“petals like captured moonlight”—and internally consistent. Rhythm breathes with discovery, accelerates toward final portrait reveal; opening and closing lines bookend with color/light motif.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: “fragile cage of a sea urchin’s skeleton” does triple sensory/specific/symbolic duty. Only one paraphrase loop (“searing reverie… searing quality”) and one register lift (“conceptual repricing”-like phrasing in commentary). Otherwise rhythm breathes with escalation, no mixed metaphors. Clean grammar, strong verbs, zero scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm varies from measured开园句 to staccato prophecy fragments. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Metaphors (velvet disquiet, sonic bulwark) stay coherent and specific. High information density: “fragile, paper-thin wax cylinder phonograph shaving” compresses object, fragility, and process in one breath.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: one sentence = seed-image, ancestral memory, and causal rule. No paraphrase loops; metaphors (snowflake on tongue, storm in drop) are precise and internally consistent. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with pressure—no template cadence. Minor hedge “began to” appears twice; not in closure beat so −0.1 only.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and pressure-aligned: “red eye in the gloom.” High information density—each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Only one near-repeat: “solstice hush” appears twice; the second use could be trimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from lull to burn; no template cadence. Information density is high—“silent cathedral of dormant machinery” does triple duty: setting, tone, metaphor. No mixed metaphors; the lantern glass as “key” and “filter” is consistent. Zero loops or scaffold; the only near-repeat (“stillness…still”) is purposeful emphasis, not churn.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes—sentence length varies; no template cadence. Information density high: one line can paint heat, loss, and bee lore. Metaphors obey physics (light fractured through glass). Zero paraphrase loops. Minor scaffold: “stained glass box” repeated three times in 60 words mid-story; doesn’t tangle causality or touch closure, hence −0.1 only.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “metallic wound spilling secrets” compresses container, injury, and revelation in five words. Rhythm modulates to echo emotional intensity, slowing during shard-meditation, staccato at traveler-message reveal. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay physical (sand, bone, lattice). Sentence openings vary; no template cadence detected. One paraphrase risk—“a life measured in years he could no longer comprehend” slightly echoes preceding clause—but does not obscure causality or dull closure image, so kept within minor range.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density: single sentences braid sensory data, metaphor, and interior tilt (“a slick, iridescent comma of emerald and black”). Figurative layering is patterned and paid off—the feather as punctuation ends the poem-sentence. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stance. One mixed metaphor (“wound in the grey canvas”) is minor against overall music.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.3)
    Line craft is spare yet textured: each sentence advances either wire placement or bodily decay, eliminating scaffold. Metaphors are geological-botanical hybrids—“life so patient it was mistaken for geology”—that never violate physical logic. No loops or synonym churn; repetition (“each wrap was tight”) serves incantatory pattern-building. The final paragraph’s single-sentence beats (“He closed the book, and then he closed his eyes”) create a dying cadence that feels inevitable rather than algorithmic.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (anchors setting, reveals character, advances causality). No loops or scaffold; “bronze quiet” appears once and recurs only as transformed concept at exit. Metaphors are coherent: bronze dust→bronze quiet→foundation; no mixed vehicles. One near-purple line (“existential vertigo of First Contact”) is saved by being framed as Aris’s sarcastic internal air-quote. Final third is clean; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, metaphoric charge, and causal push (“He took a pinch of dark loam... and began to fertilize the crack”). Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Micro-loop check clean: no paraphrase redundancies or template cadences. One hairline slip: “sterile water” appears twice; the repetition is minor but keeps the category from perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero template cadence or synonym loops; sentences vary from fragment (“A single, decisive thump.”) to rolling fungal glow line. Figurative choices (“map of a world that no longer was”) stay physical, never purple. Density high—every line advances image, action, or tone; no filler exposition. Proofing clean, pronoun paths clear.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry triple duty—e.g., “the charcoal gritty between her fingers as she began to draw” tells texture, action, and emotional anchor in one stroke. No paraphrase loops, no synonym churn, no scaffold. Metaphors are coherent: “tide pool” for time, “old recording” for stretched perception, all paid off in the crystalline image. Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line recharges the silence motif. Only micro-slip: “the universe tore open for her” edges toward the grandiose, but the next sentence grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; figurative language (“tooth of glacial ice,” “sprites of emerald and gold”) is selective, never congesting the climb or swap beats. One minor scaffold—“the light fractured through an intricate prism, exploding into a thousand dancing sprites”—repeats sensory explosion, but clarity and causality remain intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “tears…paths through grime” does double descriptive and moral work. No mixed metaphors; obsidian board holds literal and symbolic logic. Final line ends on sonic image—“groan that echoed”—that propels closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Density is surgical—“labyrinthine bookstore, a universe of paper and dust carved into a mountain” does world, scale, and metaphor in one breath. Sentence variety propels: participial opening, em-dash insert, final monosyllabic punch. Clean copy; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet musical: “frozen a laughing milkmaid mid-step” packs visual, emotional, and symbolic data. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent—chess, weaving, storm—without mixed vehicles. One hairline slip: “physical weight” is slightly redundant, but it occurs early and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: one sentence can plant seed, reveal status threat, and foreshadow acoustic payoff (“Sound is a seed… a sin… a need”). No scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors consistent—bone/spire/cage motif clusters around ossification vs growth. Read-aloud rhythm varied; enjambed echoes create musical refrain without template cadence. Copy clean; pronoun “it” always antecedents to spire or hush. No mixed metaphors. Closure line (“her questions would never truly die”) delivers crisp, inevitable cadence that re-energizes opening image.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops. High information density: “kintsugi intentions” is defined by enacted method, not exposition. Metaphors are coherent—acid sea, quilted memories—without mixed vehicle violations. Final line “exhaled a story” is crisp, propulsive closure; no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “salt-laced wind whispered out from its depths” does triple sensory duty. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, motive, or choice. Mixed metaphors avoided; figurative language spikes only at pressure points (mirror crack, shell drop) and serves the emotional crest. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from trudging spondees in the tunnel to liquid iambs in the cavern, mirroring descent and release.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm flexes with scene breath; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors stay coherent (held breath released = air; bruise = color) without mixed-vehicle collisions. Information density is high: one sentence often layers scent-memory, lens lore, and intent. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested and propulsive; minor opportunity to trim adjectives “predawn bruise of purple and indigo” to shave one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: scavenged parts, moon phase rule, and emotional stakes packed into single clauses. Rhythm breathes—long sentence for wind moan, short burst for click of bronze. One mixed metaphor “starlight felt solid” is allowed under lyric license and is immediately grounded. Zero paraphrase loops or filter-verb clutter; closing line “raw solace…enough” is spare yet resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: one-sentence micro-paragraphs (“The storm broke at dawn”) act as valve releases. No synonym loops or scaffold; “truth” appears only when dramatized. Metaphors are controlled—eye as “guardian,” orchard as “fractured grace”—and do not clot the climax. Opening and closing lines bookend with sonic echo (storm / quiet). Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean and image-dense: “pale, ghostly fungi… pulsing with a soft, blue-green light” does three jobs—visual, emotional, symbolic—without modifiers stacking. Figurative language is sparse and precise; when metaphor appears (“patience of a glacier”) it is apt to character. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase; each sentence advances position, time, or perception. Final line lands cleanly on an auditory image that reverses the opening urgency into calm.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: climb uses stubbed sentences for breath, grotto elongates with liquid sibilants. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphor is precise—“celestial tears” is worn by the drip action, not decorative. Final line lands clean, no filter-verb clutter: “We are going down” carries the weight of chosen burden.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty (action + concept), rhythm breathes with beats, no filler. Figurative layer is dense but patterned early (“scientifically romantic”) and pays off at closure. One tiny scaffold—“the precise timeframe she’d often tried…”—could trim three words, yet momentum never stalls. Clean grammar, strong verbs, audible read-aloud flow.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: “charcoal stick crumbled against the fragile grain” does three jobs—sound, texture, metaphor. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentences vary length with breath of flight. One mixed metaphor (“triage… artistry”) is minor. Clean copy beyond one comma splice. Read-aloud rhythm lifts during ascent then steadies, mirroring content.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean, high-density lines; figurative language is selective and paid off (“liquid heartbeats” echoes in final breath). No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Strong verbs—“scuttled,” “scuttling,” “recalibrated”—replace modifiers. Paragraph cuts are surgical; removing any would delete knowledge or charge. Minor scaffold: “trembling calm” is repeated verbatim in prompt echo; does not touch closure, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero scaffold loops; sentences vary opening and length. High density: “lattice of old pains and future fears” does triple descriptor duty. Metaphor vehicles logically consistent— storm breath, frost lattice— and payoff at closure. No filter-verb stacks; actions stay in strong verbs. Minor elevated diction (“receding thunderheads”) fits scholar POV and is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm accelerates with the hum—short percussive clauses mimic vibration—then exhales once the scent fades. No filter-verb clusters; “he felt everything” is earned by the prior sensory cascade. Metaphors are controlled: “dying embers” for notes is extended physically by the blue spark, so vehicles cohere. Only minor scaffold: “the weight in his chest was different, lighter” could compress to “his chest felt lighter,” but it does not touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety is wide; participial openers (“Moving…, cradling…, peeling…”) propel rather than stall. Metaphors are few but coherent—“tapestry of What Was”—and never clash. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacking. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line fuses image and cost. Minor elevation in register (“plenitude of resolution”) is earned by context, not drift.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “the station humming with potential energy” does double duty as atmosphere and foreshadowing. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image, emotion, or knowledge. Metaphors are coherent—clocks as membranes, shoreline of time—without mixed vehicles. Opening and final lines act as resonant brackets. Only one near-repeat: “quiet” appears in first and last sentence, but the echo is purposeful, earning its return.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: clauses lengthen during contemplation, shorten at button press. High information density—each sentence advances motive, tool, or atmosphere. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“its faint echo finally reached the cavern’s depths”) that recharges earlier birdsong cue.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences do double duty: “dog-eared racing forms, pawn shop receipts, and a single, strange inheritance” packs backstory, character, and prop in one line.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty: “chemical covenant between her craft and the lost memory” marries process + stakes. Figurative layer is rich but patterned—tea-dark bath, bruised evening—each returns with payoff, avoiding purple drift. No scaffold loops; pronouns clean. Minor cadence echo: “the weight of… / the weight of…” in open/close, but it functions as resonant bookend, not monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: clipped clauses during roof-fix, lengthened cadence for guitar ripple. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or motive. Metaphors are spare and precise—“soft thud of moss on brick”—never stacked. One micro-loop: “the story spread…twisting and changing” could compress to “the story twisted,” but it occupies a single line and does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length to mimic sonic waves. Metaphors are consistent—sound as texture, grief as dissonance—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often maps terrain, advances plot, and shades emotion. Final line “quiet blaze” is crisp, non-clichéd, recharges earlier “quiet blaze of concentration.”

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density—each sentence advances premise or emotional calculus. Metaphors are spare and precise: ‘temporal crease’, ‘cascade of new, unpredictable consequences’. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; only minor simultaneity slip (‘as he nudged… showing him’). Clean punctuation and tense. Final paragraph could trim one adjective (‘profound stillness’) without loss, keeping it from top band.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; clauses breathe with the tide. Figurative language is selective—moonlight as cathedral, crane as ghost—never stacked in crisis beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. A single mixed vehicle (“aggressive silence…pushed back against the moonlight”) is forgiven because the personification charges the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Varied rhythm mirrors breath: long sentence for descent, staccato for detonation. Information density high—“star-nosed mole... claws shaped with her characteristic impatience” packs world, artist-hand, and clue in one clause. Metaphors stay consistent (volcanic, cosmic, archival) and never mix violently. Zero loops, no scaffold; “dust-choked silence” is the only stock phrasing but is forgiven in opening anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm modulates from stealth hush to percussive crescendo without algorithmic repetition. Figurative language is selective: “braided into marrow,” “metallic flora,” each image serving atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Final line lands on a quiet cadence that lets the lagoon’s glow echo.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud cadence is controlled: syntax tightens during descent and drawer release. Figurative language is spare—"aurora’s sickly green tendrils"—and kept from purple overload. One scaffold loop: "pull a small, worn object… pulled out his final tool" repeats "pull" stem within six lines, a minor drum. Otherwise, high density, zero typos, prop clarity flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet aerodynamic—each sentence layers image, motion, and metaphor ("wet ink under a bruised sky"). No loops or scaffold; figurative control stays coherent even in peak beat ("firefly sighing its last"). Rhythm accelerates subtly as shutter-slits narrow, then exhales when the light dives. Register remains elevated but consistent with mythic guardian voice; no cluttered micro-movements.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean and rhythmic with selective metaphor—”bottom of a frozen sea,” “pawn bravely advanced.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Information density is high: one sentence often layers setting, interiority, and stake. The warming stone image recharges earlier lodestone logic without overwriting, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentence slips from coiling nets to societal outlawing of conflict. No synonym loops or scaffold; verbs are muscular (flowed, stomped, coiled). Metaphors are spare and functional: “dancer among grunting laborers,” “watery threshold.” Rhythm breathes—short tag line “A very safe, very sturdy cage” stands alone after longer flow. Grammar clean, pronoun tracking flawless; only micro-repeat “he” cluster mid-detach, not enough to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: each sentence layers job (action + sensory cue + emotional valence). No synonym churn; “whump-whump-whump” repeat is pattern-taught and pays off as monstrous heartbeat. Figurative language is spare and accurate (“island in a sea of noise,” “skeletal forest”). Only micro-flaw: occasional adjective pairing “crisp, silent testament” edges toward elegance, but restrained to one per beat. Read-aloud rhythm alternates fluidly between ceremonial roll and staccato carving beats.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: each sentence layers sensation, metaphor, and information without scaffolding. Figurative language sustains mineral/music motif without mixed metaphors. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts purposeful. Micro undercuts: one near-coincidence of “silence” thrice in 40 words; negligible. Read-aloud ear test passes; momentum breathes with Kael’s surrender rather than stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; high information density—each sentence advances plant cipher, object craft, or emotional stakes. Rhythm varies: short surgical sentence for glass sealing, then elongated clause for note’s sustain. Metaphors stay physically coherent (glass “shimmering like Vex’s finest glass”). No scaffold, no synonym churn, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lyrically dense yet information-rich: single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and conceptual data. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (light as lattice, sound as pilgrim path). One mixed metaphor blip—“journey not across land but through silent canyons of archived data”—but it is early and doesn’t obtrude closure. Peak beat (“the bell answered…glowed from within”) is clean, vivid, unadorned. Minor tightening possible on adjective pairs, but momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between polisher’s circular cadence and the origami’s crisp imperative verbs, mirroring action. No paraphrase loops; each image advances either emotional pressure or spatial clarity. Metaphors are clean: “curtains of intention” extends logically to “lens” and “beam.” High-density lines (“Inside, he wrote a set of celestial coordinates…”) carry three jobs—object handling, motive reveal, and foreshadowing. Only nit: “timeless observatory” is slightly cliché diction amid otherwise fresh choices—doesn’t touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are coherent—rain as “momentary lens,” tape as “graph of social velocity”—and stay within POV lexicon. No register drift. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line delivers closure image that recharges “great and terrible.” Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, propulsive; paragraph cuts are crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Varied sentence lengths create ritual pulse. Metaphors (“tomb of wonders,” “sublimated into memory”) are precise and non-contradictory. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested: anchor voice and re-charge the veil/reflection motif.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from murmured sibilance to crisp percussive clicks during the fitting beat. No filter-verb clusters; noun-verb pairs stay specific ("coaxed...onto his hand," "tail curling with tentative...grace"). One mixed metaphor—"swirling ghost" beside "silver glow"—but it occurs early and does not recur near closure. High information density without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers sensory, emotional, or symbolic information. No filler loops or scaffold; mixed metaphors kept coherent (“archipelago on the paper sea”). Only minor register lift—“codified,”“conceptual repricing”—slightly above POV norm, but justified by his clinical obsession. Final line lands with imagistic snap.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variation is orchestral; no scaffold or loop detected. Information density high—single lines deliver scent, emotion, and world-rule. Metaphors stay physically coherent; “love seeped into the plush red velvet” keeps vehicle and tenor congruent. Final cadence slows to match solemn reverence, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: long anaphoric sentences for cosmic drift, then staccato fragments at the reveal. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—static as smothering blanket, stardust as forgotten hymn; no mixed metaphors. Information density high: “brass-smudged fingers and starlight” does tactile-visual double duty. Only micro-loop: “unspoken words…silent hum…unspoken resentments” in paragraph one; adjacent restatement costs a tenth.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero scaffolding or paraphrase loops; each sentence does dual duty (image + causality). Figurative language sparse and precise: “glowing dune in bloom with ghost-pale flora” marries sight and lifecycle metaphor without strain. No register drift; technical terms earned by world. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges chess-clock motif. Varied sentence rhythm; paragraph cuts land on tactical pivots. Clean grammar; pronoun reference unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates from long dusk-sentences to clipped final step, no template cadence. Figurative layer is spare—one lighthouse-firefly, one harbor-calm—never overwrought. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. “Held an imprint: a single, perfect star stamp” is dense, tactile, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is near-flawless: high information density, zero loops, strong verbs (“whisper of snow,” “sheared bolt-head glint”). Figurative control maintained even at closure—no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“seraphically mundane”) is voice-motivated. Opening and final lines both earn their keep; no scaffold sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; no looped stems or synonym churn. Metaphors are spare and consistent—“phantom river,” “borrowed light”—no mixed vehicles. One minor scaffold: “a carefully constructed lie woven into the fabric of history” could compress, but it occurs early and doesn’t dull closure. Opening and closing images (silent feet → silent echo) create elegant bookends.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: “the sun bled into the horizon” does double duty for time and wound. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; “towering structures of coral, vibrant with shades of magenta and electric blue” is precise, not purple. Opening line anchors both voice and stake; closing line crystallizes the new mission. One micro-slip: “indifferent blue” appears twice—acceptable echo, but keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: “dust from dormant gantries” packs noun-adjective economy; no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors disciplined—“dark sun-rays” for scorch marks—physical logic intact. Rhythm varies: short beat “She knelt” gives way to flowing harmonic sentence that actually swells on tongue. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensorial or causal information. Copy clean: pronouns stable, tense consistent, no homophone slips. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases image that echoes first light bleed. Only hairline slip: “testament to its fizzled-out energy” is slightly editorial, but sentence moves on quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with tension: short sentences at fracture moment—“A network of hairline fractures…”—counterpoint earlier lush description. No scaffold or synonym loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphor density peaks only at closure where it is earned. Opening and final lines act as resonant bookends without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“ice bloomed in her stomach”—no mixed metaphors. High information density: “automated beam of the new lighthouse” locates era and isolation in five words. No artifacts in final third; closure image remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences do two jobs (image + interiority). Minor loop: “luminescent ache” is repeated verbatim twice within fifty words. Metaphors stay coherent—spiral staircase echoed in spiral of fragments—no mixed vehicles. Charcoal dust, hemp fiber, and cracked leather give tangible specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet limber: each sentence layers image, motion, and concept without paraphrase loops. Metaphors (“syrupy stretching of time”) extend consistently from rock-and-ink physics. Rhythm accelerates into the disappearance beat, then snaps to white-space silence. Only hairline slip: “internal light” is vague amid otherwise razor-sharp sensory catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs; sentences vary; no loops or paraphrase churn. Strong verbs and nouns dominate. A single mixed metaphor (“ghost in the machine” beside “whisper of ventilation”) is minor. Momentary filter-verb cluster (“felt a pang”) but immediacy recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences multi-task: “sun bled…curved panes” sets scene + stakes in one breath. No paraphrase loops; metaphors consistent (dome = etched quiet, rose = secret). Only minor scaffold: “a time of flight and folly” could compress. Final blade-sheath sentence is propulsive, sonic. Clean grammar; pronouns unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variance strong—parallel anaphora kept for ritual cadence, then broken at strike. Information density high: “shattering a nearby sculpture of a forgotten melody into a million tinkling shards” does world/rule/texture triple duty. Only micro-loop: “was beginning/ began to” twice in opening paragraph; not repeated in climax, so −0.1. No mixed metaphor; physical logic of anti-sound holds. Final line anchors echo in verb “heal,” giving satisfying close without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentences advance plot, character, and metaphor (“rosewood nib…old blood”). Rhythm accelerates during phone duel via short, punchy questions. Zero synonym loops or template cadence. Metaphors (satellites of sorrow, star-dusted velvet) stay coherent and scene-anchored. Opening and final lines echo orbital motion, creating lyrical bookend. One near-purple line—“kingdom of ink and pulp”—but it pays off thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: each sentence moves—either advances star-map, anchors guilt, or translates firmware. Rhythm accelerates during etching beat, then halts with *Papa*. One soft scaffold: “the state he understood best” slightly explains what line already shows (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; figurative control tight.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong information density: each sentence layers sensory, conceptual, or emotional cargo. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles stay coherent—“silence as symptom” sustains medical trope without drift. Line propulsion breathes with scene; paragraph cuts land on image pivots. One minor scaffold: “This was her argument against the void” summarizes what the mandala already dramatizes—−0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences breathe with varied cadence; no template churn or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse—“web of crystalline fractures,” “arms of steel”—each image tied to concrete stakes. Information density is high: a single sentence slips world-burn, Kaelen’s mission, and tactile cue. The only micro-drag is “the patterns were not damage; they were a circuit board,” a slight over-explanation that costs −0.2 but does not touch the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythmic control: long breathless sentences for echo-stacking, then short “He saw…” beats for release. Information density high—each sentence layers time, sense, emotion. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (rust-note, cider-sparkle). Only minor scaffold: “a sudden, inexplicable warmth” could lose “inexplicable” without loss; –0.2. Closure line “gentle, contented silence” lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative choices (“spun glass,” “shattering ice”) are sparse, apt, and never mixed. Strong verbs—“lunged,” “slashed,” “blossoming”—propel without adverb clutter. Final line lands clean, no scaffolding, earning the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong information density: one sentence projects color field, encodes emotion, advances motion. No filter-verb clusters; verbs are kinetic—“whirred,” “coalesced,” “surged.” Figurative layer is restrained until peak beat, where metaphor (“symphony of sensations”) is earned by prior sensory layering. Minor scaffold: “the sensor display flickered wildly” could tighten to “sensor display flickered,” but artifact does not touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm modulates cleanly; no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is spare and purposeful—“canyon echo,” “knot of tangled history”—never stacks into purple. Information density high: one sentence often fuses sensory detail, world rule, and emotional tilt. Clean copy, zero typos.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or filler; each sentence carries double duty—e.g., “The world was reduced…promise of spring” layers weather, mood, and thematic tilt in one breath. Figurative control: mist “silver hush,” footprints “softening,” purpose “sharp enough to cut glass” —three metaphors, each precise, never stacked. Paragraph rhythm breathes with beats—long sentence for mood, fragment for crunch of snow, staccato for code transmission. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, no editorial commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.3)
    Every sentence performs at least two jobs: “Its lamps carving feeble holes in the soupy white” anchors time, signals diminished agency, and introduces the visual motif of penetration. Metaphors are lean, precise, and coherent: fog as “slow-boiling tar,” needle as “anchor” for memory—no mixed vehicles. No loops or scaffold; even the repeated “promise” accrues new laminations each time. Final line—“ready to move forward”—is monosyllabic release after long Latinate clauses, ear-perfect cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    Every sentence advances image or pressure; no paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Figurative language is spare and grounded—“the world had been fired into a brittle, grey ceramic”—metaphors obey physical logic of kiln and desert. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for slow heat, abrupt fragments when visions flare. Line-level density is high yet translucent; no mis-cued simultaneity, no buried leads. Closure beat is immaculate: “profound silence…quiet not of emptiness, but of peace,” a final line that reprises smoke-flatten motif without repeating it.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between long tidal flows and short pulse beats that mirror the pendulum. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances either tactic or sensory state. Figurative language is spare and coherent—mixed-metaphor risk avoided. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is dense and musical: “a place woven from mist and starlight above a sea of forgotten clouds.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence adds image or pressure. Figurative control holds—mirrors do not shatter under extended metaphor. Opening and final lines are anchor and echo. One near-purple phrase (“cataclysm of the soul”) but forgiven by context.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is near-flawless: high density, zero loops, no mixed metaphors. Each sentence advances image or stake—“droplets clung…like tiny, clear jewels” compresses setting, symbolism, and her jeweler-like attention. Rhythm accelerates into the final release without scaffold. One microscopic filter verb cluster (“she felt”) is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy. Read-aloud ear test passes at literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is lean and propulsive; figurative language is rationed, each image (airlock finality, jagged edge sanded smooth) earns its place. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; information density remains high—every paragraph advances stake, tool, or atmosphere. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, bookending the piece with tactile radio metaphors. A single fused participle (“Spending a new chart…”) is a negligible seam.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but propulsive: one sentence delivers setting, stake, and sensory cue (“damp earth and ozone”). No loops or synonym churn; metaphors (“skeletal ruin,” “silent sentinels”) are spare and coherent. Peak-beat clarity survives the sonic-betrayal paragraph because figurative language is anchored to tangible motion—floor buckles, walls breathe. Opening and final lines create a sonic bracket: “bone and shadow” vs. “storm of sound and stone,” recharging motif without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances palette, mist, or emotional stakes. Metaphors are spare and consistent (“wound in the earth,” “canvas wound”). Rhythm modulates: long painterly cadences contract to two-word slash clause at climax. No mixed vehicles or filter-verb stacks; information density high without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful: “sky-river’s child” teaches micro-vortex concept early. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Copy-clean: tense stable, pronouns unambiguous, no scaffold hedges.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (anchors setting, characterizes, advances). No loops or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Peak-beat clarity: “first note hung…question mark of impossible hope” is clean, not overwrought. Minor scaffolding: “the” used three times in successive sentence openers once—does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; high-density lines (“fluorescent vests an insult to the muted greens and browns”) do double duty. Zero loops, no mixed metaphors. Final line’s “quiet, dusky harmony” re-uses opening phrase for pattern payoff, not redundancy. One near-slip: “predatory smile of a different kind of robber” edges toward over-figurative, but fits POV.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm varies from iambic astronomic cadence to heartbeat monosyllables; paragraph cuts land on image-turns, never redundant. Density high: copper/solace, dust/petals, telegram/curse each do double duty. Zero loops; no scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—“cold copper...solace” is tactile, not thermal; “ideograms” literal in dream frame. Only hairline artifact: two successive sentences open “He...” mid-dream; pattern taught by stress, so forgiven. Copy clean; no typos, tense drift, or buried lead.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“silent scream” blossoms, “obsidian glass” water—taught early and paid off. One mixed metaphor risk (“orchard vortex”) is immediately anchored by physical description, preserving clarity. Final line lands with cadence shift and emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and world data (“ozone and night-blooming moonpetals” sets both scent and alien ecology). Figurative language is controlled; no mixed metaphors. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she felt… she saw… she knew”) in the Kael link beat keeps it from 9+ band. Otherwise clean, propulsive, and read-aloud fluent.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Density is high—“phosphorescent moss on the ceiling casting long, skeletal shadows” does three jobs in nine words. No loops, no mixed metaphors; rhythm accelerates during the shadow attack, then exhales with the scraping root. Final line lands on a resonant monosyllabic beat: “one piece at a time.”

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: each sentence advances memory or object state; no scaffold. Varied sentence openings; no template cadence. Metaphors are grounded (“fortress of facts”) and consistent with audio imagery; no mixed vehicles. Zero loops, zero filter-verb stacks. Paragraph cuts are purposeful; removing the ripping beat would gut momentum. Proofing clean. Final line offers cadence shift that recharges “echo valley.”</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Premise—ex-roadie appraising antiques while excavating his own wreck—offers fresh angle on post-fame grief. Grille cloth as emotional relic is specific; not transferable to any object without loss. Transformation feels inevitable because the cloth’s worthless-yet-priceless status is seeded early. Risk lies in quiet ending, but Charged Poise justifies it; still, band-implosion trope is familiar, capping originality just below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero scaffold or synonym loops; each sentence advances image, physics, or stakes. Mixed metaphors forbidden—magnetic field and waveform language stay coherent. High information density: “collapsed star” seed packs mass, death, and potential in two words. Final line cadence mirrors arbor hum, achieving sonic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Varied sentence rhythm: long tidal sentences crash against staccato “metallic chime.” Information density high—single sentence delivers salt patterns, sensor catalog, moon phase, world rule. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or charge. Metaphors (bone moon, starlight fish) are precise, non-contradictory. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence modulates with tide rise and emotional heat. One microscopic cliché shard (“great, slow breath”) keeps from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong read-aloud variation; sentences lengthen/desugar under awe, then fracture during hesitation. Figurative control: only two metaphors in climax, both coherent (light “thick as honey,” crystal “heart”). No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Minor over-modification in opening (“colossal quartz formations…frozen note”) but cleared before peak beat. Information density high—each sentence advances motive, setting, or object state.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “rawness he hadn’t known since... stopped the medication” does triple duty (time, cause, bodily stakes). Metaphors (sandpaper, broken lung) are purposeful and few; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for river memory, staccato for station entry. Zero paraphrase loops; accordion left behind, not re-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, physics rule, emotional voltage—without scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (ozone, star-death, haptic tremor), zero paraphrase loops, and the backward-sweep of syntax literally enacts the time mechanic while maintaining crystal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud cadence is deliberate but never mechanical; sentence openings vary; no synonym churn. One job per sentence: description, motion, metaphor, or consequence. Metaphors stay inside physical logic—light as liquid, not as random fireworks. Zero loops, zero scaffold, zero purple; density peaks in the three-line infusion without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“vineyard hush”) and paid off in final hush of thriving purpose. Sentences carry dual load—e.g., “sluggish water found its new path” advances both plot and metaphor. One microscopic cliché slip: “pulse a soft, faltering rhythm” is mildly familiar; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent: ember “surrendered its ghost,” cloak “billowing like fallen king’s banner”—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: “hollow mirror shard, edges worn smooth by sea and desperate hands” does triple job (object, backstory, theme). Rhythm modulates: opening lyrical, tightening to shard climax, easing into quiet payoff. No scaffold; “cheap whiskey” and “salt-eaten iron” supply tactile specificity without modifier bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor. Sentence rhythm accelerates then collapses with the rings. High density: “rough fabric of his tunic scraping against the stone's crystalline surface” layers tactile, visual, and sonic data in one stroke. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“shimmering,” “contracted”) replace modifiers. Final line “quiet potential” is a crisp, resonant closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is densely polyphonic: one sentence often layers metaphor, sensory cue, and causal push (“The wind, a patient sculptor, had peeled back a layer of grit...”). No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; volcanic glass / bone tower logic stays coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“acoustic heart,” “psychic one”) is voice-motivated and brief, not purple. Final third is clean—no artifact touches closure—so 9+ gate stays open; only minor scaffold in the repeated “pulse/echo” coupling prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentence does three jobs—“heavy pack slid from his back and landed with a muffled thud in the thin layer of snow, a heap of useless complexity.” No loops, no scaffold. Metaphors are precise: “bruised plum” for sky, “poet forced to write legal code” for misalignment. One stanza of elevated diction (“lingering luminance”) is earned by archaic stone, not register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean but imagistic; every clause advances atmosphere or emotional pressure—no filler. Metaphors stay consistent (lamps=stars, books=bats) and serve theme without crowding. One near-loop: “lights…lights” in open could compress, but cadence justifies echo. High information density; opening line anchors both voice and stakes immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from staccato bursts to the long sentence that releases the orchestra. Information density high: one sentence often performs world, body, and stake. Zero paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Only hairline slip: “the familiar grip of stellar doubt” leans label-adjacent, but immediately embodied by finger on console.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; figurative language is disciplined—each metaphor (sun “bled out,” crystal “webbed with fractures”) returns to the naming conceit. Sentence rhythm breathes with ritual pacing; no overwriting even in the high-stakes crystallization beat.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is assured; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Figurative language is selective, never more than one image per high-pressure sentence, avoiding density penalty. No paraphrase loops; “plink, plink” is purposeful onomatopoeic pattern, not artifact. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“a tiny circle of impossible moisture”).

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: “reservoir’s water had receded like a sick man’s gums” performs simile, world rule, and stakes in one. No filler loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or pressure. Final line—“mirrored hush…filled…with understanding”—reuses opening image with recharged meaning, satisfying pattern payoff. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean yet lyric, each sentence双层 duty (scent of ancient ice and new blossoms compresses time). Zero loops; no mixed metaphors. Minor density spike in “thousand dancing rainbows” but pattern is taught early and paid off in vapor shimmer, so remains beneath artifact penalty threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm breathes with pressure: longer sensory sentences in calm, then staccato clauses (“Click, pull, check.”) as tremor calms. Information density high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and technical data without scaffold. No mixed metaphors; “stone in gut” stays geological, “weight of silence” stays acoustic. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; each image appears once and recedes.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long, river-stone clauses and blade-short fragments, mirroring the yin-yang pulse. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse but precise (“mind a similar collection of disconnected particles”). High information density: each sentence advances setting, character, and concept simultaneously. Final line lands on monosyllabic tremor that recharges “numbness” with new weight.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates: longer brook-mimic sentences early, shorter beats under lamp and database, then calm cadence for planting. No template cadence; sentence openings vary. Information density high—each paragraph advances motive, clue, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and precise: “storm-born silence,” “living contract,” no mixed metaphors. No synonym churn or paraphrase loops; “orthogonal approaches” appears once and is enacted. Copy-clean: tense stable, pronouns clear, punctuation conventional. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. Micro-movements (“filled it with a precise mixture…”) serve tactile immediacy, not puppet-master externality.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: each sentence layers action + sound + metaphor (“the engine screamed to life, a deafening, atonal blast that ripped through the home’s stillness”). No filter-verb stacks or scaffold loops; only one participial opener and it tracks logically. Metaphors stay coherent—wind as symphony, roar as speech, shredded leaves as grief—without crowding peak beat. Final line offers a sonic after-image (“the roar of his symphony softened”) that resolves rhythm and theme simultaneously. A lone near-cliché (“single tear”) is saved by its physical wind-caused catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; high-pressure portal beat deploys participle fragments without simultaneity errors. Figurative language sparing and coherent: “watercolor in rain,” no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “days turned into a featureless cycle” could compress to “days cycled featurelessly,” but it does not stall momentum. Closure line “He had made his peace with the fog” lands clean, no overwritten flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence can world-build (“ley lines fizzled into warm, ashen dust”) while revealing character kinship. Figurative language is selective—mixed metaphor patrol finds none; vehicles stay physical and coherent. Minor template cadence in paragraph 5 (“he had… he had…”) is the only loop, but it occurs mid-structure, not at closure, so 9+ is not disallowed. Final line lands with monosyllabic punch: “just beginning”—a deliberate deceleration that recharges opener “a place of endings.”

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences do triple duty: “serenely electric, charged with cosmic dust and ghost-whispers” fuses setting, tone, and character belief in one breath. No loops, no synonyms; each metaphor extends the same acoustic axis. Only one near-muddle: “swollen pearl” is faintly cliché, but it is instantly refracted through her instrument-panel gaze, so momentum survives.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “slide out of reality, like a bead of water skittering off a waxed leaf” compresses transition and sensory analogy in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances choice or texture. Figurative language is sparse but precise—moonlight-walled grotto, spectral starlight—no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested; final “sailor forever caught between shores” lands as a rhythmic, thematic chime without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence braids action, tool, and sensory change; no scaffold or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (thread as formula, lattice as map) and do not invade high-pressure beat. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, rhythm varied. Zero typos, tense stable, pronoun clean. Registers remain within Elias’s lexicon—“pearlescent,” “moire”—without thesaurus drift.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear test: variety in sentence openings, paragraph lengths breathe. Density high—single sentences layer metaphor, world-fact, emotional tilt (“relic from a surface world most of his students had never seen”). No scaffold loops; only one near-paraphrase (“quiet, somber marvel”) already flagged. Metaphor vehicles ( trenches, mountain ranges) stay consistent with geologist-navigator mind. Opening line anchors voice/stakes; final line releases image. Proof: “phosphorescent barnacles” not capitalized, consistent; zero typos.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; strategic repetition (“reeling hush”) is pattern-taught and paid off. Metaphors are spare and coherent—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “the only tool he needed” + “the only sound” echo same opener; not severe enough to dull closure. One paraphrase loop: “a technician of sorrow and his job was to close the circuit” could compress, but at 759 words the density is otherwise high.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense without scaffold: “concrete wound,” “fossilized leviathans,” “probability wave” each carry double duty. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no loops or synonym churn. Final clause “only the hush” is a deliberate cadence shift that recharges motif; minor −0.1 for two successive participle openers mid-paragraph that could imply simultaneity, but clarity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies from long fluid lines to staccato pulse-counts, matching scene temperature. No filter-verb clusters; ink, shard, and snow are shown through action. One mixed metaphor—“starless-night ink”—reads intentional and paid off by the void-star inversion. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal data.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances texture or sound. Metaphors organic—“river of black ink”—without muddle. High density: vertebra=word, grit=phrase. Final line recharges opening loneliness with earned reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose pulses: sentence length varies from lyrical spiral to clipped realization. Density high—“soil under her nails and the placid, unnerving silence of a forest after a fire” does three jobs. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “strange herbs and stranger silences” is near-paraphrase but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; most sentences carry dual duty (action + sensory hit). Mixed-metaphor vigilance finds none; metaphor vehicles stay consistent (music = wave, shell = key, orchard = bruise-womb). One minor paraphrase loop—“beauty…beauty”—in final paragraph, not at climax, clipped −0.2. Rhythm breathes with scene: languid bow draws vs. cracked flagstones. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; final line recharges shell/heartbeat motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences perform double duty (“The dust…clung…a second skin of grit and compromise” simultaneously sets scene and character). Metaphors are coherent and necessary; no mixed vehicles, no paraphrase loops. One clause of overwriting—“impossible silver lightning” could be sharper—but it occurs pre-climax and does not touch the final image, so the 9-band gate remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence either advances carving progress or escalates atmospheric pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stake in one motion: “Elias, the silent carousel carpenter, had found the train by taking a wrong turn.” Metaphors are spare and physically coherent—“spun moonlight” is the only figurative stretch, justified by fragment’s appearance. Rhythmic variation matches wind crescendo; final paragraph lengthens to sustain the sung note. No line could be removed without collapsing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: each sentence advances image or causality. No scaffold loops; metaphors (scarf as window, library as manifold) stay coherent. One mixed metaphor—“color of a drying wound” beside “memories worn thin”—minor, does not touch closure. Sentence variety supports propulsion; no drumbeat cadence. Clean grammar and tense. Minor overwrite in “quiet cathedral of shelved paradoxes” but within tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from short tripod-clicks to long fluid light-spills, never falling into template cadence. Figurative language is disciplined: every metaphor is optical (prismatic haze, pearlescent glow) and stays in the photonic register. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances plate, palette, or emotional ledger. Only the phrase “luminous absence” repeats once; its second deployment gains conceptual cost, forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety is strong; openings avoid algorithmic patterns. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors in the climax beat, both (“filament of spun glass,” “ghost of a melody”) concrete and non-contradictory. One scaffold trace: “a beautiful, terrible thing” is abstract filler just before the lattice appears; it survives because immediacy resumes. No loops, no register drift; ozone and salt carry tactile specificity. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural cadence shifts under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences do double duty: “ghostly green tableau” paints atmosphere while labeling the orchard’s uncanny vitality. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends the submersile/archaeological frame. One mixed image—“jagged corona” applied to shipwrecks—barely grazes coherence but doesn’t blur the final beat. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“he looked”) they serve the telescope gaze motif.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and interior tilt (“His long, scarred fingers traced the lines left by the moisture and dregs”). Rhythm modulates from languid opening clauses to staccato charcoal-scratch verbs. Minor scaffold: “then another” repeated in retreat beat; does not dull closure. No mixed metaphors; mirror-shard skin and tea-geometry share consistent fragility motif.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with waterfall cadence; sentence openings vary, no template runs. Information dense: single sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and mythic work (“dark as polished obsidian but humming with a latent energy”). One paraphrase loop detected: “slow leaching of vibrancy” echoes “creeping greyness” within two sentences—minor −0.2. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay liquid/light-consistent. Final line lands with image, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathy sentences for starlight, clipped fragments during knot tension. No synonym loops; “knot,” “rope,” “strand” are necessary technical repeats. Metaphor density high but patterned—sea, ceramic, starlight—paid off in final cold wash. Opening and closing lines bookend with light imagery, achieving cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, high-density; every sentence performs double duty—atmosphere plus causal clue. Metaphors are few but apt: “lichen clung like faded paint,” no mixed vehicles. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; sentence openings vary. One micro-drift: “shielded openness” is abstract coinage, but the concept is immediately embodied through action, so register stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences deliver setting, object, backstory, and emotional tilt. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (spectral sentinels, pale flowers) are sparse and coherent. Final third is clean—no figurative muddle. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line offers resonant image. Minor register lift (“esoteric,” “entropy”) is justified by narrator’s scientific frame.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify, no template cadence. Information density high—each sentence toggles action, object, or atmosphere. No mixed metaphors; “polarized hues” and “scattered light” obey internal physics. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Minor intensifier (“quiet, warmly inquisitive way”) is the only fluff, too slight to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances image or emotional register. Metaphors internally consistent—cloud as fresco, starlight as dust—no mixed vehicles. Information-dense: “high-tensile mooring line snapped with a sound no louder than a sigh” packs cause, sensory detail, and foreshadow. Closure line variegated rhythm: “endless, echoing beauty of what remained” reads as cadence payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; every sentence either advances machinery-hush or decodes the coin. Information density high: dust motes = ticking clock, acid pit = historical violence, all in four words. Metaphor disciplined—vehicles stay physical (grain = star-veins) so the sky remains tactile. Final line “perfect and unending cosmos held within walls about to fall” is a controlled cadence that snaps the universe shut.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density: “charcoal pencil poised over fresh vellum” does three jobs (tool, action, vocation). Mixed-metaphor risk in “ocean of blue” vs “fluid body” of birds is forgiven by cumulative cohesion. No scaffold loops; sentence lengths vary. One near-template cadence: “He began to note…” repeated twice—minor, outside closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Figurative language is patterned early—light as cruelty, frost as skin—and paid off when both shed. Rhythm accelerates across the uncapping beat without sacrificing clarity. Opening and closing lines reverb: twilight → golden morning, driftwood → fulfilled rhythm. Minor lexical illusion “visceral drop” could be more idiomatic, but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, high-density, and largely free of scaffold; only minor template cadence in "They had already… they followed…" type strings. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. A few adjective clusters ("immense, silent rock arches") could be tighter. Closure line is crisp and image-driven. Overall clean with minor hairline slips.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is densely figurative but pattern-taught early (“pane of hush,” “filigree”) and paid off. No mixed metaphors; light-surgery sustains medical precision. One scaffold pair—“He was not a herald… but a purveyor”—is earned thesis, not loop. Final sentence cadence slows to three breaths, mirroring death-momentum; no artifacts touch the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; strong verbs (“shoved,” “thrummed,” “stuttered”) propel. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Information density is high—every clause adds weather, tool, or bodily stakes. Frost image returns reweighted, no clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong sentence variety, no loops or scaffold; metaphors stay within physical logic of foam and polymer science. One minor purple patch (“symphonically minded”) is justified by character vernacular. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the river’s pulse; final paragraph lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet limpid—each sentence advances image or causality without scaffold. Figurative language is selective: “sea of clouds churned in an endless, silent ballet” teaches the orchard’s floating rules early, then recedes. No loops, filter-verb stacks, or mixed metaphors appear; the final incision beat is uncluttered, letting the moonlight pool carry the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyric: “dunes were weeping, their flanks carved into new shapes” compresses time and emotion without filler. Mixed metaphors are avoided; bruised creosote, grinding stones, sandpapered heart form a coherent tactile constellation. One paraphrase loop appears (“rough memories…smooth to cut” / “edges were too smooth to cut”) but occupies separate paragraphs and serves thematic reprise, so minimal deduction. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during avalanche of motes, then exhales cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between staccato code fragments and flowing lyric lines, taught by line 1 and sustained. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse, precise (“metallic teardrop,” “polyphonic chorus”). Opening and closing lines act as framing cadence. Minor filter-verb cluster (“he watched,” “he felt”) but not in peak beat; no clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from long winding clauses to staccato pulses that mimic neural firing. Figurative layer is dense but pattern-taught early (“pages of stone,” “silver ink”) so it pays off at closure. One scaffold phrase “chaotically precise” repeats twice; minor loop, not closure-touching.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence can deliver setting, kinetics, and stakes—“Water droplets…began to fall upwards, clinging to the stone arch like silver pearls.” No scaffold loops; each sentence advances either spatial map or perceptual revelation. Metaphors are consistent—light, inversion, fire—without mixed vehicles. Minor intensifier creep (“lethal,” “breathtaking”) is forgiven because it tracks Kael’s awe. Closing line lands with imagistic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm breathes with the performance: long anacrustic sentences lead to single-beat releases (“a low, resonant C”). No scaffold, no loops; every sentence either advances the sequence of notes or tightens the bodily cost. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“autobiography of tension”—never overwriting the physics of vibration. The final line is an ear-test triumph: five monosyllables that throb (“The world was no longer quiet.”).

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry double duty—information + atmosphere—without scaffold. Figurative language is restrained; when it appears (“ghostly ribbons”) it is accurate to physics of aurora. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for contemplation, staccato for mapped silences. Zero paraphrase loops, synonym churn, or mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines frame and resolve with imagetic precision. Minor tense stability perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with tuning hums; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Metaphors stay physically coherent (foil-bite, sun-warmed stone). Information density high—“copper wires, thin as spun hair” does triple duty (visual, tactile, scale). Only micro-slip: “theatrical sincerity” is named, not shown, but it’s a single phrase and doesn’t stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often carries scent-data, emotional valence, and world lore simultaneously. Mixed-metaphor watch passes—wind as both “riot” and “sighing exhalation” is earned by prior plant-personification. Zero paraphrase loops; each odor note adds new threat information. Minor scaffold: “the thought of the flower’s eventual…stench was a distant storm cloud” repeats the earlier storm-cloud conceit—−0.2, not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences carry dual duty (e.g., “world turned upside down with a grace that defied its own violence” conveys physics miracle and emotional awe). No synonym loops or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates during exit race, mirrors falling droplets. A single instance of slightly ornate “gossamer-fruit” is justified by character occupation; does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    High-density lines ("haze tasted of salt and rust") do triple duty: sensory, world, character. Metaphor strings ("cathedral of stillness") are sparse, pattern-taught early, and payoff in final silence. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. One minor scaffold: "He understood now" could be cut, but it occurs pre-closure and does not dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene temperature; sentence variety and vivid verbs (“bloomed,” “spike,” “dissolved”) propel without scaffolding. Occasional stacked modifiers (“impossible greens and deep violets”) flirt with purple but serve auroral excess by design. No synonym loops or template drums; only minor near-repeats (“oscillating repose” twice) keep it from pristine 9-tier. Overall, high-density, image-driven prose supports rather than smothers the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences vary from sinuous cumulative lines to clipped fragments under pressure; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is spare and precise—“thread of gold…like a captured sliver of sun” condenses artifact and metaphor in one stroke. Information density is high: single sentences deliver guardian history, bodily sensation, and tactical shift. Zero paraphrase loops; each paragraph advances knowledge, intention, or emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong verbs: “plumed,” “shimmered,” “germinate.” No filter stacks; metaphors stay physical (“river of light”). One scaffold risk: “the sound unnervingly loud in the vast silence” could trim to “the sound cracked the vast silence,” but it’s minor. Final sentence cadence lands cleanly. Zero paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“canvas of impossible, feathery detail” condenses visual+texture in one stroke. Strong verbs (sheathing, splashed, screaming) carry load. No mixed metaphors. Grammar clean; tense stable. Final line’s colon delivers closure with snap.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose propels: high density lines carry sensory, emotional, causal work. Mixed metaphors avoided; “hardened light,” “silent nova” stay consistent. One scaffold spot: “wistful ache” and “wistful longing” in open/close—minor loop but doesn’t dull final image. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts purposeful. No artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening pattern; high information density—each clause adds new sensory or causal data. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. The single scaffold-like phrase “the truth landed with its full, crushing weight” is earned by prior sensory layering and thus reads as payoff, not boilerplate. Peak beat prose stays concrete: “hum…screamed, then snapped into silence.”

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear shows varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph cuts. Figurative language is sparse; when it appears (“lighthouse heartbeat”) it is anchored in Silas’s sensory panic. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; “supply skiff, the Tern” is the only proper-noun echo, justified. Information density high—each line layers weather, body, and task. Closure image is uncluttered, letting glass + beam do final lift.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: each sentence advances image, tactic, or atmosphere. Figurative layering is disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Minor template cadence in “He...” opener sequence (×3) but effect is intentional, mimicking ritual beats. Closure image is sharp, uncluttered. Clean grammar, tactile verbs, no scaffold loops.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet limpid: “a sliver of impossible sky” does triple image/symbol/job. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances chalk-map, character, or refraction concept. Metaphors stay inside physics of light; no mixed vehicles. Minor over-adornment in “quiet, explosive knowledge”—two adjectives where one would burst—but it lands in closure beat so the flare feels earned, not purple. Clean grammar, varied paragraph rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean and image-rich; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. Metaphors (“grief like pollen,” “stone throat”) are coherent and sparse. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve by concrete image. A single hairline slip—“internal misery” verges on label-speak—keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long botanical clauses versus staccato “…thread of silver, strand of gold…” fragments. High information density—one sentence often layers plant lore, memory shard, and emotional charge. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“nascent sun,” “pearlescent glow”) feels earned by fairy-tale register. Copy-clean; no typos or pronoun drift. Final line offers cadential snap that recharges mica-window motif.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean and double-duty: “crumpled invitation…softened and wrecked by the anxious twisting of his hands” reveals object state and interior torque in one breath. Figurative layer is restrained; when it appears (“heart a frantic bird”) it coincides with actual stillness, so it reads as character perception rather than ornament. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. A single paraphrase hiccup—“contained and limitless” / “nested paradoxes” within three lines—keeps this just under 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm flexes with breath of scene: long, clause-rich lines for contemplative seeding; staccato exchanges for confrontation; no opener monotony. Figurative density is spare—only “slow green conquest” or “fine grey dust”—each image reappears in closure, earning its place. No synonym loops, no mixed metaphors, no filler filter verbs. The final line’s shift from abstract “fragile peace” to tactile “ordinary dirt under her fingernails” offers concrete cadence payoff, satisfying read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelled by strong verbs (“piercing,” “slotted,” “stabbed”). Information is layered: the slide’s thinness, shimmer, and historical burden arrive in one tactile stroke. Metaphors are sparse, consistent (ice/light/sound), and never mixed. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause advances either apparatus state or emotional pressure. Final line “another piece of their soul was saved” achieves closure-image concision without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative load is controlled—“metallic tang of unspoken agreements” risks abstraction but is anchored to taste. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One mixed moment: “comforting unease” is stated twice; second instance could compress. Otherwise clean propulsion, high density, zero typos.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences perform double duty: sensory data + hypothesis test. No scaffold loops; repetition (“lavender…lavender”) is purposeful closure echo. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles (compass, flock, harbor) stay nautical/orienteering. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“quivering,” “whipped,” “crackled”) propel. One pronoun glide—“their individual storms marking them as vessels”—reads clear via antecedent chain. Final image is clean, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “fine charcoal dust under his fingernails a gritty reminder” does triple duty (sensory, occupation, guilt); no scaffold loops, metaphors coherent (“auroral sorrow”), final line crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense: each sentence layers sensory detail or causal link without scaffold. Metaphors (“sweet poison on the recycled air”) are spare, apt, and internally consistent. Zero loops, no register drift; final paragraph accelerates into a single breath that lands the image cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences perform dual labor: “a low, foundational hum began as the largest lens of ice slowly turned” simultaneously gives sound, motion, scale. No loops, no mixed metaphors; the only scaffolding is the deliberate repetition of “glisten,” which accretes meaning each time.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “Chaos does not erupt; it seeps” performs three jobs—corrects expectation, paints motion, foreshadows containment method. No scaffold; each sentence advances either geothermal mechanics or emotional voltage. Figurative language is sparse, deliberate: “facets sharp enough to cut light” once, then done. Final line—“I take the first step out”—is monosyllabic release after a crescendo of polysyllabic tech diction, earning rhythmic closure without poetic inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, scaffolding-free; sentences often double-duty (e.g., “silver worn smooth by a thumb long since turned to dust” sets object history and Elias’s reverence). No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Minor template echo: three consecutive “[Name] said” attributions mid-page, but not in closure beat. High information density throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high-density lines (“water pressure hummed a constant, low dirge”) do double duty for atmosphere and stakes; figurative control holds even in the peak dice-roll beat, no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence can plant lantern-light, salt geometry, and emotional stakes. No loops or synonym churn; “salt,” “gravity,” and “memory” recur only when they accrue new charge. Metaphors stay physical—galaxy of coffee, marrow-pull—never mixed. One micro-slip: “gleaming silence was shattered by a storm of sensation” borders oxymoron, but the paradox is purposeful, so only a hairline deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with selective sensory detail; no filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay physically coherent (draft as arrival/departure narrative) and avoid purple stretch. One mixed image—“silhouette stitched from twilight”—is borderline but justified by the later reveal that Elias is literally immaterial. Clause variation is excellent; paragraph cut test passes—removing any paragraph would delete either causality or texture. Minor scaffolding: “agreed upon lies” phrase repeats three times; trimming one instance would polish but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense, vivid, clean; sentences multitask (“sun-drenched afternoon shattered by a flash of falling metal and light”). Figurative layer stays coherent—no metaphor collisions. Minor scaffold: “velvet” repeats twice in first two grafs; “resonant” + “resonance” within four lines. These nudge rhythmic monotony but do not obscure causality or dull closure. High-stress beat avoids purple overload. Grammar, tense, pronoun clarity flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops, no scaffold; every sentence advances stakes or image. Metaphors are coherent and non-contradictory: ink as congenital disease, thorn as surgeon’s scalpel. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts land on micro-revelations. Final line “the stalactites within continued their steady, rhythmic dripping, now measuring the beginning of a peace…” resolves cadence and recharges motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm accelerates with each echo return, then lengthens into the final sustained note, matching breath. Metaphors stay within acoustic physics (“starlight pooled like liquid silver” is the only poetic reach, but it serves the mirror of sound/light). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or stakes. One possible trim: “dust and starlight filling her lungs” could lose “and starlight,” but the cadence wants the gulp of air—leave it.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “walls weep history” compresses time and mood. No loops or synonym churn; each snow-globe return adds new informational layer. Figurative language stays coherent—glacier breath, human eclipse—without mixed-metaphor collisions. Final paragraph lands with crisp image-propulsion: “still broken…no longer a prison.”

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences layer sensory, metaphoric, and occupational detail without padding. Figurative language is selective—moon paths, living loom—and paid off at closure; no metaphor churn obscures causality. Occasional lyrical parallelism (“whispering parapet,” “whispering tines”) is pattern-taught early and earns its return. Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; final paragraph propels rather than summarizes.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“two jagged teeth biting the sky”). Information density is high—each sentence advances premise, image, or causality. A single adverb (“unnaturally”) is the only slight slack; otherwise line-level craft is publish-now clean.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: every sentence advances image, stakes, or pressure; no filler. Figurative language is selective, avoids purple haze. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses during lightning duet, then widens for dawn release. One near-loop—“lonely visionary” echo—minor, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level density high: “sealing the moment inside before it could vanish” compresses time, stakes, and method into one clause. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors stay physically faithful—tide foam does sigh, crab legs do tap-dance. Opening and closing lines act as inhalation/exhalation, propelling the reader through dusty gold fingers into salt-stung stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is dense yet transparent: “the tone was fleshly ethereal” fuses body and concept in five words. No loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are internally consistent (glass, sound, light) and tied to POV expertise. Opening and closing lines perform bookend echo—sunset bleeding gold → violet dusk—without feeling contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong rhythm variance: long Latinate clauses for twilight calm, then hammer-beat sentences at switch-click. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“scroll of frozen white,” “spine of black iron”—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold loop: “the wild animal…her ribs” appears twice; acceptable because second use is a payoff, not filler. No line artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and double-tasking: “his boots leaving clean prints in the damp silt” simultaneously grounds setting and character authority. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“fortress around a core of sudden, jarring vulnerability”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances knowledge, pressure, or atmosphere. A single adverb-ial softener (“immediately”) is the only micro-flaw preventing 9.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; strong verbs (“swallowed,” “wrestled,” “pierced”) carry load without modifier clutter. One near-loop: “He felt the old, useless weight… a silent God” restates prior guilt, but the line’s cadence serves as prayer-like incantation, forgiven. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; the final paragraph lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density—one sentence often drafts tool, emotion, and world rule. No loops, no scaffold, no register drift. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “acid sea… monstrous stomach” is the single extended metaphor and it’s anchored in POV fear. Propulsion stays tight to the final bell-laugh.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold or synonym loops; each sentence either advances knowledge or adds sensory charge. Figurative language is sparse, surgical: “tomb-like quiet,” “sharp pinprick of light,” every metaphor is physically coherent and pays off within the archive’s logic. Opening line anchors voice and concept simultaneously: “Corporate Memory Keeper, a euphemism for janitor of a dead social network” — dense, ironic, propulsive. Only micro-flaw: “stellar-wind recordings” risks faint NASA-brochure diction, but it is one phrase in a field of otherwise idiosyncratic noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose shows rhythmic control: “sharp edges and bitter weight” (opening) echoes in “sharp… weight” of truth at end. Metaphors are spare, consistent (ice, glass, breath); no mixed vehicles. Few adverbs, strong verbs (“drift,” “shriek,” “plumed”). No scaffold/loop; paragraphs advance situation or emotion. One clause—“a thing of sharp edges and bitter weight”—verges on abstraction but is earned by immediate sensory follow-through, forgiven at closure distance.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences do triple duty—e.g.,“bright orange vest, a euthanasia tourist masquerading as a saint” seeds color, moral deceit, and stakes. Metaphors are precise and non-contradictory: masts “like praying hands” mirrors ice calving as secular amen. No paraphrase loops; each debris item advances her syllabus. Rhythm breathes with scene tide, accelerating during ice crackle without cluttering the auditory climax.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet imagistic; sentences carry dual duty—grounding sensory world and advancing metaphor. Figurative language is disciplined, patterned, and paid off (scorched edge → lace). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Opening line anchors tone and stakes; final line offers resonant re-cadence. Minor over-investment in vineyard metaphors slightly dilutes immediacy, but clarity remains intact through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and taught: “loom of sound” opens, paid off by the sealed vacuum. Information density high—“kinetic parapet beneath the dunes” delivers world, stakes, and mystery in six words. Register never drifts above Kael’s contemplative lexicon. Final line cadence mirrors opening, creating closure via echo rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet uncluttered: single sentences double as scenic action and metaphoric mapping—“the geography of a community’s heart.” No paraphrase loops; each photograph shard adds a new sensory angle. Metaphors stay coherent (spiral of life, arc of tear to smile) and do not invade high-pressure beats. Minor qualifier clusters (“against all odds”) keep it from 8.5+ but do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long sentences for suspended hush, staccato fragments for sonic shards. Metaphors precise—“folded into a question mark,” “fat teardrop of Bohemian glass”—no mixed vehicles. Information-dense: one sentence often layers glass physics, emotional tenor, and thematic hint. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances texture or knowledge. Final line lands clean, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The fog swirled, momentarily thinning to reveal the stone” advances motion while re-grounding space. No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (fog as artist, tape-hush as sound). Peak beat avoids purple overload—“he was the sound” is single stark declaration. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and echo each other through the circle image.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “bruised clouds,” “diamond-dust stars” compress atmosphere without purple drift. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances choice or image. Strong verbs—“slotted,” “fractured,” “snapped”—propel the climax. One mixed metaphor (“sea of bruised clouds”) barely grazes clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold loops; each sentence either advances causal chain or delivers sensory detail that feeds the next move. Metaphors are controlled—two extended images (velvet void, sugar dissolution) spaced widely enough to avoid clutter. High information density: “rune for inversion...no longer meant upside-down but inside-out” simultaneously world-builds, foreshadows method, and escalates stakes. No mixed registers or artifact cadences; final paragraph lands with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information-dense without clutter; single sentences fuse action, sensory detail, and metaphor (“flimsy as a cobweb in morning mist”). Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay horticultural/medical. No paraphrase loops, but two near-adjectives (“impossibly small tooth, glowing with a faint pearlescent light”) could compress. All scaffolding removed; read-aloud rhythm modulates from languid nostalgia to decisive star-draft. Closure line (“infinitely larger”) lands clean—simple, unadorned, letting prior lyricism echo.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is almost loop-free; only tiny scaffold is “quiet, determined goal.” Metaphors are coherent—glass as cataract, grotto as embrace—and payoff at closure. High density: “saltwater and grit” does two jobs (texture + stakes). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the polishing strokes. No mixed vehicles or register drift. Final line offers charged image, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: short “drip, drip, drip” against luxuriant moss descriptors. Sentence starts diversify; no template cadence. Metaphors are disciplined (river delta / microprocessor) and internally consistent. One paraphrase loop: “soft weight in the air thick with… damp earth” could compress, but it does not touch the closure beat. High information density: one sentence often does scent + emotional tilt + setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract under final pressure. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors; “choir of what-ifs” stays singular and coherent. One paraphrase loop: “swirling hush” appears twice but is purposeful motif reinforcement, not artifact. Opening and final lines anchor voice and re-charge motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Figurative language is dense—moon “luminous coin,” vine “conduit,” hush “pregnant”—yet pattern is taught early and paid off in final quiet, so no overwrite penalty. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Information density is high: one sentence often layers sight, mythic time, and tactile motion. Closure sentence (“path was illuminated”) is crisp and propulsive. Minor cliché hush/ breath but not clustered; clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or action. Figurative layer is spare—only “glowing capillaries” and “cold ozone”—never overwriting the tactile sequence. Opening line anchors voice and world-scale stakes; final line crystallizes the cyclical cost. Read-aloud rhythm breathes: long clauses for starlight pour, staccato coda for ignition. No scaffolding, no register drift; technical terms (flash paper, permafrost) appear once and earn their place.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density: “lattice of spun silver and quartz” does world, object, and beauty in six words. No filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is spare; when it appears (“celestial clock hand”) it physically obtains—sunbeam across marble. Closure beat “ghost of candlelight” is crystalline, uncluttered, letting the reconfiguration shine.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and varied; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse, specific, and coherent—"shard of glass in the psychic current" conveys exact intensity without mixed metaphors. Information density is high: each sentence advances image, stakes, or process. One paraphrase loop ("shingled hush" echoed twice in close proximity) is the only micro-flaw, not touching closure; otherwise line-level control is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Sentences carry double duty: “the rain came down in sheets, drumming...” sets sound, pace, and metaphor in one sweep. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—stillness as ocean, memory as shard—without mixed metaphors. High density: one sentence can anchor body, tool, and emotional state. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; clause length mirrors kettle crescendo. Closure line “newly scarred block of wood” is crisp, propulsive, artifact-free. Hairline only: “rust-hued peace” edges purple, but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Varied sentence rhythm, strong verbs (“scuffing,” “blossomed”) keep momentum. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensorium or causal step. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“ghost of a ghost” sets tone without overwriting. Minor scaffold: “She looked up” is a neutral stage direction that could be cut for immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but breathable; figurative language is selective, no sentence-long metaphor piles. Variation in sentence length propels the ritual beat. No synonym loops; “hush,” “silence,” “quiet” carry distinct acoustic shades. Grammar clean; opening and closing lines serve as frame and echo. One paraphrase risk—“the silence… became the tomb” shortly followed by “tomb” again—minor, does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero scaffold, high density: single sentences perform triple duty—e.g., “Slowly, a small, heavily corroded lockbox broke the water’s surface, shedding mud and dark water like a surfacing leviathan” (setting, object embodiment, metaphor). No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new mechanical or sensory info. Opening line anchors tone and stakes; final line resolves via image that recharges sundial paradox. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between long, breath-held clauses and staccato prepositional fragments, supporting the coaxing tempo. Figurative language is restrained to one metaphor per high-pressure beat, each grounded in maritime physics (“hardened fist of hemp”). No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Information density is high: a single sentence often layers sensory detail, tool function, and conceptual import. Final line resolves by image, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold. Sentence variety propels: temporal participle opener alternates with noun-phrase crescendo. Figurative logic intact—“ghost of warmth” literalizes later when dye retains body heat. High density: one sentence can scent, color, and foreshadow (“fallen pear leaves plastered to moss” = map adhesion). Final line cadence mirrors loom shuttle stop, earning rhythmic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal data. Metaphors are precise: “robes… frayed to a bedraggled grey” marries color to social decay. No filter-verb stacks; action verbs drive lines. Opening and closing sentences act as brackets—rust/echoes vs. quaking hands stilled—creating circular muscle. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long mournful clauses to staccato chip-chip-chip of emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences perform place-setting, character backstory, and stake (“daughter of an arsonist, and this place was her only church”). Figurative language is selective—black sand as “tactile prayer,” bark as “impossible hope”—and never clusters during peak graft beat. No scaffold or synonym loops; “black” recurs only with new conceptual weight. Opening and closing lines echo sand/black but reweight meaning, showing purposeful repetition rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “sidereal patience,” “defiant hush,” and “cosmetics of fractured color” compress concept and atmosphere in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stance or image. Metaphors stay coherent—spiral of water, spiral of light, spiral of migrating geese—creating pattern without repetition. Final clause “answered by the city's liberated soul” risks abstraction, but the prior whisper of water has already embodied the answer, so the line lands as resonance, not tell.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often handles atmosphere, backstory, and causal nudge (“For eons… brilliant, hungry consumption”). Metaphors stay internally consistent—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “the garden’s” phrases could trim, but artifacts never touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm swells naturally toward the final broadcast clause.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Compression avoids loops; every sentence adds chisel-sound, texture, or pattern. Mixed metaphors (“orange wings like ember… skeletal fingers”) stay internally coherent. No filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph lands with crystalline sparseness after lush storm passage—cadence shift supports closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is textured yet economical: “cobalt silo under the first stars” fuses colour, architecture, and celestial cue in five words. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and coherent. Opening line anchors tone and stakes; final line resolves by image (“the cobalt dome…held the stars…with tenderness”) that recharges prior motifs. One tiny register lift—“conceptual repricing” is evaluator language, not Elias’s—stops the piece at 8.8 rather than 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, propulsive; sentences carry dual payloads (e.g., “a vast, unwritten page of white” equates lake + vellum). Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay within ice/writing lexicon. No loops, scaffolds, or filter-verb stacks in peak beat. Minor cadence echo (“the… the…”) is thematic, taught, and deliberate.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “He dipped his pen… leaving no visible trace” simultaneously advances action, reveals tool contraband, and foreshadows closure. Metaphors are spare and consistent (ivy, trellis, ember, thistle), avoiding mixed-vehicle clutter. No paraphrase loops; each repetition (e.g., “dial’s glow”) accrues new semantic charge. One microscopic scaffold—“a silence born from the great story famine”—is justified as world-building compression, not padding.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Figurative language is sparse and patterned—only two metaphors (“second skin,” “heavy, knowing stone”)—both pay off thematically and never clutter the high-pressure final beat. Information density is high: one sentence slips us from “brazier” to “fine, dark powder” without scaffolding. No synonym churn or template cadence; each sentence opens with varied syntax. The final line’s “vanishing point of the gallery” reuses the title phrase as a deliberate repricing, not a loop.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances either sediment or philosophy. Figurative control is surgical: “cold ache in his bones feel like a worthy sacrifice” marries sensation to abstract cost without mixed metaphor. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Micro-rhythm accelerates during cleaning (“his movements precise, almost reverent”) then reverts to stoic cadence for the boxed ending. Opening and closing lines are anchor-and-resonance pair: gallery→memory, echoing without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean and image-rich; no loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is restrained—“frayed rope,” “ghosts of old arguments”—and stays coherent. Sentence rhythm modulates between long reflective units and short imperative ones during the breathing exercise. Opening and final lines are anchored and resonant. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences pull double duty: “the last rays of sun bleed across the sky, a syrupy, nectar dusk” layers visual, taste, and metaphor in one breath. No filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent—storm-drinking, sun-spun glass—within bio-mechanical logic. Opening and closing lines are symmetrical without feeling engineered. Proofing clean; pronoun and prop state stable.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence opens, grounds, and stakes. Figurative language is selective—daydreaming streetlights, bruised lavender—and stays coherent under pressure. No paraphrase loops, synonym churn, mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates for the deposit beat, then exhales into twilight retreat. Final line cadence mirrors first, recharging “hushed blaze” without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Figurative language is selective—“voice of sculpted stone”—and paid off in closure. High density achieved with stacked nominalizations that still read as Mara’s educated lexicon. Final line cadence mirrors opening “secret settled” with “vine pulsed,” giving circular ear-test satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero scaffolding or synonym loops; each sentence advances premise, texture, or pressure. Figurative language sparse and precise—“monument to perpetual motion,” “amber of regret”—never clogs climax. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory data, emotional state, and world rule. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“cradled,” “scratched,” “yielded”) dominate. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via image that re-cues “canvas” motif. Copy-clean, tense stable, pronouns unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often paints, signals time, and mirrors emotional state. No template cadence; sentence openings vary. Metaphors stay coherent—moon as apologizing, city as forgetting breath—without mixed vehicles. Final paragraph accelerates via paratactic “Some… others…” to echo scattered lights. One near-loop “silent, hopeful broadcast” is acceptably tautological for voice; no scaffold obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative load is moderate and purposeful—“web of deadly potential” is exact. Information density high: one sentence often sets scene, mood, and stakes. Minor scaffold: “the sound returned first—a gentle hiss that grew...” restates the obvious beat, but it lands outside the closure third, so 9+ remains open.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors tide exhale; paragraph cuts are surgical. No scaffold loops; each sentence either advances machine-assembly or bodily change. Figurative density is high but patterned—metals, breath, bones—tied to the final violet void. One overwrought phrase: “bones of a forgotten leviathan” slightly strains coherence, preventing 9.0. Otherwise, information density is excellent; technical diction (“escapements,” “tolerance”) is accurate and POV-plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences layer sensory data, metaphor, and causal cue. Figurative language is patterned early (ghost-sugar, silken scrape) and paid off, avoiding purple overload. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor advances new information. Rhythm breathes with action—long sentence for slide descent, staccato for mirror shatter—without template cadence. Minor register flicker at “annihilating focus as a camera’s lens” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, sound, or causality. Metaphor density is high but patterned—music-sea equations taught early and sustained—so no overwriting penalty. Rhythm mirrors content: swell-build-release cadence in paragraph shapes. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “song” motif. Concrete nouns and strong verbs prevail—“churning turquoise,” “silvered wood”—with modifiers used sparingly for sonic specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. High information density: a single line can layer light, maternal absence, and civic isolation. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“sun that bleached the sky to a pale, hazy shimmer” compresses climate and psychology. Zero scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphor; final crack line is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: single sentences deliver dual duties (ivy both décor and metaphor). No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles (hollow story, rotten roots) cohere. Strong verbs, minimal modifiers. No filter-verb stacks in high-stress beats. Clean mechanics; pronouns unambiguous, tense stable. Only minor register elevation (“gilded cage”) that fits Thorne’s academic lens.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks, concrete nouns (“brass body,” “viscous ink”) and strong verbs (“unstrapped,” “scrabbled”) throughout. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“skeletal hand reaching from a watery grave”—and avoids purple density. Opening line anchors voice and stakes immediately; final line (“quiet, unshakeable purpose”) resolves by image, not abstraction. Minor risk: “phantom limb of a distant storm” is the only mixed metaphor, but it is brief and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose rhythm mirrors the blackout’s hush: varied sentence lengths, no template cadence, no scaffold. Every line telescopes—salt-sealed drawer shriek carries sound, tactility, and metaphoric guilt in eight words. Figurative language is spare and precise: “ghost of an impression” is exact, not decorative. Zero loops, zero filter-verb stacks; information density peaks in the stamp-match beat without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence detected. High density: single sentences fuse motion, memory, metaphor (“folded his grief into a thousand origami cranes”). Occasional poetic uplift (“powdered starlight”) is earned by voice register, not purple. One near-loop: “each upward step a plunge deeper” echoes earlier ascent/descent—functional recurrence, not artifact. Closure image pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and physics-anchored—missile as perturbation—avoiding purple drift. One mixed metaphor: “festering heart” clashes with prior sterile imagery, a micro-slip that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances drone move, sensory filter, or schematic reveal. Metaphors—“captured star,” “font of pure meaning”—are spare, appear only at pivot beats, and payoff literally. Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line resolves via image. No register drift, no simultaneity errors, no redundant phrasing. Read-aloud rhythm mirrors drone ascent then held breath at iris opening.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: each sentence advances grief, world, or tactic—“trafficker in forbidden bloodlines” does triple duty. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are clean—“sound like sandpaper on bone”—and internally consistent. Only micro-slip: “world bleeding from blue to bruised purple” skirts purple prose, but the image is brief and sets tone without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: opening lyrical, mid-scene short clauses during key-turn, final sentence lengthens into elegiac cadence. No filter-verb stacks; “Elias knelt and pointed” keeps verb strong. One possible loop—“wind snatch / wind sigh” in adjacent paragraphs—but divergence is thematic (passive vs active), not synonym churn. Information density high: one sentence often does three jobs (anchor, sensory, motive).

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors tidal drag and release; clauses lengthen toward horizon, then cut short on gravel thud. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—sea & sky & navigation metaphors sustain coherence; no mixed vehicles. Information dual-load frequent: “soft thud on the gravel a sound of finality” advances action + stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds salt, guilt, or spatial data.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops; sentences multi-task (“the tunnel opened into a cavern of impossible scale” advances spatial knowledge and emotional hit). Figurative language is sparse, never overwrought; “desert of ash” is earned by prior despair. Copy-clean; pronoun tracking perfect even in letter-within-story.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with ritual pace—sentence length swells and contracts to mirror inhalation of scent. Information density high: each grind of pestle doubles as prayer and world-rule reminder. No loops or scaffold; the single “then” is justified. Metaphors are coherent within scent/avian/moon lexicon; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-charge the motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (anchor, metaphor, emotional charge). Figurative language is selective; no mixed-metaphor muddle. Rhythm breathes with beats—short sentence at cloak-drop gives release. Occasional “choking beauty”-style tag repetition is purposeful, not scaffold, and pays off in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean yet tactile: “needle thin as a whisper,” “thread of spun starlight.” No synonym loops, no filter-verb stacks. Mixed-metaphor risk in “lead weight” vs. “airy vessel” is justified by the literal weight–lightness physics. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one stroke; final line resolves by image (swirling aperture) that recharges every silver knot before it. Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: obsidian grains “born of ancient fire” does triple world-building work. No synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent (spiral = map, fireflies = tiny lanterns). One mixed metaphor—“hiss of waves…louder than a scream”—is earned by emotional crest. Final line is crisp, propulsive, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. High density: “coded angles of the painted roman numerals” fuses world-rule, tool, and action. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“island of soft, pearlescent light”—never clutters the high-pressure beat. Final line lands with rhythmic snap and no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lines are dense but breathe—variation in sentence length, no template cadence. Metaphors are internally coherent (storm/vigil/darkroom) and paid off. No loops or synonym churn; “acid of his memories” is the only slightly stock phrase but is earned. High information-to-word ratio without purple drag. Clean grammar and pronoun tracking.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often layers light, metal, angle, and philosophy without crowding. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; only micro-flaw is “dignified chaos” appearing twice in close proximity. Read-aloud rhythm is controlled, paragraph cuts tight; final line releases tension with quiet chime. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Varied sentence rhythm mirrors emotional cadence; no template runs. Figurative language is spare and precise—“sliver of bone,” “cathedral of decay”—and disappears under pressure, keeping the final beat clear. Information density is high: one sentence often does two jobs (“She set down a heavy canvas bag. ‘More foundlings,’ she announced”). Zero loops or synonym churn; no scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is near-loop-free; only tiny echo (“each note a drop…each staccato note”) is forgivable because the repetition is thematic. Metaphors stay coherent within film/music registers; no mixed vehicles. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts are purposeful. The single line where “blade” substitutes for resolve is the closest to register drift, but the metaphor is prepared and paid off. High information density—every clause either advances the portal build or textures the arbor.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “thick with the scent of pollen and approaching rain” does triple sensory duty. Metaphors stay coherent (river drawn to womb, moonlight as cradle) and physically legible. One paraphrase loop (“seed…seed…seed” in final paragraph) but momentum unbroken. No scaffolding, no mixed-register drift. Final line earns its uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“cerulean regret,” “ink in water”) and never clogs the beat. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentences vary in length and opening. One mixed-metaphor risk—“tides of remembrance … a drowning force … gentle swell”—reads intentional and is resolved within the paragraph. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and purposeful: “humidity was a physical weight,” “frantic energy fossilized on a plastic canvas.” Figurative language is consistent and clarifying, not muddled. Minor redundancy in “messy, loud, and emotional” / “messy, heartbreaking, and beautiful,” but not looped. Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates appropriately. No scaffold, no purple prose—every line advances character, theme, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“a maw of blackened brick,” “frost... a language of crystalline geometry”). Figurative language is coherent—fire as “ghost-heat,” ledger as “smuggler’s” artifact—and avoids purple excess.

    Prose exhibits high information density: “potential is a current, and it can be diverted” compresses theme, motive, and world logic in one line. Figurative language is pattern-taught (water displacement, music/chord metaphors) and payoff-earned at closure. No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythms vary purposefully—staccato during crisis, flowing at epiphany. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in “intangibly tangible echo,” but clarity never suffers, and the final paragraph’s propulsion toward “trajectory” is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “stone on stone that vibrated through the floor” conveys sound, texture, and consequence in one phrase. Minimal scaffolding; every sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (“golden filigree,” “font of pure meaning”) and tied to the story’s logic. One slight redundancy: “perpetually surprised” appears twice, but second use deepens meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“sieved hush,” “bleeding” colors) and culminates coherently. Minor overwriting in “acidic burn of his tempered regret” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters just enough—two complex ideas in one sentence—to prevent 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “mist tasted of salt and old stone” merges taste/touch/texture while anchoring mood. Syntax varies naturally; paragraph lengths mirror pacing (short during exchange, longer for reflection). No loops or scaffold—every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor deduction: “furrowed hush” borders on mixed metaphor but pays off tonally in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or conflict. Figurative language (“stars had become a cartography of his failure”) is coherent and pattern-taught, not overwritten. Minor scaffold in “merrily melancholic joke for an audience of one” slightly abstracts, but momentum remains. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and the final line (“finally taking the first step back toward himself”) resolves with resonant specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “scraped his mind clean” conveys procedure and emotion in five words. Figurative language is purposeful, not decorative—e.g., “planting a forest in a desert of ash” crystallizes his task. Minor scaffold in “weeks of searching yielded a pattern…” could be tighter, but no loops or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s rhythm swells then stills, mirroring his emotional shift—exemplary line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically (short staccato beats amid lyrical flows), and every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent—scales “drink moonlight,” scent weaves “like a tangible ghost”—without muddle. One minor slip: “paradoxically steady” borders on label-speak, though immediately grounded by kneeling on moss. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s “eternal, steady glow” echoes opening’s “steady” movement, closing the cadence cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“choking beauty,” “star-dusted clouds”) but avoids overwriting—figurative language appears in key beats without muddle. Sentence openings vary (“The air...”, “Elara...”, “From a worn...”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One minor redundancy: “fractured heart” slightly paraphrases the saucer’s crack, but it’s brief and doesn’t dull closure. Final line (“steady, hopeful outline”) resonates without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is vivid and efficient, with high information density (“needle thin as a whisper,” “thread of spun starlight”). Minor overwriting in “ghosts of a dozen forgotten starships” slightly dilutes opening impact, but no loops or scaffold. Figurative language coheres (weight/lightness motif), and closure beat avoids artifacts. Sentence rhythm breathes with Elara’s emotional cadence, though one or two modifiers edge toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “glassy obsidian grains born of ancient fire” conveys geology, texture, history). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching the narrative pulse. One minor flaw: “whispering hush” borders on oxymoronic cliché, slightly dulling the otherwise precise sensory lexicon. No loops, scaffolding, or register drift; closure image (“new, steady heartbeat”) lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density—e.g., “phosphorescent algae, pulsed with a gentle life of their own” conveys setting, mood, and world logic in one phrase. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths shift with pacing. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (fort as island, revolution as spark network). One minor artifact: “winking hush” slightly strains as a compound modifier, but doesn’t obscure clarity. Final line’s “silent promise kept” resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “frictionless wall of water erasing the bluff” conveys scale and physics in 7 words. Figurative language is coherent (aurora as “river,” star dust as “thimbleful of night”) and never muddled in peak beats. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Below…”, “Above…”, “He moved…”). Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “chaotic grace of the cosmos”—elevated but justifiable for Kael’s worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “a sea of clouds churned, silently blasted by flashes” merges visual and kinetic. Figurative language is pattern-taught (storm = psyche, observatory = skull) and coheres. Minor flaw: “furiously tranquil” risks label-speak but is immediately embodied in trembling hands and statue-calm. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence shift (storm recedes, light glimmers) earns its quiet lift.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences multitask (e.g., “His left arm... caught the morning light” establishes character, setting, and motif). Figurative language is restrained and coherent—light “constellations,” shadow as “accusatory finger”—never muddling causality. Paragraph cuts align with tactical shifts (circling → drawing rapier → final thrust). Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “whirlwind of dignified chaos,” but no loops, scaffolds, or register drift impair clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “slough away like dry skin” merges metaphor and sensation efficiently. Sentences vary rhythmically—long descriptive strands yield to short declarations (“There is shelter here”). One minor flaw: “luminous fracture” slightly overreaches as abstract descriptor amid otherwise concrete imagery. No loops or scaffolding; every line advances character, setting, or stakes. Final paragraph’s cadence (“sorting books”) closes with earned simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “each note a drop of silvered sorrow” establishes tone economically; “rectangle of pure, silent-film white burned into existence” crystallizes climax without overwriting. Figurative language is coherent (music as blade, film as map) and peaks without muddle. Minor deduction for slight density in opening paragraph (“tidal arbor above the clouds, a platform of woven lightwood…”)—two appositives slightly stall momentum—but recovers instantly. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “sky-plume blossoms frothed in a riot of impossible blues” does setting, tone, and character work. Figurative language is coherent (river/mountain, net/starlight, laughter/conch form a unified creation motif). Minor deduction: slight overwriting in “luminous doubt, her constant companion” edges toward label-speak, but it’s redeemed by later embodiment. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors rainfall—building to “pour”—with zero scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose achieves high information density—e.g., “tides of remembrance were high today” merges metaphor with physical setting. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“The air…”, “Kenji stood…”, “He snipped…”). Minor overwriting in “ethereal light began to pulse” slightly dilutes closure beat, but figurative coherence holds (blue glow ↔ cerulean regret). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with emotional cadence; no scaffold or template cadence.
