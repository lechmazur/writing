  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "She retraced…" / "Retracing her path…" / "She had retraced…"; "steadily adaptive" appears twice; "drifting resonance" recurs as thematic marker without accruing new pressure. Stock metaphors ("blanket of stars," "balm after the chaos," "inner light") dull specificity. Repeated sentence stems ("She held…," "She realized…," "She decided…," "She stood…") create drumbeat monotony. The final third stacks these patterns without propulsion, triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally. Several lines restate content without added pressure, e.g., "The frost formed intricate designs, like maps or codes" followed immediately by comparison to her glass art.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose carries vivid images ("scarlet for fear, azure for sorrow, emerald for hope") and maintains clarity, but suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple sentences begin with "She [verb]" across the middle third ("She pressed," "She adjusted," "She moved," "She repeated"), flattening rhythm. Phrases like "to rectify the emptiness" and "to purify it into something harmonious" recur without added pressure, and "unshaken marvels" appears six times, often as mere label. These artifacts accumulate to −0.6 in this category and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, but several patterns recur: "His [noun] [verb]" stems appear frequently, and abstract constructions ("the chased stillness he had yearned for," "a summons," "whispered of the sea") stack without concrete anchoring. The phrase "chased stillness" appears three times, functioning as a motif but edging into loop territory. Figurative language ("water pressing in like a thick, dark quilt") is vivid but dense, appearing in most beats without pattern-teaching. The final paragraph summary ("used the broken to make whole, the impossible to make possible") tells rather than trusts the image, reducing closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence openings vary, and paragraph structure supports scene shifts. However, paraphrase loops accumulate: "These runs depended on anonymous donations, mysterious parcels" adjacent to "No one knew who left these gifts; the anonymity was a shield." Template cadence runs appear: "She was gently persistent… Her motivation was clear… She gathered… She rang… She felt… She raised… She rang." Stock metaphors—"tapestry of trust," "beacon," "echo of a future"—cluster in the final third without fresh specificity. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but scaffold sentences like "The community leaned in, young and old, their breaths held in shared resolve" narrate rather than dramatize.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "unused love" and "stored away" recycle across adjacent sentences, and "spiritually curious" appears three times without functional variation. Template cadence dominates—runs of "She + verb" and "The + noun + verb" span the middle third without rhythmic shift. Stock metaphors ("pilgrim of sparks," "foggy lucidity," "invisible architecture") pile without concrete grounding. The final paragraph summarizes outcomes in five consecutive declarations, each restating completion. These artifacts flatten momentum and dull the closure image, triggering cumulative deductions in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "fading photographs... their images slowly bleeding into obscurity" is restated as "Each lost detail felt like a piece of her own memory dissolving." Template cadence runs appear ("She had designed... she hoped... she found"). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle ("prison of shadows," "tide," "tapestry"). The bridge disintegration beat stacks filter verbs and passive constructions ("was not destruction but transformation, guided by..."). Figurative density at closure ("motes of light," "tide," "tapestry," "infinite loom") muddles rather than clarifies. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering elevated penalty and global 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "Her motivation was clear: to plant resilience" / "Elara's motivation had been simple: to plant resilience" (−0.4). Template cadence dominates the final third: "She walked away… She had impeded… Each seed carried… Elara watched… The arrow's mystery…" (−0.6). Stock metaphors cluster: "ghosts," "testament to hope," "living tapestry," "monument to cleverness." Filter-verb stacks flatten immediacy: "she felt the chains loosen," "seemed to cheer." Cumulative artifact debt reaches the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 threshold and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "collecting absences" is restated six times across the text with near-identical phrasing; "trust breaking" recurs as a label without variation in image. Template cadence dominates the middle section—"She [verb], [noun] [verb]" (e.g., "She waded… She reached… She began… She remembered… She calibrated")—across seven consecutive paragraphs without taught pattern or payoff. Stock metaphors ("memories clung like salt," "cracked bell," "ice cracking") and elevated abstractions ("visceral sensation," "potentials for healing") clash with the POV's designer expertise and the setting's specificity. The final two paragraphs deliver summary exposition rather than propulsive image. Apply paraphrase-loop and template-cadence penalties totaling −1.0; artifacting in closure beats adds −0.7.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose carries multiple paraphrase loops: "illuminated moment" echoes across five separate uses; "quietly savvy" and "luminous disbelief" each appear twice in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence appears in the second paragraph ("She had learned to reinterpret... seeing not just decoration but intention") and recurs in para four ("She had to reinterpret... seeing not a blockade, but a narrow service corridor"). Figurative density is high throughout—"coiled in the air like smoke," "alive with secrets," "threshold"—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff. The final third remains crowded with metaphor during action beats, lowering clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence weaken momentum: "thawing heart of the landscape outside mirrored a thaw within her, a slow unfreezing of emotions" restates the same idea across clauses. Runs of "She [verb]" stems in the final third (She shaped, She held, She knew, She felt, She packed, She stepped) create drumbeat rhythm. Stock metaphors ("pearl," "molten," "sanctuary") appear without fresh angle. Figurative density in non-peak beats (dramatic narration passages) reads as overwriting without pattern payoff. Apply −1.0 for loops and template cadence; −0.3 for stock metaphor strings. Total artifacts ≥−1.3, which disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "his motivation was clear" → "he must prove"; "his phobias...screamed" → "each panicked breath to sharpen his focus." Template cadence runs in the final third ("He did not conquer his fears; he invited them along"). Stock metaphors ("tomb of knowledge," "anchored himself in the storm") dull specificity. The closure beat is touched by scaffold ("forever changed, his certainty no longer trembling but unshakable"), triggering the artifact escalation (−1.7 baseline, disallow 9+ globally). Rhythm is sluggish; information density is low.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high; grammar and punctuation are clean. Information density is adequate, though several lines paraphrase without advancing pressure: "Its optical sensors scanned... noting the way" restates observation; "The procedure... was meant to wipe its memory, but instead, it had left J-7 with overlapping recollections" summarizes backstory already implied. Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "it had learned / it intended / it understood" stems (−0.4). No loops touch the closure beat, capping the deduction. Figurative language is sparse and coherent (tapestry of moments, thread connecting selves), avoiding overwriting. Propulsion is steady but not urgent; several beats could be condensed without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.8)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs flatten momentum. Paragraphs 10–12 recycle "after words became unnecessary" and "ambiguously clear" without adding pressure. Stock phrases abound: "spirits lifting as if a burden had vanished," "newfound understanding," "language of mutual respect." The investigation's key discovery ("she pieced together that the doodles pointed to secret rendezvous") is told in summary rather than shown through image. Sentence stems repeat ("The…," "She…," "They…") across beats without rhythmic variation. Information density is low; many lines restate the transparency-thaws-mistrust thesis without advancing situation or complicating emotion. Closure beats lean on abstract metaphor rather than concrete final action.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "Her collection of cracked marbles," "each crack," "each polish" recur without advancing meaning. Stock metaphors ("maze seemed to breathe," "light filled cracks") and abstraction ("arbitrary fortune," "unmeasurable reality") replace concrete action. Register drifts into essay-like summation ("This was an era after luck had become measurable"). Figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching, and the closure beat is buried under restatement. Multiple artifacts touch the ending, triggering cumulative penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are generally clear and varied, with purposeful rhythm modulation ("the hush of beating wings at rest" recurs effectively). However, minor scaffold appears: "Tonight, however, his mind was fixed on a personal crusade" front-loads exposition, and "a man whose kindness was as reliable as the systems he maintained" summarizes rather than shows. The opening and closing contain mild paraphrase loops ("icy warmth"/"mechanically warm" used multiple times without tightening). Information density is adequate but some lines do double duty without advancing pressure. No major artifacts, but the prose does not achieve the compression or propulsion of high-band work.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is largely clean. Several lines loop or paraphrase without added pressure: "She needed to disrupt the ghost's eternal waiting" is immediately followed by similar concepts in adjacent beats. Template cadence appears in the middle section ("She focused... She felt... She hummed... She realized") stacking similar stems. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the transformation ("had unraveled," "felt less haunted," "carrying the ghost's silent legacy"), which dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate the middle and closing third: "she realized…," "she saw…," "she felt…," "she decided…," "she took…," "she found…," "she smudged…" structure adjacent sentences without syntactic variation. Conceptual redundancy appears across paragraphs: the truth about the Bloom is restated in lines 9, 15, 22, 33, 37. Figurative language ("swaying certainties," "auroral sorrow," "weight of a swallowed truth") recurs without evolving meaning or dramatized pressure, reading as motif checklist rather than earned accumulation. Stock metaphor strings ("blurred lines," "smudged lens," "occupying margins") cluster without concrete anchoring. Baseline −0.8 for loops and template cadence; escalate to −1.2 because artifacts touch the closure beat ("she realized," "she felt," "she had found").

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful sensory detail and good rhythm modulation. However, multiple passages exhibit paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy: "swallowed truth" appears three times with near-identical framing; "weight" recurs eight times in similar constructions; "ghost shift" explanation is stated twice in adjacent paragraphs ("never been a supernatural phenomenon" / "auditory imprint of collective trauma"). Template cadence appears in the middle section: "He was...He pressed...He pulled...He knew." Filter-verb stack ("felt a strange reverence") in a reflective beat reduces immediacy. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack, preventing entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "witness change without judgment" / "witnessing change without judgment" / "to witness change without judgment"; "regenerative silence" appears five times in identical phrasing; "grips reality loosely" / "gripping reality loosely" / "to grip reality loosely." Template cadence runs ("The keeper [verb]…") appear across multiple beats. Figurative language is dense without pattern-teaching ("river of its own," "symphony of quiet endings," "beautiful, endless fall"). Applying artifact penalties: paraphrase loops (−0.6), template cadence (−0.5), register drift into philosophical abstraction (−0.4), total deduction ≈−1.5, and artifacts touch the final third, capping all categories at 8.8 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.0)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "beneath the hush of dreaming roots" appears six times without functional variation; "softly adaptive" recurs as a label without action. Sentence stems repeat mechanically ("Elara's [noun], [verb]"; "She [verb], [gerund]"). Stock phrasing clusters in peak beats: "sense of lifelong wonder bloomed," "cautious exuberance," "ordinary magic" function as unearned abstractions. Information density is low; many lines restate the premise without advancing knowledge, choice, or image. Clarity is not harmed, but momentum drags under synonym churn and boilerplate connectors.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from template-cadence runs and paraphrase loops that dull momentum. Repeated sentence stems across multiple lines—"He began to probe," "He read," "He probed deeper," "He learned," "He understood," "He sat"—create a drumbeat rhythm (−0.5). Synonym churn appears in adjacent sentences: "displaced axis" / "axis shift" / "axis displacement" / "axis, once displaced" recur without added nuance (−0.3). Stock phrasing—"pages brittle as autumn leaves," "flickering in the void," "bronze quiet"—replaces concrete, character-specific detail. The final-third repetition of "bronze quiet" and thematic scaffolding ("he had mended the rift") disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy paraphrase loops across adjacent lines: "transpose...into a new key" appears five times, "directing the flow" three times, "after last orders" five times, "orchestrate/orchestrated" four times, creating template cadence without taught pattern or payoff. The final third is dominated by synonym churn ("enigma," "cryptic," "mysterious") and summary scaffolding ("Over nights...they worked," "With this, they transposed"). Filter-verb stacks ("watch," "see," "feel") dull immediacy in peak beats. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the artifact penalty pack: −1.7 baseline, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "decorated with silence" appears three times, "unraveled stillness" four times, "muffled clarity" twice, often restating the same atmospheric effect without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs in the ritual sequence ("He decorated… He must plumb… He dipped… He needed…") flatten rhythm. Mixed metaphor: stillness "unraveled" and later "rewoven" clashes with "threads of calm pulling apart"—织 logic breaks. Stock metaphor "a stain of pure concept" abstracts rather than grounds. Apply −1.2 in Q7 for loops and cadence debt; the final paragraph's clarity is intact, so avoid escalation beyond that range.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.7)
    Sentence openings repeat patterns: "She [verb]" appears in nine consecutive beats mid-story, creating template cadence (−0.5). Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "The unheard symphonies filled the spire" / "she had conducted the symphony of her life" restates without advancing pressure (−0.3). Stock metaphors ("beautiful, invisible storm," "tapestry of sound") and elevated diction ("allegro," "adagio," "crescendo") are stacked without POV-specific justification (−0.4). Information density is low; many lines repeat the mapping conceit without new detail. The closure beat suffers from synonym churn and abstract summary, triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.3)
    Dense figurative language without pattern payoff: "gravity defier," "fractured timelines," "procedural generation," "darkening brightness," "labyrinth of self" accumulate as labels rather than concrete constraints (density penalty −0.5). Synonym loops cluster around "fractured," "eternal," "self"; template stems "He had to," "He saw," "He reached" recur without variation (template cadence −0.4). Paraphrase loop: "to conquer the labyrinth of self, to find the core of his being" restates without adding pressure (−0.2). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("stood whole, the labyrinth behind him"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice cleanly. Information density is high in the phonograph sequence. However, pervasive scaffold and paraphrase loops dull momentum: "audibly muted save for" / "This audibly muted performance" / "mirrored hush"; "rustle of turning seasons" appears four times with minimal reweighting; "filament of hush" recurs as decorative echo. Synonym churn clusters around silence/hush/stillness. Template cadence runs in the final third: "She [verb]" / "Elara [verb]" across adjacent lines. These patterns accumulate to −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "nurture integrity" appears four times, "layered tranquility" three times, "credibly curious" twice, "progressing laterally" four times, all without reweighting. Template cadence runs appear ("She intuited... She progressed laterally... She fetched... She recalled..."). Stock metaphors ("seed of change") and therapy-speak ("drive for integrity," "collaboration could deepen, not dilute, her solitary purpose") dull peak beats. The ending paragraph is thesis summary rather than image. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: loops, template stems, and register drift total approximately −1.4 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong imagery ("shimmering auroras," "twisted form a question mark"). Several lines loop or restate without added pressure: "He began to trace its length… feeling for a pattern" echoes "search for pattern"; "remembered his imprisonment… for poems" → "decision that haunted his every verse" paraphrases the same backstory beat. Template cadence appears in "He saw… He remembered… He had chosen… He could…" runs. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "texture of time… gritty and resistant like unpolished clay" works, though the metaphor labor is visible. Line-level momentum is solid; these patterns prevent entry into the 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "chronic hush" + "vast silence" + "quiet world" recur without accumulating new pressure. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens five consecutive sentences mid-story. Stock metaphors: "space for contemplation and creation," "eternal dance between sound and silence." The final paragraph stacks summary-mode restatements ("true beauty lies," "magnificent simplicity") that dull the closure image. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.5, stock metaphor strings −0.4, total −1.5 in Q7; artifacts touch closure, disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.3)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "the transformation completed" (three times), "static electricity" (five times without variation), and synonym churn ("subsume," "dissolve," "absorb," "integrate"). Multiple sentences restate the same idea—"half truths had been a cage" is followed by "preventing her from truly connecting." Filter-verb stacks ("she sensed," "she felt," "she realized," "she knew") dull immediacy in peak beats. The final third is especially saturated with loops ("transformation completed" twice in the last six sentences), triggering −1.7 for artifacts touching closure and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops are frequent: "cycles of compassion" appears verbatim multiple times without added pressure, and adjacent sentences restate content (e.g., "uplifting others had filled a void" echoed by "filling her world with purpose"). Template cadence runs across the final third with repetitive "[Character], [state], [past participial phrase]" constructions. Clarity and grammar are clean, but information density is low; many lines summarize weeks of events rather than advancing on-page pressure. Stock metaphors ("beacon," "rippled outward," "shimmer with approval") dull peak beats. These artifacts touch the closure zone, triggering −1.2 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.7)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template structures weaken momentum: "Her motivation was to weave herself into the webs of kinship" immediately follows the prior sentence's same idea; "luminescent ache" appears six times with synonym variations. The phrase "webs of kinship" recurs mechanically (five times) without evolving meaning. Figurative language is dense but often ornamental rather than propulsive ("drink the light and emit a softer, inner glow"). Stock metaphor strings and thesaurus elevation ("pervasive, luminous silence") dull several high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The place where echoes are born was no longer a mystery but a memory" restates prior content without added pressure; "echoes burst forth" / "echoes settled" / "echoes sang" cycles through synonym churn. Template cadence appears in runs: "She [verb]" and "Elara [verb]" openings repeat across at least eight sentences. Stock metaphors ("threads of fate," "like taffy in the sun") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she knew," "she reflected") dull line-level momentum. Applying −0.6 for loops/cadence and −0.4 for filter stacks in peak beats, plus −0.3 for stock phrasing, totaling approximately −1.3 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm and varied sentence structure. Information density is solid in the orchard-work sequence. However, template cadence appears in repeated sentence openings ("Elian [verb]" across multiple beats), and some synonym churn surfaces around "gently inventive" (used three times with slight variation). Figurative language ("ghost in the equations," "fabric of being") occasionally elevates register without always anchoring in concrete perception. The final third summarizes key turns ("he understood that") rather than trusting image and action. No major loops or orientation loss, but momentum softens in the reflective closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.3)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence proliferate: "the cache," "sense memory," "kindly methodical," "ferromagnetic tape reel fragment," and "sapphire hush" recur as near-identical phrases across 15+ lines without added pressure or reweighting. Runs of "He had [verb]" and "His [noun]" create drumbeat rhythm (−0.6). The final third restates the entire premise in summary rather than image: "his kindly methodical efforts had woven him into the city's hidden fabric" (line 29), then "the crawl space dweller had fulfilled his purpose" (line 33), then the closing lines repeat "sapphire hush" and "ferromagnetic tape reel fragment" as checklist confirmation rather than charged reprise. Stock metaphors ("beacon," "bridge gaps") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "knew," "watched") dull immediacy in peak beats. Apply patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.4 for loops and template cadence across closure beats, plus disallow 9+ globally per Q7 rule.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; sensory detail (rain-beaded veins, wet bark, petrichor) advances atmosphere without padding. However, paraphrase loops proliferate: the concept of releasing control is restated across at least five beats ("first stirrings of a reluctant metamorphosis," "terrifying and alien concept," "small action, but it felt monumental," "no longer reluctant," "welcome, ongoing journey"). Template cadence appears in the reflective middle ("Her study… had been flawed," "The true lesson was," "This understanding came"). Stock metaphors ("grinding shift," "raw honesty") and elevated diction ("monumental," "solidarity") clash with the POV's grounded scientist voice. These artifacts dull momentum and touch the closure passage, triggering cumulative penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is largely clear and propulsive, with strong concrete images (slick rocks, tarnished silver chain, amber brooch) and purposeful sensory detail. Rhythm varies, and the opening establishes voice cleanly. However, several loops and scaffolds appear: "He knew he couldn't leave the brooch behind; it felt like a key" is near-paraphrase; "haggard awe" appears twice as a stock phrase; "wryly earnest" is label-repeated rather than shown through distinct syntactic choices. The final third shifts into summary ("He started a new painting," "He slept a little better now") with abstract phrasing ("threads of connection," "amber glow of understanding") that dilutes momentum and specificity. Paraphrase-loop and elevated-diction drift at closure together warrant deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "unseen forces" appears eight times, often in adjacent lines without adding pressure; "steadily unpredictable" and "overlapping shadows" recur as labels. Template cadence in the middle section: "The unseen forces swirled… / Each raindrop glittered… / Kaelen laughed…" Figurative density is high but mixed (shadows "inhabit" light, tone is "bright darkness") without clear metaphor logic. Sentence openings vary but rhythm is sluggish, stacking description over propulsion. Information density is low; many lines restate the same mystical claim.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity is high; syntax and grammar are clean. However, paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "She aimed to hearten... Her method would be... Her role was not just to record, but to navigate..." Adjacent sentences restate concepts (exile's silence mirrored lost connections; its silence represented voices lost). Figurative language ("shards of memory," "fractured spirits," "layered history") clusters without escalation or payoff. The final third deploys stock metaphors ("weight lift," "no longer silence but promise") that dull the closure image. Information density is moderate; many lines scaffold rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "trembling certainty" recurs four times without reweighting, "phantom punch" is restated with near-identical phrasing across multiple beats, and the final third cycles through "renewed," "transformed," "changed," "free," "light" without distinct meaning. Template cadence dominates—runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" across adjacent sentences—and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she knew," "she dared") cluster in high-pressure beats. Stock metaphors ("mist-shrouded streets," "cascade of revelations," "starlit clarity") and elevated diction ("cavernous space," "solidified into peace") clash with the action-adventure frame without voice motivation. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes closure, violating the show-through-action principle at the story's peak.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "unheard symphony" appears seven times, often in adjacent paragraphs without evolving meaning. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("Each stroke revealed," "The process felt like," "As she worked"). Stock metaphors ("bubble of tranquility," "tapestry") and filter-verb stacks ("felt a pull," "felt the truth," "felt a profound connection") dull immediacy in peak beats. The final five paragraphs recycle closure gestures in synonym churn, restating the same emotional note without propulsion or new information.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally sound, but the prose suffers from paraphrase loops: "spatial mutiny" is restated four times across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure, and "intrigue" appears six times as a stock placeholder. Figurative density is high ("drink the prismatic light," "silent origami," "kaleidoscope of broken geometries") but metaphors do not cohere—light both fractures and coalesces without clear logic. Sentence openings repeat patterns ("The intrigue began," "The intrigue deepened," "The hushed thunder of") in a template cadence. Information density is moderate; many lines restate stakes rather than advancing action.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.2)
    Line-level clarity is adequate, but the prose suffers from pervasive scaffold and template cadence: repeated sentence stems ("Leo's motivation was," "The ink pot sat beside him," "Days later, news came") and paraphrase loops ("The breach was mental, not physical—a crack in the system widened by waiting and wisdom" restates the prior beat without new pressure). Stock metaphors ("his tone shifting from stone to stream," "where endings bred new beginnings") replace concrete imagery, and thematic labels ("deathly vitality," "liquefies rigid thinking") recur as shortcuts rather than embodied perception. Information density is low—many sentences restate rather than advance (e.g., the final paragraph's four variations on "the ink pot's work was done"). The climactic exchange tells emotional shifts ("Leo saw his rigid thinking liquefy") rather than showing physical or verbal behavior that would let the reader infer change.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clean and grammatical with varied sentence openings and purposeful rhythm in descriptive passages. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "the textures of different times" recurs without added pressure; "earnestly studious" is restated; "invented histories" and "narratives built from echoes" restate the same idea. Template cadence in the workshop paragraph ("These volumes held... They were not... His earnestly studious nature...") flattens momentum. The final paragraph stacks summary lines ("The cycle was eternal... In this way... He was the keeper...") without propulsion, triggering a cumulative −0.8 deduction for loops and scaffold in the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop conceptually: "filtered reality" / "layer" / "texture" / "fragments" recur without new specificity. The closing paragraph contains mild paraphrase ("his identity still nameless in the world, but now vividly real to himself" restates the stakes without advancing them). Figurative language is dense but controlled; no major clarity breaks. Sentence openings vary and the prose propels accumulation cleanly, but the conceptual redundancy and scaffold at closure prevent higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "retell" and "retold" appear nine times with synonym churn ("reimagined," "revisited"). Template cadence runs dominate the middle ("She retold...She spoke...She held...She played..."). The final third stacks declarative summary sentences without propulsion: "The painted seashell glowed briefly...Elara set down...The universal riddle was decoded...She had retold her tale..." Figurative language ("whisper of closing pages," "cradle for dying dreams") appears frequently but mixed metaphors do not cohere. Line-level artifacts touch closure beats, disqualifying 9+ globally and dragging momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.1)
    Applying artifact penalties: paraphrase loops (−0.2), template cadence in mid-section (−0.4), and repetitive key-phrase anchors without variance (−0.2) total roughly −0.8 in Q7. Base functionality around 6.9 minus accumulation yields 6.1. The closure beat itself remains clear, so heavier penalties do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and sentences advance scene momentum cleanly. No loops, scaffolding, or contradictory metaphors. Information density is solid: most lines do double duty (setting, mood, character). However, stock phrasing appears in peak beats: "wave of dawnlit melancholy washed over her," "sea of change," "last whisper of a Moon." The template stem "She [verb]" recurs in the final paragraph without pattern-teaching. Figurative language in high-pressure moments (dawn arrival, shutter press) dilutes specificity rather than sharpening it, triggering −0.5 for density and −0.3 for stock metaphor strings in closure vicinity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is high and grammar clean, but several text-artifact patterns appear: synonym loops ("decode the feedback" / "decoding it into direction"), redundant restatements ("Though blind, she saw the success" echoes earlier "seeing nothing...but everything of its essence"), and template stems ("She decided," "She placed," "She applied," "She carried"). The repair sequence lists steps without propulsion or complication. Stock metaphors ("gentle as a lover's caress," "ghostly shroud") and elevated diction ("testament to her craft") do not arise from POV stress. Final paragraph recaps theme rather than driving forward.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax, but several passages loop or paraphrase: "worrying tranquility, a calm so deep it felt like the prelude to storm" restates itself, and multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" in the first half. Stock metaphors appear ("desert under a pallid sky," "icy hush") without fresh coloring. The closure beat—"steam curled from the stone, melting the surrounding snow into a small, nascent stream"—is concrete and propulsive, which saves the score from dropping further. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he knew") cluster in reflective beats but remain within acceptable density for voice.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.3)
    Syntax varies purposefully, and paragraph rhythm supports the ritual pacing. Information density is moderate; many lines restate progress without advancing stakes (e.g., "He was rebuilding not structures, but the very essence of connection" rephrases prior claims). A paraphrase-loop appears: "The wild hush deepened" / "The wild hush broke" recycles the anchor without new pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: "He [verb]… He [verb]… He [verb]…" across multiple sentences. Stock metaphors appear without fresh inflection: "the fabric of reality," "testament to revival." No major clarity break, but accumulation of minor redundancies and scaffold phrasing dulls momentum. Apply −0.6 for loop and template patterns per Q7 guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "lonesome splendor" appears four times, "gathered hush" five times, "distress signal" four times, often in adjacent or near-adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the middle third ("He had to...His every instinct...But he knew...The mechanism was..."). Stock metaphors cluster: "river of quiet," "cold blanket," "whisper of that silence." Register is uniform and elevated, with no sentence-level propulsion variation during the escape. The final seven paragraphs summarize future years rather than closing on image, diluting closure momentum. Apply cumulative artifact penalty (−1.2) and disallow 9+ per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.9)
    Purple prose clusters in key beats: "tapestry of distrust that clung to Kaelen like damp salt air," "copperlight repose," "hover, as spectral wardens." Paraphrase loops surface ("the impossibilities around him shuddered, the very air thickening" / "the attribute that sustained impossibilities waned"). Template stems recur ("He ascended… He knew… He stood"). The lattice "vibrated, its grooves aligning" reads as convenient rather than earned causality. Figurative density obscures momentum in the climb sequence, and the beacon's mechanics ("fueled by stories") remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.5)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports pacing. Information density is adequate but some lines loop: "mournful elation" appears twice, "resonant awakenings" three times as a label without varied embodiment, and "lovingly venomous" is repeated identically. Template cadence appears in mid-story beats: "She would glide...," "He felt...," "Elian clutched...," "The ghost bride smiled..." (subject–verb opener runs). Clarity is high and no causality breaks occur. The final image ("endless night...peaceful, not oppressive") tells rather than shows the tonal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops. Lines like "She was the poetic wharf weaver, her soul tuned to the rhythms of the sea and stone" and "Her motivation was singular and profound: to carve a path from ruin to reverence" read as scaffold exposition rather than scene-embedded narration. The sewing sequence repeats synonyms for the same action ("sewing was a response," "began to sew in earnest," "continued to sew") without advancing pressure. Stock metaphors ("hope that lingered like a ghost," "poetry of motion") and filter-verb stacks ("She felt hauntingly optimistic," "She felt the orchid solace") dull immediacy. Mixed registers appear: "re-enchanting" and "testament" clash with the concrete "needle and thread." The closure beat—"the poetic wharf weaver's promise fulfilled"—summarizes rather than dramatizes, and the final paragraph loops thematically without new information.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear and grammatically clean, but suffers from template cadence and paraphrase loops. Multiple sentences begin with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" across adjacent lines, creating rhythmic monotony. Key beats are summarized rather than dramatized: "Over days that bled into weeks, Elara began excavating" compresses the central action into a transit phrase. Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh tension ("warmly curious heart," "living tapestry," "breathing again in the world"). The final paragraph loops thematic claims ("faith was rebuilt," "interrupted journeys," "digging for truth") in near-synonym variations that dilute rather than sharpen closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "carefully inventive grace" / "carefully inventive approach," "ebony clipboard" appears four times with identical phrasing, and "meaning in the margins" recurs as a label. Sentence openings converge on subject-verb and prepositional stems ("She was," "She carefully," "She checked," "She dropped," "She smiled"). Template cadence across the middle third flattens momentum. Stock metaphors ("corridor of gold," "silent war") and a thesaurus-inflated phrase ("juxtapose the overt message with the hidden one") dilute clarity. Artifacts touch multiple beats; applying combined deductions yields −1.4 in Q7 and disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies across beats, and information density is high in the embroidery sequences. The opening's sensory specificity ("crisp and golden," "dark fabric stretched taut") and the candle-extinguishing closure carry strong propulsion. However, scaffold sentences appear mid-story: "This was how she worked" and "Her true work was not simply to map the heavens, but to use the threads as a conduit" are explanatory paraphrases that summarize mechanics already shown. Template cadence surfaces in several "She [verb], [gerund]" constructions. One metaphor ("conspiracies that coiled like vipers") is functional but stock. These artifacts cluster in the second quarter, dulling momentum before the captain's entrance; the closure beat remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentence openings show variety, but the prose carries multiple loops and scaffold patterns that dull momentum: "unsent letters" appears six times with similar framing, "fierce tenderness" recurs four times as a label without evolving embodiment, and synonym churn around "evoke/evocation" (four instances) flattens the peak beats. Paraphrase loop between "The unsent letters in her heart seemed to rustle" and "The unsent letters were her own prison" restates concept without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the second half: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" without variation (−0.4). Mixed metaphor: "fierce tenderness" as both "a protective, aching love" and later "like a shield" blurs vehicle coherence without clear payoff (−0.3). These artifacts touch the closure beat ("carrying the fierce tenderness like a shield"), triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (shard description + emotional effect), but key closure moments summarize rather than propel.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("cold tide pulling her from the sharp edges of the world," "evening's bruised purple light"), but multiple beats stack metaphor without propulsion: the opening paragraph layers four distinct images in rapid succession, blurring focus. Paraphrase loops appear: "unknotting them for both of them, thread by psychic thread" restates the prior sentence's "untying a knot in a tangled rope." The decryption sequence summarizes rather than dramatizes each beat, reducing information density. Template cadence runs occur in the middle third ("The first mark was… Next, a series… Then, a word…"), flattening rhythm at a key escalation point.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with vivid images (skeletal apple tree, vibrant blues and golds). Rhythm varies and information density is adequate. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She saw the world not just in pigment, but in luminescence and shadow" is immediately restated in "This piece was like exposed film, holding a latent image." Template cadence runs in the middle third: multiple paragraphs open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]." Figurative density in non-peak beats (daydream fold, phantom orchard, seed in dormant earth) risks overwriting without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "nested awakenings" is restated at least five times with synonyms (first, second, another, infinite, final awakening); "curiosity" and "certainty" are cycled repeatedly. Template cadence runs through the middle third with identical subject-verb stems ("She realized," "She knew," "She felt"). Figurative language is dense without payoff: "methodically playful" appears three times as decoration, "bewitch" twice, "reflected sound" in every other beat. The final paragraph stacks summary ("her work was done, but her journey had just begun") and closes with a redundant coda after the coin vanishes. Information density is low; most sentences restate atmosphere rather than advance causality.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "Each arrangement spelled out warnings or coordinates" immediately follows "message patterns using specific herbs and flowers." Template cadence dominates action beats ("She shook… She led… She scattered…"). Mixed metaphors weaken clarity ("vines twisted into unnatural shapes" while "time seemed to stutter like a broken record" conflates spatial and temporal distortion). Stock phrases ("Her motivation was simple yet profound," "precious flame") pad without advancing. These artifacts pervade the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "centuries of longing" appears five times, "shyly unstoppable" three times, "photosynthesize pain into beauty" four times, often within adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs through multiple "The [noun]" and "His [noun]" openings. Figurative density is high but muddles without pattern payoff—"reef-shadow joy" is coined, repeated, then glossed rather than charged through action. Scaffold sentences ("This artifact whispered," "The core concept") stall momentum, and the final third stacks these artifacts into the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is mostly clear, but several artifacts drag momentum. "Foxglove regret" is repeated three times with identical phrasing and no evolving meaning. The phrase "museum of extinct feelings" and "deserted marvels" loop across the text as labels rather than active images. Template cadence appears in the tablet-search sequence: "She moved with a gently systematic precision, scanning rows…After what felt like an age, she found it." The final paragraph summarizes rather than propels, restating the opening vigil without fresh pressure. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and label-stack; −0.3 for template cadence in non-closure beat; total −0.9 within Q7 per artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.6)
    Template cadence pervades the middle section with repeated "She wrote/began/remembered" stems and paraphrase loops (promises are described, then their effect is re-stated). Stock metaphors ("towering shelves," "tangled web," "heart pounding") appear in high-pressure beats without fresh specificity. The glass ink well "pulsed rhythmically, as if in tune with her heartbeat" mixes vehicle and tenor awkwardly. Clarity remains intact but information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies, but several beats suffer from template cadence and paraphrase loops: "Her tools were simple... Her innate curiosity" / "The message... was slyly heartfelt; it spoke of... This act... resonated" / "She had not just fixed... she had woven." Stock metaphors ("heart light," "weighted with history and hope," "living truth") cluster in the final third and dull the closure image. Register drift into poetic abstraction ("dappled resolve," "encrypted compassion") clashes with the technical machinist framing. Filter-verb stacks in peak beats ("she felt," "she knew," "she whispered") reduce immediacy. Total deduction in Q7: approximately −1.4 for loops, stock phrasing, and filter stacks; disallow 9+ globally per artifact policy.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops: paragraphs 2–3 restate her invented history; paragraphs 6–7 repeat the meteorite's symbolic function. Template cadence: "She had…," "Her motivation was…," "This method…" stack in the opening without variation. Scaffold phrases ("Among her possessions," "Over the weeks," "In the end") signal outline seams. The closure paragraph stacks four declarative summary sentences that explain rather than show. Information density is low; many lines restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.9)
    Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the piece: "necessary distances" and "sacred thresholds" are restated across nearly every paragraph without added pressure. Template cadence appears in runs like "She intuited… She realized… She knew…" which flatten momentum. The figurative language is dense but often strained ("featherly determined" is used four times without clarification; "fractured hush" becomes a refrain without deepening). Stock metaphors ("doors to becoming," "bridges") replace concrete image at closure. Mid-story scaffolding ("This intuition sharpened," "Now, adrift on this terrace") externalizes transitions rather than integrating them into action. Information density is low—many lines restate prior claims without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear frequently: the burnt feather is "captivated her immediately" then "pulled her into a mystery," and belonging is restated across three final paragraphs. Template cadence runs through multiple "She [verb]" stems without variation. Stock metaphors ("canvas of black," "rhythm of belonging") lack fresh specificity. The final third contains heavy scaffold ("She realized that," "She knew she would carry," "She felt the rhythm") that summarizes rather than dramatizes. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering elevated penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is largely clear and grammatically clean, with purposeful vocabulary. Paraphrase loops appear: "cheerful gloom" recurs four times without functional variation; "conjecture" is repeated across adjacent beats without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle section with repeated sentence stems ("He conjectured that…," "The seeds… released," "Kaelen realized"). Figurative language is frequent but occasionally strained ("transliterated his own emotion of determination" mixes metaphorical registers). Information density is moderate; many sentences restate the discovery theme rather than advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and rhythm varies, but the prose carries significant scaffold and paraphrase loops. Multiple adjacent lines restate the same idea: "orchestrated serendipity" / "make magic happen not by chance" / "ordering randomness into a delicate, believable illusion" / "calculated wilderness" / "carefully choreographed chaos"—all name the same concept without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the final third with repeated "she [verb]" and "the [noun] [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors ("crimson snow," "ancient light," "tiny totem") and elevated abstractions ("modern alchemy," "endless campaign") cluster without grounding. The Text Artifact Screen triggers a −0.6 deduction for paraphrase loops and synonym churn that dull momentum, and an additional −0.3 for template cadence, totaling roughly −0.9 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive overwriting: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence ("tapestry of starlight and soul," "dark elegance that enveloped her like a second skin," "the obsidian embrace of the cosmos") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density and register penalties. Paraphrase loops recur: "her exile was a protest" / "her exile had become her strength." Template cadence is visible in repeated "She [verb]" stems across multiple paragraphs. Mixed metaphor: "obsidian grace" is applied as mood, texture, and companion without coherent vehicle. Propulsion stalls under ornament; many lines restate mood rather than advance action.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and purposeful figurative language ("dawn bled light," "mist coiling around her ankles"). Information density is high in sensory passages. However, the middle section contains paraphrase loops: "She came here to commune… with the essence of things, with the light and the silence" restates the prior sentence's concept without added pressure. The final paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("reckoning," "shift," "pattern," "value") and edges toward thematic summary ("not ordinary; they were the fundamental elements…") rather than propulsive image. Apply −0.6 for loops and register drift in peak beats; no artifact touches the closure beat directly but dulls momentum approaching it.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "translate pain into a universal language" appears four times with minimal variation; "hard softness" recurs without reweighting; "slow dance of celestial bodies" is repeated verbatim. Template cadence is evident in repeated stems: "She [verb]," "The [noun] was [adjective]," "During this [noun]." Rhythm is uniform, lacking propulsion or sentence-level variance. Information density is low—many lines restate the same reflective content. Figurative language ("ribbon between dark forest and star-strewn sky") is vivid but does not advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, with varied sentence structure and vivid imagery ("sea-smoothed stones," "blue sea glass," "luminous kelp"). However, several phrases loop or paraphrase: "trial balloons" recurs descriptively without evolving use, and the pattern of "she noted / adjusted / felt a shift" repeats across paragraphs two and three. Figurative language is dense without always advancing pressure: "decorative equation," "whisper of music," "wave of quiet transformation" stack metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she sensed," "she watched") cluster in high-detail beats, dulling immediacy. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the closure, lowering propulsion. No major grammatical errors, but the density of abstract metaphor and repeated syntactic templates (subject-verb-object observation) reduces line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure and strong concrete nouns (ivy, moss, ash, fireplace). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "walls absorbed emotions...dreaming them back" in paragraph six echoes "walls dream" from the opening; "burden was now partly hers" repeats the burden motif three times in adjacent lines near the end. Template cadence runs ("She believed...She understood...She knew") across middle paragraphs create mild monotony. The closure beat includes scaffold phrasing ("ready to be part of a new map") that dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the text is grammatically clean, but paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Her perceptive calm allowed her to notice the subtle shifts" echoes "Lyra's grace was not just in her movement but in her patience"; "through coded lullabies" repeats as "embedding new codes"; "the mirrors trembled slightly" / "the first mirror shimmered" recycle the same beat without added pressure. Information density is low—many lines restate mood or setting without advancing choice. Figurative language ("threads in her tapestry of illusions," "canvas ready for her to paint upon") stacks without coherent vehicle logic. Apply −1.2 for loops, template cadence, and mixed metaphor clusters across the text, with −0.3 additional for filter-verb stacks in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "the price of redemption" appears three times; "anchor ideals in practice" twice; "operatively gentle" three times; "flawed beauty" twice; "slow dance of celestial bodies" twice. Template cadence dominates: "She was a peace negotiator... She had come... She needed to muster... She remembered... She smiled..." runs through the piece. Stock metaphors cluster: "fragile and beautiful, like a spiderweb glistening with dew," "light blending into a single, luminous orb." The final paragraph summarizes rather than shows: "In the years that followed..." deflates closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "an amoral philanthropist, a man who funded...with one hand while orchestrating...with the other" repeats the amoral/contradiction idea seven times across the piece ("carefully hidden even from himself," "secretly sentimental," "buried beneath layers," "his amoral nature argued," etc.). Template cadence in early paragraphs: "He was X...his motivation...the salt flat...these deep, jagged fissures...Elias moved" stacks subject-verb stems. Mixed metaphor: light "pulsed, flowing into the cracks...like water seeking its course" conflates luminous and liquid. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff; most sentences carry metaphor. Clarity remains intact, so artifact penalties stay in Q7 per routing.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dense figurative language in nearly every sentence ("pale ghosts," "spectral threads," "constellation of lost voices," "shimmering nexus of light and sound") without pattern-teaching or payoff, violating the overwriting density threshold. Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "her existence was a performance" / "her story now her own to write"; "defiance" / "defiant" / "defying" recycled across beats. Template cadence runs: "It was said to be… Her motivation was… Her goal was… The method… The harvest…" Synonym churn: "chaste," "serene," "alarming serenity," "oppressive silence." Filter-verb stack in the final third: "she understood," "she could feel," "she had come," "she began." Artifacts touch closure ("her story now her own to write"), triggering −1.7 baseline plus disallow-9+ globally and 8.8 cap per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade adjacent sentences: "The dome's interior… filled with her calligraphy scrolls" / "She moved to a small table"; "She decided to reverse" / "This shift felt radical"; "As she worked, the meteor hush deepened" / "She recalled how half-lit epiphanies often emerged." Template cadence runs dominate: "She [verb]" opens six consecutive sentences in the second half. Stock metaphors ("rising from ashes," "faint stars in a polluted sky") and prompt-phrase repetition ("half-lit epiphanies," "meteor hush," "uncommonly serene") recur without variation. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("her story was still being written"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 (−1.2 baseline in Q7, escalated to −1.7 for closure presence).

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and sentences open diversely. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmosphere more than dual function. "Blushing stillness" recurs, and "transiently rooted" is repeated verbatim, bordering on scaffold. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "He intended," "He began," "He tied," "He recalled"—a run of subject-verb stems that flattens propulsion. Mixed metaphor in "knot this wing into a temporary signal" (knot ≠ signal) briefly muddles sense. No major loops, but figurative density in non-peak beats (e.g., "time's relentless march," "great rhythm") leans stock.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity and rhythm are generally strong, with sensory detail woven through action. However, paraphrase loops appear: "preserve the sound" / "let them resonate," "technically gentle" repeated without deepening, and synonym churn around "names" (identities, voices, forgotten names) without added pressure. "Snowmelt ardor" appears three times as a thematic badge rather than evolving meaning. Template cadence in several paragraphs ("She [verb]... She [verb]...") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she understood," "she saw") dull immediacy in key beats, triggering −0.6 for patterned artifacts and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.6)
    Line-level clarity is generally maintained, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and thematic echo. Multiple sentences restate transcendence and freedom without added pressure: "To transcend...was not to leave the world behind, but to move through it completely" followed by "she found the ultimate freedom" and "a monument to release." Template cadence is evident in the closing paragraph's repetitive "The storm raged on...The bunker...She had discovered..." Figurative language is dense throughout ("ribbon of light," "swirling light," "grand, ethereal song") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. The thematic summary "Why paths choose their walkers was no longer a question, but a lived truth" in the penultimate paragraph is explicit moralizing that replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and template phrasing accumulate: "dusky harmony" appears three times, "encrypted devotion" and "schematic representations" recur as labels without variation, and adjacent sentences restate the same idea ("This tile was the key… a love for the divine… coded into architecture and art" / "devotion was not for a god, but for the universe itself, a love encrypted in mathematics and art"). Sentence stems cluster around "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" patterns across a dozen lines. Mixed metaphor: "burning brighter than any comet" for motivation, then "fading like a dying star" for the palace, muddling the celestial vehicle. Elevated diction ("coalescing," "poignant," "testament") drifts above the POV's established practical register at peak beats. Cumulative −1.4 for loops, stems, and register drift; no severe clarity break but momentum drags.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose carries numerous synonym loops ("shifting grace of the sanctuary," "shifting grace enveloped him," "Shifting grace had transformed him") and template cadence ("She believed... She held... She aimed..."). Stock metaphors pervade: "sinking stone in a flowing stream," "edges of his hardened heart." Register drifts into abstraction ("primal recollections stored in his very cells," "tangible link to his past") during peak beats. Propulsion stalls as concepts are restated without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clean and grammatical with varied sentence openings. Information density is moderate; many sentences do one job without layering. Template cadence appears in the ritual sequence: "The synchronized breathing created… In the mirrors, Elian saw… The tone was… The runaway dream drew… Elian used…" across six consecutive moves (−0.5). Figurative language ("like brittle bones," "diamond-like sparks," "glass mountains") clusters without muddle but leans decorative. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "accidental wisdom" and "deciduous vows" are repeated across adjacent lines without added pressure, and multiple sentences restate Elara's realization that she must listen to Lyra. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("She polished… She read… She realized… She persisted"). Register drifts into abstract diction ("adaptable vows," "unintended wisdom") that clashes with the protagonist's hands-on craft. The final third stacks summary sentences that deflate momentum rather than propel toward closure. Minor stock metaphors ("like sap through the trees") and the overuse of "accidental" as a modifier further reduce clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is clear and grammatically clean, but suffers from repetitive phrasing: "brightened disquiet" appears three times, "nonlinear inheritance" twice, "pistachio shell cameo blank" in full each time, and "between the first and last page" bookends without reweighting. Several sentences open with "The" or "She" in runs, creating template cadence. Figurative language ("cold star," "meteor," "dance of knowledge") accumulates without pattern-teaching or sharp payoff, and the final paragraph's "infinite dance of knowledge" and "hard-won peace" read as abstract summary rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean and grammatical with varied sentence openings and no glaring loops. Information density is moderate—several beats (diary retrieval, decode, floating books, ritual) advance causality, but connective tissue ("After the time traveler arrived, everything changed") relies on summary scaffolding. Template cadence appears in the setup ("She stood within…her motivation was singular…") and the tone claims ("The tone of their quest was like an unheard symphony") tell rather than enact the rhythm. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops touch the closure, keeping the score in mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong images (carousel horse, emerald glow, fog thickening). However, paraphrase loops appear: "a patchwork of memories and identities that never quite settled" and "dual DNA that made her a discoverer of her own hidden truth" restate the same core idea. Template cadence in the middle third ("She needed... So she focused... That was when...") costs −0.4. The closure beat avoids artifacts, capping the non-closure penalty at −0.4 total.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity is high; no major loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary. Information density is moderate: many lines do one job (describe), fewer do two. The peak beat—rope reconfiguration—leans on abstract verbs: "absorbing," "glowed," "solidify," "dissolving." Figurative language is present but not dense enough to trigger overwriting penalties. The phrase "warmly methodical" recurs three times as a label without evolving. Propulsion is steady but not urgent; the prose breathes evenly rather than accelerating at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but multiple sentences open with similar structures ("Elara [verb]," "The [noun]," "She [verb]") creating mild template cadence. Paraphrase loops appear: "gently luminous" recurs five times without evolving function; "hammered repose" is stated twice in close succession (penultimate and final paragraphs) without new pressure. Stock metaphors ("parched earth drinks rain," "sleeping child") and label-heavy phrasing ("profound connection," "ethereal clarity") dull immediacy in peak beats. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff. Information density is moderate; some lines restate prior content (e.g., the echo chamber stone's glow is described multiple times). These artifacts touch the closure third, disallowing 9+ globally and applying −1.0 cumulative penalty in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong images ("glass humming pavilion," "pinprick of light sparked"). Information density is good; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. However, several paraphrase loops and stock phrases appear: "a simple act of care that felt like a prophecy" and "the universe whispering its secrets" are generic; "thistle-blown hope" recurs three times without reweighting; "visions that came unbidden like ghosts" is cliché. The final paragraph summarizes closure ("she had rekindled more than a beacon") rather than trusting the image. Figurative language is dense but mostly functional; no major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level clarity is solid; spatial choreography tracks. Paragraph structure varies purposefully. However, numerous paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs weaken momentum: "He needed to conjecture, to form a theory" restates the same idea; "This elongation, he suspected, was a key" and "He conjectured that identity wasn't carved" repeat the conjecture label without varied syntax. Stock metaphors ("threads in the fabric," "whispers rising like steam") cluster without fresh specificity. Filter-verb reliance ("he noted," "he suspected," "he felt," "he realized") dulls immediacy in peak beats. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence; −0.3 for stock metaphor strings; total −0.9 in Q7, capping below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "filter the despair" / "filtering essence of sorrow," "defying the void" / "defiance for those who see," "blooming fortress" / "cradle of radiance." Template cadence runs dominate ("He [verb], his [noun]…" × 8 lines). Stock metaphors cluster without specificity: "transient flower," "cascade of azure and gold," "symphony of light." The final third is thick with synonym churn ("serious playfulness" × 3, "ambient awareness" × 4), triggering −1.2 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is maintained and sensory language is often vivid, but the prose suffers from paraphrase loops and redundancy. The cicada's emergence and molting metaphor is repeated across multiple beats without added pressure; "transition" and "texture of time" appear as near-synonyms throughout. Template cadence is evident: "Elara watched," "Elara turned," "Elara smiled," "Elara placed," "Elara knew" in quick succession. Figurative density is high—almost every sentence in the middle third carries metaphor or abstraction—without always advancing momentum. Several lines restate content: "The pause… became a space" followed immediately by "The pause… had found its resolution."

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The opening effectively anchors voice and stakes. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "pressing weight of the earth" and "reinforced walls felt like a slowly closing fist" restate claustrophobia; "intangibly tangible" recurs without evolution; "stretching contracted" appears twice as a thematic claim. The phrase "defined her entire quest" and "the memory of the gilded hush was a shield" abstract key moments rather than dramatizing them through image and action. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks, but minor redundancy and summary phrasing dull momentum at pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: adjacent sentences restate the same content without added pressure (e.g., "This was the moment she lived for, the silence she aimed to shape" followed by "Her motivation was clear: to teach silence how to comfort"). Template cadence runs dominate the middle third ("She was," "She felt," "She thought"). The phrase "catalyze" appears three times in ten lines without varied syntax. Figurative language ("vaulting hush," "storm glass vial") is stock rather than fresh. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the disqualification from 9+ and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "futuristic nostalgia for a past she had only read about" rephrases the lore-keeper premise; "the unclaimed throne" appears six times with minimal variation; "wisely adventurous" is repeated in identical phrasing. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb], [result]" structures recur across a dozen sentences. Filter verbs and abstract labels cluster in peak beats ("felt like an eternity," "mix of hope and nostalgia"). Figurative language is functional but often stock ("beacon of unity," "testament to the journey"). Information density is low; many lines restate rather than advance. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("feeling the weight… but also the joy"), triggering the cross-category 9+ disqualifier and the −1.7 Q7 penalty for closure-beat contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high but purposeful in establishing tone; "loaded emptiness," "fading thresholds," and "burns bridges carefully" recur without mixed metaphors. Template cadence appears: multiple sentences open with "He + past verb" or "The + noun," creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops are minimal. The final paragraph's "not just taught a lesson; he had learned one" is scaffolding that could be cut. Information density is moderate; several beats restate theme without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overwriting pervades: "profound pressure," "eternally beautiful," "breathtaking dance of light and dark," "silent applause for the alchemy of resilience." Template cadence runs through the climax: "He visualized... He poured... He opened... He held..." Paraphrase loops appear ("crystallizing into tangible forms" / "concept became physical"). The final third stacks declarative summary ("his journey... complete, ready for whatever... forever changed") without propulsion. Mixed metaphor: concepts "crystallize" and "solidify" interchangeably.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops dominate: "He remembered… Now, he sought… wondering if…" restates the same inquiry across adjacent lines (−0.2). Template cadence runs appear ("He reached… As he wound… He placed…") without variation (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("bridge of intuition," "golden shadows") and therapy-speak ("his muse deepening," "emotional introspective state") cluster in peak beats (−0.6). The final third is saturated with summary and synonym churn ("seeker of justice," "dynasty healer," "figure reborn"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8. Sentence openings repeat "He" and "The" mechanically. Information density is low; many lines restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "murmured allegiance" appears six times, "shivering bliss" four times, "capture the shape of possibility" three times, and "factually mystical" twice, often in identical syntactic slots without added pressure or reweighting. Template cadence runs through the middle: "He [verb], [result]" structures repeat across eight consecutive sentences. Stock metaphors ("flame in the endless night," "door deep within his soul") and elevated diction ("crystallized maybe," "swirling visions of what might be") cluster in peak beats without embodiment. Information density is low—many sentences restate prior content (e.g., the program's purpose is asserted four times). The final paragraph recycles all key phrases, reading as a thematic checklist rather than propulsion. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.4 for loops, template cadence, and stock phrasing that touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high in discovery beats. Minor template patterns appear: "She [verb]" openers recur across five consecutive paragraphs mid-story without taught pattern. The phrase "small kindnesses" is recycled three times without reweighting, and "dust patterns" appears in paraphrase loops ("The dust here was not mere neglect; it was a palimpsest of time" / "The dust patterns showed these letters had been rarely... handled"). Final paragraph moralizes rather than landing on image. Proofreading is clean and grammar solid, but figurative density ("hollow quiet that echoed," "fragile hope," "bright spot") clusters in exposition without pressure payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "revised histories" appears eight times, "phone booth key" six, "auric lagoon under starlight" four, "carefully resourceful" three, "tyranny of indifference" four, "coded freedom" three, "plans unravel" three, "hold the line" four, "puddle reflections" three, "reappear" six. Template cadence dominates ("He aimed to," "He pocketed," "He inserted," "He felt," "He withdrew," "He knew"). Mixed metaphors: "whispers of change spread" while "seeds of doubt" are "planted" and "chains of apathy" are "broken." Figurative density without payoff in most sentences of key beats. Stock phrases: "ripple in stagnant waters," "guardian of truth," "testament to resilience." Artifacts touch closure and pervade dialogue-free narration, triggering −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and the imagery is vivid in places ("dewdrops formed like tiny pearls," "prism atrium's mist swirled"), but pervasive text-pattern artifacts undercut momentum. Paraphrase loops appear throughout: "vested hush" is defined, then redefined, then declared again in the final paragraph; "eerie nostalgia" appears five times, often in identical syntactic slots; "as dewdrops formed" opens three separate beats without variation. Template cadence dominates the middle third: "He [verb]... The [noun] [verb]... Elias [verb]..." Figurative language is frequent but often generic ("protective blanket," "ghost of memories") and mixed (the hush is both a blanket and a force, the prophecy both a whisper and a code). These artifacts cluster in peak beats and the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same concept (silence, hush, quiet) without adding pressure or detail.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "emerged transformed always" appears five times with no variation in meaning, and adjacent sentences restate content ("The folklore spoke of a cycle... Elara realized she was that guardian"). Template cadence runs dominate transitions ("During the hush," "With a [adjective] prod," "She continued"), creating a drumbeat rhythm that dulls propulsion. The phrase "mossy delight" is repeated without concrete anchoring—moss appears as description but never as a tactile, handled object that constrains action. Stock metaphors ("canvas of stars," "heartbeat through the arbor") and filter-verb stacks in reflective passages reduce immediacy, and the final third becomes a summary catalogue of outcomes rather than sentence-level advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "uncertainly certain" appears twice with similar phrasing; "befriend uncertainty" recurs four times in near-identical constructions; "state of being," "patterns emerge," and "flow over fixation" echo across the final third. Template cadence in the resolution ("She realized that," "She understood that," "She had learned") flattens momentum. Mixed metaphor: "swirling leaves" seed the compass discovery but reappear arbitrarily in the final line without dramatized connection. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for metaphor muddle in closure zone, totaling −1.1 in Q7; additionally disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; sentences like "This was not a search for a body, but for meaning" and "the breaking was necessary, a beautiful flaw in the process of becoming" advance theme and pressure. Minor loop: "The coin, for all its recorded potency, had limits she had never tested, protocols she had never dared to breach" paraphrases testing limits without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph: "To redeem... was to define... was to accept... was to redeem" cycles through infinitive structures. Overwriting cluster in peak beats: "luminous regret," "beautiful flaw," "more resonant identity," "luminous peace" stack figurative language in the closure without pattern-teaching, reducing clarity slightly (−0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "modestly fearless" appears three times, "luminous ache" four times, "hidden sunrise" three times, "crocodile's tooth" five times, often in identical syntactic slots without added pressure. Template cadence dominates the final third: "She knew… She walked… Her… Through the… The… For now…" runs eight consecutive paragraph-initial declaratives. Lines 30–43 form a scaffold summary restating the premise without advancing situation or emotion. Mixed metaphor: "amplified every sound, but now it was silent" (line 3) contradicts itself. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph (lines 30–43), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity is strong; spatial choreography tracks cleanly (grove, stream, strap discovery). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during trauma-response beats and opening during reflection. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "bracing" recurs formulaically across multiple paragraphs without evolving pressure (−0.3). "The mathematics of mercy" is restated three times in similar phrasing, bordering on conceptual redundancy (−0.2). Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster in mid-scene but remain voice-appropriate. Information density is high; no major scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is clear and grammatically clean, but paraphrase loops proliferate: "between childhood and now" appears four times, "anchors of intuition" five times, "elusively tangible" twice, "eternal instant" six times. Template cadence appears in repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" sentence openers across adjacent lines. Key phrases like "unfasten the secrets time had buried" and "woven back into the world's tapestry" tilt toward stock metaphor. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance setting or interiority—but the closure paragraph cycles through summary statements ("her work was never done," "made the world more whole") that rephrase prior content. These artifacts cluster but do not fully obscure causality, so penalty remains in Q7 per routing rules.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clarity and grammar are sound; no pronoun confusion or tense drift. However, paraphrase loops abound: "The silence felt heavier, more profound" immediately after "the quiet would change everything"; "cracks in the façade" appears three times with near-identical phrasing; "weightless burden" recurs five times without evolution. Template cadence is pervasive—"He [verb]" opens at least a dozen sentences, creating drumbeat monotony. The final paragraph stacks summary statements ("He was just a repairman... He mended the past... The weightless burden was his to bear") that dull the closure image. Apply −1.2 for loops, template runs, and closure-beat summary stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (glass trees, bottled whisper, sea of clouds) remains coherent. Information density is high in the opening third. However, the final third lapses into paraphrase loops: "The rustling awakenings intensified" / "rustling awakenings threatened to overwhelm" / "rustling awakenings that reminded her"; "compress eternity into a moment" / "compressing eternity had not captured it" / "compressing and expanding moments." Template cadence appears in lines 21–28 with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" stems. No filter-verb stacks or register drift, but the loops dull closure momentum. Deduction: −0.6 for paraphrase and template runs touching the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is largely clear and grammatically clean, with purposeful rhythm in the opening ("time had recently become visible, weaving through the air like golden threads"). However, the piece recycles syntactic stems—"She saw," "She spent," "She would," "She realized"—across a dozen beats, creating template cadence. Phrases like "burnished sorrow" and "poetically inclined mind" repeat without variation, and the final sequence summarizes key turns ("compiled her findings," "presented her work") rather than dramatizing them, flattening momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.1)
    Template cadence pervades: nine consecutive paragraphs open with "Elian," "He," or "The" + noun, creating monotonous rhythm. Paraphrase loops appear ("tinkersong wonder" recurs four times; "mending what isn't torn" three times without reweighting). Stock metaphors ("stained with oil and starlight," "washed over") and summary beats ("he felt," "he knew") dull immediacy. Filter-verb stacks cluster in high-pressure moments ("He felt the covenant," "He knew he had to act"), reducing sentence-level propulsion. Applying −1.0 for template cadence and loops, and −0.4 for filter stacks touching peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically controlled. However, "hinged awakenings" appears four times with minimal variation, and "resonant hush" three times, creating a paraphrase loop that dulls momentum. The phrase "where explanations failed" recurs verbatim in three paragraphs. Figurative language is dense throughout (obsidian reflections, stone icicles, petrichor as presence) without pattern-teaching, verging on overwriting in the final beats. Minor template cadence: "She knelt... She held... She had spent... She left..." in the penultimate paragraph. Line-level clarity is good; no grammar errors.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade. "Perpetually learning" appears identically in three separate paragraphs. The phrase "turbine-hum reverie" recurs without variation. Figurative density clusters without causal work: "nebula of captured moments," "grains in her driftwood," "chain of makers," "anchor and sail" stack in quick succession. The final third summarizes rather than dramatizes: "Her own spirit felt woven into that timeless chain" tells the integration the carving should show. Synonym churn: "reimagine" × 2, "layered meanings" × 2, "scaffold" × 2 within tight spans.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but several text-pattern issues accumulate. Paraphrase loops appear: "reckoned with the silence" / "reckoning with light itself" / "Elara reckoned that her journey"; "dawning hush" appears three times with minimal reweighting. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens multiple consecutive sentences in several paragraphs. Stock metaphors cluster: "sharp as a blade," "heart light," "whispered secrets." Filter-verb stack in the cathedral scene ("began to see," "felt a surge," "noticed") dulls immediacy. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the closure image, reducing propulsion. Artifacts do not obscure causality but create cumulative drag (baseline −0.8 for loops/templates, −0.3 for stock phrases = −1.1 total).

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops appear: the diary is "encrypted" and "its lock intricate and unyielding" restate the same obstacle; "searing reverie" appears three times without evolving meaning. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "She [verb]." Stock phrases include "weight of history," "hidden beneath the towering dunes," "raw and unvarnished." The final six paragraphs loop thematically, restating Elara's burden and mission without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "rejected false comfort" appears three times across paragraphs; "through working memory" recurs as a template anchor four times with identical function. Synonym churn is visible in "conceive/conceived" (five instances) and "reimagine/reimagined" (four instances). Stock metaphors ("skeleton of paper and dust," "beacon of what could be achieved") and therapy-speak interiority ("solidified," "clarity of purpose") flatten the prose. Sentence stems repeat: "He [verb]" opens eight consecutive beats in the middle third. Apply −1.2 cumulative for loops, templates, and stock phrases; final third contains artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is adequate. However, template cadence appears in the middle section: "He remembered...He thought back...He realized...He vowed" stacks filter-like stems without propulsive variation (−0.4). Paraphrase loop near the end: "carrying the weight" / "velvet disquiet followed him like a shadow" restates similar affect without added pressure (−0.2). The phrase "emotional patterns" recurs five times without reweighting, bordering on thematic echo. No major clarity breaks, but momentum drags slightly in the final third due to summary layering.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "wild serenity" / "furious tranquility" / "furiously tranquil" recur without added meaning; "vortex inheritance" / "inherited power" / "vortex's energy" cycle across adjacent lines. Template cadence: "She had prepared… She placed… She focused… She had succeeded…" runs through the second half without variation. Figurative language is stacked ("smooth, cool silk overlaying rough, urgent stone") but mixed and abstract. Repeated sentence stems ("The atrium's…," "The egg…," "The oak acorn cap…") create drumbeat monotony. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("furiously tranquil" in the final paragraph), triggering the −1.7 and 9+ global disallowance per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe template-cadence and paraphrase-loop issues. The phrase "after the glue dried" appears three times (early setup, mid-story, final paragraph), and "zero hour" recurs six times with minimal variation. Runs of "Her [noun] was [adjective]" and "She [verbed]" across adjacent sentences create drumbeat rhythm. Lines 12–14 loop the siren/bell contrast without advancing pressure. "Credibly curious" (lines 3, 24, 38) and "solstice hush" (lines 2, 25, 35) read as ornamental tags. Baseline −1.2 for pervasive loops and template cadence; −0.3 additional for prompt-phrase repetition touching closure ("After the glue dried, everything held together"). Disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.7)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "He swept... he watched... he felt... he discovered... he realized... he placed... he sought... he listened... he understood... he stood... he held... he returned." Adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure ("vulnerability was not weakness, but a doorway" / "he sought to find strength in vulnerability"). Stock metaphors ("canvas of raw beauty," "messengers of change") and the phrase "primal elegance" appears three times without reweighting. Filter-verb stacks ("he felt," "he saw," "he learned") dull immediacy across the piece. Information density is low; many beats could be cut without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "unspoken words" appears six times; "tangled covenant" four times; "mute eloquence" three times, often in adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence: "Through contextual clues…" recurs identically in paragraphs 7, 19, and 40, a clear run triggering −0.6. The final third contains scaffold phrasing ("The timeframe after ghosts became visible had passed," "He was no longer just astonished; he was part of…"), lowering clarity and flattening the closure image. Combined artifact penalties: −1.2 in Q7, and the final-third touch disallows 9+ globally, capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "anticipated mysteries" recurs five times without variation; "texture of time" appears four times as synonym churn. Template cadence: "She rediscovered... She began... She would write..." in adjacent beats. The ending stacks summary clauses: "They held... The garage sale descriptions evolved... Elara realized..." without scene grounding. Filter-verb stacks in peak beats ("she felt a shift," "she perceived time") dull immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the maximum −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and rhythm varies. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "tend to his thoughts" / "began to tend to the moment" / "always tending"; "harmonizing discord" recurs without added meaning. The phrase "woven dawns" is repeatedly glossed in slightly different abstractions across paragraphs. Template cadence runs in the final third: "he had discovered… he felt… he thought… he smiled… he continued." These artifacts dull momentum and accumulate to moderate line-level debt, capping high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear and moves forward, but several template-cadence runs appear: "She would remodel…she would reshape…" and multiple "The [noun] was not [X], but [Y]" constructions ("not as a death sentence, but as a definitive deadline," "not built but grown," "not a cage of confinement, but a lattice"). Paraphrase loop in the second half: resonance/harmony/understanding/respect cycle without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "tapestry of connection." Information density is adequate but scaffolding ("Her motivation, long simmering, now crystallized") slows the opening. Template cadence across three+ sentences triggers −0.5; stock strings add −0.3; total artifact penalty −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Her destination was a rainwashed tower" / "the rainwashed tower stood before her"; "bronze quiet prevailed" / "the bronze quiet deepened" / "the bronze quiet returned." Template cadence in several paragraphs: "She saw… another… and others…" followed by "She pushed… She approached… Then she waited." These loops and stems dull momentum in the tower sequence, the story's closure zone, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "He knelt… He began to speak… He crushed… He scattered" across a dozen beats. "Submerged concord" and "narrow vastness" are repeated as incantations without evolving meaning, and phrases like "fertilize the earth" and "after the reef dies" recur without added pressure. Figurative language is dense but static—"thin finger of stone," "battlefield was being erased, blade by blade"—without pattern-teaching or payoff. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same action or theme. Penalize −0.8 for loops and template runs, −0.4 for stock metaphor strings in peak beats, totaling −1.2.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, though several phrases loop conceptually: "wild hush" appears six times, "distance into closeness" recurs without functional variation, and the leaf's "veins" metaphor is restated adjacently ("map he could no longer read" / "intricate veins superimposed"). Template cadence in the final paragraph: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "He [verb]," flattening propulsion. Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching, risking overwriting in accumulative mode. Clarity and grammar are clean; no major artifacts touch closure, but the repetitive stems and metaphor stacking warrant mid-band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from pervasive recycling of "temporally stretched," "echoed silence," and variations on "compass rose" without functional pressure shifts. Paraphrase loops appear: "The echoed silence was no longer empty; it was filled with the potential" restates prior content. Template cadence runs through the final third ("He was…," "His motivation…," "The gilded compass rose…"). Figurative language occasionally muddles (time "warping perception" vs. "temporally stretched air seeming to thin"). These artifacts cluster in non-closure beats but dull momentum, triggering a baseline penalty of approximately −0.8 in this category and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and maintains momentum, with varied sentence structures and clean grammar. However, several lines rely on abstract intensifiers without concrete grounding: "profound connection," "vast, mending tapestry," "sacred playfulness surfaced." The phrase "cautious abandon" appears twice, once in dialogue and once in narration, as a thematic echo rather than purposeful iteration. Minor template cadence appears in the ritual sequence ("He produced... The guardian held out... Their hands met"), but it does not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts touch the closure, keeping the score in the solid mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template cadence pervades: "She + verb" and "The [noun] + verb" stems repeat across nearly every paragraph without variation. Paraphrase loops appear ("to unbind the stories trapped in silence" / "She had unbound the stories"), and synonym churn cycles through "spelled," "tracing," "pattern" without adding pressure. Figurative language ("luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra") recurs in most beats without reweighting, creating density without propulsion. The final third stacks abstract claims ("embracing this luminous absence," "woven into the very fabric," "promise of a history written in gestures") that summarize rather than advance. Apply patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.2 for template cadence + loops + figurative muddle across closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "substitutes reality" / "substituted realities," "buried talents" / "talents, once buried," "seeded" / "seed" / "seeding" across adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate the second half (e.g., "She [verb]… The [noun] [verb]… Her [noun] [verb]…"). Stock metaphors ("flowers in cracked stone," "threads in the larger tapestry") appear in high-pressure beats without fresh angle. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("essence of her visions," "map of recovery") that clashes with the tactile opening. Applying patterned-artifact pack: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.5, stock metaphor strings −0.4 = baseline −1.5 in Q7. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("shape of her truth"), adding −0.2 for a total of approximately −1.7, which disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is clear, but several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "The woven hush of the village allowed no distraction" / "The woven hush now felt like a blanket of peace"; "His fingers, accustomed to the weight of ivory pieces, now fidgeted productively" / "his productive fidgeting resumed" / "His fingers, fidgeting, plucked." Elevated abstractions ("strategic blindness," "tempest of regret") recur without fresh embodiment. The final paragraph summarizes the arc ("he forgave himself," "his redemption") rather than trusting image. Apply paraphrase-loop −0.2, template-cadence −0.4, and summary closure −0.3 for a combined −0.9 in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is mostly clear and propulsive, with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, template cadence appears in repeated "The [X]" openings and paraphrase loops (e.g., "the echoes refracted it" appears in three consecutive beats with minor variation). Stock metaphors ("heavy stone," "glittering fragment") and a mild synonym churn around "refract/refracted" dull peak moments. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the closure image, applying −0.6 for loops and −0.3 for scaffold in the ending third.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "the world's memories were fraying into nothingness" / "the shattered recollections of a dying age" / "fragments into a coherent tapestry" all restate the same premise within the opening third. Template cadence runs dominate—"He believed… He must… His method… Elian prepared… He secured… Stepping onto…"—with identical subject-verb stems across six consecutive beats. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh angle: "edge of oblivion," "dire enchantment," "golden threads of meaning." Filter-verb stack in the climax: "felt the memories," "knew failure meant," "began to crumble." These artifacts flatten momentum and dull the closure image, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. Two minor scaffold artifacts: "This was the shell she had painted as a girl, leaving it here as a vow" restates discovery content within the same beat, and the final paragraph's summary mode ("she would paint again…the most rewarding") recaps rather than trusts the image. Figurative language ("salt-stung present," "cage of nostalgia") is functional but occasionally stacked in descriptive passages. Propulsion is strong until the closing reflection slightly diffuses momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and several lines do double duty (e.g., "The cork in her hand cooled, its work done" closes the ritual and the object arc). However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops: "whispers travel farther than shouts" / "quietest sounds carry the farthest" / "some truths are best whispered, not shouted" recycle the thesis across multiple beats without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the ritual sequence ("She imagined… She did not cry out… They traveled…") and stock metaphor ("waves erase footprints," "beacon of hope") dulls specificity. Mixed metaphor: "screaming tenderness" and "silent sound" want to be oxymorons but lack coherent vehicle logic.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and paragraphs breathe, but template cadence appears in runs: "The [noun] was [state]" and "She [verb], her [noun] a [metaphor]" recur across multiple beats. Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "reverse migration" and "geography of loss" are restated without added pressure. Metaphor density is high ("geography of loss," "landscape of grief," "charted map," "terra incognita") and some vehicles contradict (geography vs. landscape as distinct frames for the same concept). No filter-verb stacks or major clarity breaks, but figurative language in most sentences without clear payoff at closure triggers minor overwriting penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.8)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "involuntarily truthful" / "compulsion to speak only truth" / "involuntary words"; "smuggled" appears three times in identical construction; "fractured" recurs five times across "fractured state," "fractured grace" (twice), "fractured the world," "fractured grace" again. Template cadence in the final third: "The antique glass eye..." / "Elara, the rational..." / "The hanging orchard..." sentences stack identical subject-verb openings. Synonym churn: "occlude" / "occlusion" / "occlude" across three paragraphs. These artifacts cluster in the closure third, triggering the Q7 artifact cap and global 9+ disqualification. Information density is moderate; many sentences restate world premise rather than advance scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled with good variety in sentence length. However, multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "The borrowed memories..." recurs four times; "softly persistent" is repeated; "He remembered," "He realized," "He decided" form a pattern of declarative summaries. Figurative language ("mist...blurred the line," "prison of mist," "seam...a pearl") is vivid but dense in opening and closing paragraphs without pattern-teaching. Scaffold phrasing such as "This process felt like," "This decoding felt like" stacks up. Filter verbs ("felt like," "seemed") cluster without voice motivation. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence, −0.4 for filter-verb stacks in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and strong opening anchor ("lonely antique map dealer"). Information density is high in the mid-section (ants, fissure, cavern discovery), but the final paragraph introduces multiple near-paraphrases: "no longer lonely but resolved," "carrying the weight… not as a burden, but as a part of himself," "led him home, not to a place, but to a peace." These parallel constructions create rhetorical cadence but dull propulsion at the closure beat. Minor filter-verb reliance ("he felt closer," "he knew this was the moment") in peak moments. The matrix chip's mechanics are vividly handled mid-story, but the ending summarizes transformation rather than showing it through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence variety is present and the prose avoids major grammatical errors, but repetitive phrasing and scaffold artifacts accumulate: "softly commanding" appears three times, "bleeding starlight" recurs without evolving pressure, and the final paragraph loops synonym variations ("disenchanted ruler" / "softly commanding strength" / "lacy menace"). The phrase "lacy menace" in particular mixes metaphor vehicles (delicate fabric with threat) in a way that dilutes clarity. Information density is moderate; several lines restate prior content ("the mystery of her dreams unraveled" immediately followed by "she was not just a queen, but a vessel").

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "revalue the nexus...revalue herself," "capture the density of presence...density of presence was captured," "by returning differently...method by returning differently was complete." Template cadence runs in the middle third: "She looked...She lifted...She channeled...She focused...She felt." Stock metaphors (heart swelling, bond strengthening, path forward) appear without fresh vehicle. The final paragraph stacks summary statements that tell closure rather than dramatize it. Information density is low—most sentences do one job and many rephrase prior claims.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines do two jobs (advance plot and deepen interiority). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Grammar and punctuation are clean. However, several scaffold patterns emerge: "I [verb]" sentence stems in the opening third (six instances in close succession), and "The [noun] [verb]" constructions recur (cabin walls leaned in, air shifted, wind a cold slap). Figurative language clusters in the middle third without clear pattern-teaching, creating minor density drag. The final paragraph is propulsive and clear. Apply baseline artifact deduction for template cadence in the opening and mid-section runs; escalate slightly because the pattern touches multiple beats but not the closure image itself.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops: "She [verb]" scaffolding runs across six consecutive beats in the final third. Stock metaphors ("fog clung like a silent prayer," "cave of ticking shadows") and synonym churn ("hush," "trembling calm," "stillness") appear in most high-pressure sentences. Mixed metaphor: fog as prayer, then muffling agent. Closure beat ("She knew that healing often bloomed...") is summary platitude, not image.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence are pervasive: "She needed to shed," "She began to inscribe," "She spoke aloud," "She had used," "She stood" create a drumbeat of identical stems across the piece. Figurative language is dense ("crystallized," "saturated hush," "gem-like formations," "beacon," "cocoon") but often mixed or redundant, dulling momentum. Information density is low; many sentences restate transformation abstractly rather than advancing action. These artifacts touch the closure beats ("She exhaled, releasing… crystallized doubts"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence rhythm and strong imagery ("translucent figure with hands that moved as if conducting an unseen orchestra"). However, several scaffold or template-cadence artifacts appear: "Her method of exorcism involved…She believed these currents could…She aimed to reconnect" runs through expository stems without variation. The phrase "a perfect, painful thing" and "a profound hush" / "profound sorrow" repeat "profound" within close proximity. "The sound of chainsaws started up" uses passive construction where active voice would sharpen. Information density is high overall, but the middle section slows with background explanation that could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn dominate: "unravel/dissolve/unveil," "journeying inward/walking out" repeated across a dozen paragraphs without added pressure or detail. Template cadence pervades ("He [verb]. He [verb].") across three or more consecutive sentences in multiple passages. Stock metaphors ("mist under a rising sun," "beacon against shadows") appear without transformation. Filter-verb stacks ("he felt," "he knew," "he sought") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Artifacts touch the closure image ("reality stood pure and bright"), triggering the −1.7 deduction and global 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "after blowing the whistle" opens three paragraphs; "eminently peculiar" appears thrice in identical phrasing; "razor edges" and "counting backwards" recur as template stems without cumulative pressure. Figurative density in the final third ("razor edges of doubt," "friction of existence against the infinite," "fluid reality") stacks metaphors without coherent vehicle, triggering the overwriting and register-drift penalties. Information density is low—many lines restate the shepherd's quest rather than advancing it. The artifacts touch closure, applying the stated cap on high-band entries.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "lucid contradictions" appears six times, "clover melancholy" five times, "rainwashed" three times, often in adjacent or nearby sentences without added meaning. Template cadence dominates the final third: "She [verb], [noun]" and "The [noun] [verb], a [noun] of [abstraction]" recur mechanically. Line 18 ("His rebellion was not against math, but against its sobering truths") and line 28 ("For in the end, to be theoretically rebellious is to challenge not just theories, but the way we live them") restate theme without propulsion. Figurative language stacks without coherence: "clover melancholy of renewal and decay" mixes botanical with emotional register unconvincingly. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (coiled serpent, haunted melody, spinning disc) remains coherent without mixed metaphors. However, the piece contains paraphrase loops: "through wrong number friendships, he offered not solutions, but reflection" is restated multiple times across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the final third: "He had once been like Elara... Now, as operator, he passed on that gift... The streetlamps above would soon hum... And Leo, the underground phone booth operator, prepared to begin again." Stock metaphors ("the seed of a beginning," "a bridge between her past and her future") and abstract phrasing ("melodically haunted," "cultivated estrangement") accumulate without concrete anchors. The ending scaffolds rather than propels, and the phrase "teach endings how to begin" recurs without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive text artifacts harm momentum: paraphrase loops ("The jetty was saved...from being forgotten" / "The story was saved"), template cadence ("She felt...She knew...She was"), synonym churn for the same concept across adjacent paragraphs ("covenant," "promise," "regenerated covenant"), and stock metaphors ("threads holding the covenant together," "beacon in the dark"). The final third repeats "haunted euphoria" three times and recycles "gently thorough," "proximate causes," and "weight of small moments" as scaffold. Register drift into prompt-label language ("proximate causes," "context changes") clashes with the narrative voice. Minimal information density: many sentences restate prior claims without advancing action or internal shift. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack for loops, template runs, and filter stacks touching multiple beats and the final paragraph: baseline −1.2 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with vivid images ("silence and vines conspired," "leaf-choked hall," "fabric of polite anarchy"). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "The method...was spread through improbable rumor chains" is immediately restated as "People spoke of a woman...a tale that grew more fantastical"; "token...physical manifestation" recycles the same idea. The final paragraph stacks summary sentences with identical stems ("She remained...her desperately jocular facade..."). Template cadence and mild figurative density ("punctured his own shield," "living heart") appear in peak beats without cost. Apply −0.6 for loops and stem repetition touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity and rhythm are mostly controlled, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and elevated diction that repeats concepts without adding pressure. "The dowsing was a pull in her blood, a magnetic yearning guided by the platinum band" near-duplicates the ring's function already shown. "Quiet blaze" appears twice in identical phrasing. "Vast, unmapped sea" and "uncharted emotional depths" recycle the navigation metaphor without fresh detail. Stock phrases ("ghostly understanding," "psychic dew," "smoldering intensity") and filter-verb stacks in the second paragraph ("perceived," "felt," "understood," "knew") dull immediacy. Template cadence in paragraph three: "She reached out… It did not overwhelm her; it clarified her purpose. The platinum ring grew warm… The trail of notes descended…" runs identical stems across four beats. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase/loop and template issues, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor strings in peak beats (total −1.1), landing mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    Clarity and momentum are strong; sentence openings vary, and information density is high. Two paraphrase loops lower the score: "She was meticulously revising... to frame it" followed immediately by "She sought to unbend the narrative, to straighten the crooked story" restates the same action without added pressure (−0.2). "Confidently uncertain" and "strange comfort" recur as stock phrasings without fresh embodiment. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The final image ("forever listening") is clean and propulsive, but the mid-story scaffold reduces line-level excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.5)
    Clarity is high; no pronoun confusion or timeline breaks. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm supports the lyric mode. However, figurative language saturates nearly every paragraph without rest ("vessel of perception," "symphony woven within," "silent chord"), creating density that slows momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 10–11 restate the advisor's method ("mapping silence," "translate… into a tapestry of music") without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("He showed," "He continued," "He passed") and therapy-speak phrases ("joyful sorrow," "weight of silence") dull immediacy in peak beats, triggering artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose carries significant template artifacts: repeated "He [verb]" stems across paragraphs, paraphrase loops ("rescue"/"rescued" echoed without added pressure), and stock metaphors ("abyss of forgetfulness," "shadows"). The phrase "volcanic tenderness" appears three times with identical phrasing, functioning as thematic label rather than evolving image. Information density is low; several beats restate Kaelen's mission without advancing causality. Line-level propulsion stalls during reflective blocks that summarize rather than dramatize key turns (the days of documentation, the mending of the tapestry).

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "She had not fully realized the dream, but she had given it a vital breath" and "The shared dream was not extinguished; it lay dormant, awaiting another breath" restate the same content across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence runs ("Elara was… She found… Each evening she perched… Quietly rebellious, she resisted…") and synonym churn ("quiet rebellion," "quietly rebellious," "her quiet defiance") appear throughout, with density spiking in the final third where every paragraph begins with a summary assertion. Stock metaphors ("beacon for other lost souls," "tapestry," "testament to her spirit") and filter-verb stacks ("She felt," "She knew," "She smiled") dull propulsion at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are mostly distinct. Minor loops: "her movements deliberate yet fluid" / "calculated spontaneity" echo the same idea across beats. Stock phrasing appears: "Instead of arguing, Elara smiled" (boilerplate beat opener), "his eyes widened," "understanding dawning." The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing closure: "she had proven" tells outcome instead of showing cost. One paraphrase loop: "Her motivation was simple yet profound" restates the whisper-vs.-shout premise immediately after establishing it. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (storm scrambles tech, forcing map use) but others scaffold without advancing (e.g., "Intrigued, Kael fell into step"). No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, limiting deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "spiralingly calm" / "stillwater tension" / "profound, spiraling calm" recycle the same abstract concept; "silent empathy" / "silent language" / "silent, empathetic play" repeat without added detail. Template cadence runs across multiple beats: "Her work existed… Her motivation was clear… Her silent empathy flowed… She adjusted… She knew…" Stock metaphors cluster in the final third: "weave hope into the fabric of the secret," "theater for this silent, empathetic play," "learned to cherish the stars." The dental mirror "became her conduit, reflecting not just light, but understanding" blurs vehicle and tenor. Figurative density in the closure paragraphs—"woven hope," "living truth," "testament to the calm"—obscures concrete action. Apply −1.4 for patterned artifacts touching closure; disallow 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.6)
    Heavy paraphrase loops pervade: "unspoken words" appears seven times, "amplified quiet" four times, "forests of second thoughts" three times, creating synonym churn without added pressure. Template cadence runs through multiple paragraphs ("She could hear… She moved… She entered… She reached… She held"). Stock metaphors ("protective shroud," "tapestry of unease") and filter-verb stacks ("could hear," "seemed to seep," "began to sprout") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch multiple beats, triggering cumulative deductions (−1.4) and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening. However, several lines edge toward overwriting: "a vibration that resonated in the marrow of her bones," "a wave of combative tenderness washed over her," and the repeated "guarded heart" framing. The phrase "the world she left behind seemed to fade into a distant memory" is generic summary in a pivotal beat. No major loops or artifacts, but the figurative language clusters in key moments without always adding causal pressure. Clarity and propulsion remain strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "blank-faced performer" / "blank face" appears four times; "morally ambiguous" / "moral grayness" / "moral ambiguity" recurs five times; "remade hush" is stated three times identically. Adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure: "her expression a permanent, placid mask" followed two paragraphs later by "her blank face a shield" and later "Elara's blank face remained unchanged." Template cadence runs through the piece: "She [verb]. She [verb]. She [verb]." Figurative language in nearly every sentence ("skeleton of color," "map of loss," "chasm where grief had been remade") without pattern-teaching or payoff creates density without propulsion. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("figure of moral ambiguity"), triggering −1.7 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "dissolving boundaries" / "boundaries dissolved" / "boundaries around him began to blur and fade" / "dissolving another layer of separation" across multiple paragraphs restate the same idea without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear: "He placed… He began… He stepped… He was… He continued… He walked… He reached… He composed…" in sequential paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("tremor of certainty," "lantern-moth hush") recur without fresh inflection. Register is elevated and consistent but line-level density is low—many sentences perform one job where two would fit. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: baseline −0.8 for loops and template stems; total deduction pushes score into mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences flatten momentum: "He often thought of Maestra" / "Elian knew that his bartered awakening" / "The memory...stayed with him" recycle the same retrospective summary structure across the final third. Figurative language clusters without variation: "unique splendor," "emotional depth," "exquisite in the incomplete" stack abstract high-register terms in quick succession, creating density without information gain. The opening paragraph contains a simultaneity error ("its ascent leaving the sky ablaze" while Elian observes, though he is colorblind). Several beats tell rather than show: "his motivation was to find beauty in imperfection" and "each one a tribute to finding beauty in imperfection" summarize instead of dramatizing. These artifacts touch the closure beats (final five paragraphs), triggering the escalated penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.2)
    Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines are pervasive: "texture of connection" recurs without added detail; "golden shadows" appears five times with identical framing. Template cadence runs dominate ("each chime...each analysis," "not just discovering...but actively weaving"). Stock metaphors ("phantom in the golden shadows," "tapestry of interwoven vibrations") cluster in the closure sequence, reducing specificity when precision is most needed. The line "The world outside had settled into a steady hum, but here..." buries the transition mid-sentence. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5, stock metaphor strings in closure −0.6; total artifact penalty −1.5, touching closure, caps high-band entries at 8.7 and disallows 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and templated phrasing. Adjacent sentences restate the same content without added pressure: "She realized he had left this trail... a method to teach her how to make withering bloom again" echoes the motivation already established. Template cadence runs dominate: "Each piece a monument to loss... each piece an illumination... each origami figure she folded... And the curtains... And so... And Elara." Stock metaphor strings ("rock bottom," "steady star," "seed for new growth") accumulate without fresh specificity. The phrase "genuinely artificial" is repeated four times across four beats without reweighting, and "subdued ardor" appears three times as a label rather than embodied state. High-pressure beats lean on filter-verb stacks ("she saw," "she learned," "she continued") that dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("her subdued ardor... now burned like a steady star"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "reverse engineering" appears three times in near-identical constructions; "by multiplying paths" is repeated mechanically across four paragraphs without variation. Template cadence dominates—"Her motivation... was a compulsion"; "The measuring tape... was not for physical dimensions"—stacking identical stems. Stock metaphors ("drink the dim light," "whispered secrets") and synonym churn ("probing, always questioning") flatten momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("woven a new narrative from the threads"), triggering −1.7 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.6)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence ("She felt," "The atoms," "Elara [verb]") across adjacent lines create scaffold drag. Key beats are summarized ("Purification required her to separate the pain from the pleasure") rather than shown through concrete action. Stock metaphors ("whisper from lost ages," "weight of centuries") and near-synonym churn ("anguished joy" appears three times) dull momentum. Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats reduce immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disqualifying 9+ globally and applying −1.4 within Q7 for spread and closure contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity is generally high, and rhythm varies purposefully. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "The comparison was stark; the vibrant colors had muted, and a creeping darkness moved at the edges" recaps what was just shown. The final paragraph stacks three abstract summary sentences ("knowing that some transformations come with the cost of forgetting what made them necessary. The dusk outside deepened... She had saved hope, but in its new, perfect shape, she wondered if it could still be called hope at all") that restate the same regret without added detail or pressure. Figurative language is dense but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Information density is moderate, with some scaffolding that could be trimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clean and purposeful, but several lines carry overwriting that blunts momentum. "Her conviction in the inherent goodness...felt as fragile as a bird's egg" stacks metaphor without sharp pressure; "the scalding need for self-respect" and "bitterness that threatened to curdle her compassion" layer figurative language in adjacent beats. The phrase "a quietly vivid thing" in the second paragraph introduces the prompt attribute awkwardly. Minor paraphrase loop: "shedding layers" is repeated across multiple paragraphs without varied phrasing. Rhythm is controlled, but density could be higher; some lines do only one job where two would tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do double duty (e.g., "frosted hourglass" anchors both miracle and stalled time). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("meteor hush," "leafy sigh," "root-lights of sympathetic flora") across high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching, and "the narrative woven into his flesh" is a stock phrase in the closure zone. These issues total roughly −0.5 in this category, preventing 8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is clear and free of major grammatical errors, but suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. The middle section recycles "She [verb]" stems across multiple consecutive sentences ("She saw," "She understood," "She closed," "She focused," "She reached," "She concentrated," "She saw"). Several beats restate the same content without added pressure (e.g., "The film strip was now just an object, its secret revealed" followed immediately by "But the unused love it held was now a part of her"). Information density is low; scaffolding sentences do not advance situation or character. Stock metaphors ("like a sleeping serpent," "hushed thunder") appear without fresh inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "She possessed… She relied… She retreated… Her method… Her motivation" in the opening; "The moonstruck dreamer had transformed… Yet shadowed rapture lingered… So she continued… She understood" near closure. Stock phrases ("forever cast upward," "cosmic essence," "bittersweet ecstasy") accumulate without fresh specificity. Figurative language is dense but often generic ("weaver of light and sound"). Applying −1.0 for loops and cadence artifacts; the closure beat itself is touched by summary phrasing, preventing higher recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "cultivate the sparks" / "tend to multiple sites" / "cultivating each spark with care" churn synonyms without added pressure. Template cadence in middle third: "She charmed it too… She focused on the method… She reached for one such spark" stacks identical stems across seven lines (−0.6). Figurative density ("needle through cloth," "labyrinth of light and shadow," "vessel for this work") in most sentences of closure beats without taught pattern (−0.5). Register drift into quantum-physics diction clashes with fantasy setting. Information density low; many lines restate without advancing. Artifacts touch closure beat: disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.3)
    Clarity is adequate; no causality breaks. Paraphrase loops appear: "disorienting journeys common" / "unpredictable translocation" restate the same idea, and "the hum of insight" recurs without escalation (−0.2). Template cadence runs in the middle third ("She paused… she held it up… she was on the right path") with adjacent action beats sharing identical stems (−0.4). Stock metaphors—"wild frontier," "ancient truths"—appear in the final beats without transformation (−0.3). Figurative language ("trees sighed," "forest breathed") is coherent but dense across most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, nearing the overwriting threshold. Cumulative artifact penalty −0.9, plus minor drag from recycled openers, totaling roughly −1.2 within band.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, paragraphs breathe, and figurative language (ridgeway as ribbon, pines as sentinels) remains coherent. Information density is moderate; some lines loop thematically without advancing situation ("the vigil was not just a watch, but an active waiting" closely echoes prior material). Minor template cadence in the opening third: "The air was cool... The guides never hurried her... After a time, the lead guide paused..." reads as stem repetition. No grammatical errors; clarity is high. The phrase "shoreline lullaby" recurs three times, twice as naked label without fresh contextual charge. Propulsion slows in the middle traverse section where description accumulates without tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence structures and concrete imagery. Information density is strong in the investigation sequence. Minor issues include template openings ("He knelt," "He sought," "He felt," "He walked") across multiple paragraphs and some synonym churn around "silence" and "cost." The phrase "a event" (missing article) is a proofreading slip. A few paraphrase loops restate the unpardonable silence concept without advancing pressure. No severe artifacts touch the closure, so deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly legible ("shelves curved like sleeping dragons," "ink blooming like a night flower"), but accumulation in every beat without pattern-teaching lowers momentum—applies −0.5. Mixed metaphor: "weight of epochs in his eyes" (temporal abstraction) sits uneasily with "diminutive titan" (physical paradox) without synthesis. Template cadence runs in the middle third: "His task was to sunder... His method was... His words were not..." (−0.4). Stock phrasing ("weight of authenticity," "graceful collapse") recurs without fresh embodiment. Paraphrase loop: "nothing false can hold against the tide of truth" echoes the closing "only what was true remained" without adding pressure (−0.2). Cumulative artifacts and elevated diction in peak beats (confrontation) dull immediacy, totaling approximately −1.1 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and most lines carry information density. The phrase "periodically eternal" recurs four times, functioning as motif but bordering on overwriting for a piece this length. Paraphrase loops appear: "drifting...unmoored" (para 6) and "drifting sensation...found its mooring" (final para); "delayed revelation" named twice in close succession. Filter-verb stacks in the final third ("felt a surge," "felt more grounded," "felt the weight," "felt truly home") reduce immediacy at closure. No major causality breaks, but scaffold reduces propulsion in the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean, with varied sentence openings and vivid sensory detail ("cool, dusty concrete," "low, persistent hum"). However, multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "awkwardly confident gait" / "awkward confidence came from knowing" / "awkwardly confident heart" cycles the label without adding pressure. Template cadence runs in the final third: "She felt... She smiled... She knew..." Stack of filter verbs in the climax ("she noticed," "she knew," "she felt") dulls immediacy. Register drift into abstract diction ("nexus of forgotten power," "coalesce from the mess") clashes with the barefoot physicality established earlier. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems, −0.3 for filter-verb stack in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound with good sensory anchoring ("warm mist," "mineral-scented passages"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "not as a dictate, but as a catalyst" / "not as prophecies to be feared, but as tools" repeat a template structure. The final paragraph stacks summary telling across multiple timeframes ("In the years that followed...And in the quiet moments") rather than landing in one charged present image. Template cadence appears in explanatory clauses: "a concept that resonated," "a task that felt tied," "a symbol of serendipitous discovery." Information density is moderate; many sentences do double work, but scaffolding phrases like "This was the object of her quest" announce rather than dramatize.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean. However, paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "somatic markers" is repeated four times, "pearl of stillness" three times, often in similar syntactic frames without fresh inflection. The final third stacks summary statements ("This was her anchored optimism," "she had built a sanctuary") that deflate momentum rather than propelling through image. Mixed metaphor: "seeded new life" in ruins jars against botanical specificity established earlier. Information density suffers in the closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and supports the meditative tone; figurative language ("kaleidoscope of half-remembered smiles," "luminescent ache") is dense but mostly coherent. However, multiple rhetorical questions and some abstract phrasing ("the very lens through which he viewed existence") veer toward overwriting in a high-concept beat without clear pattern-teaching. The paragraph beginning "Why do we hide…" risks addressing the reader rather than remaining anchored in Elian's crisis. Minor paraphrase loops ("untangling threads" recurs across several paragraphs without adding new detail each time). Information density is solid; the prose advances atmosphere and interiority consistently, though peak beats could tighten further. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong visual anchors and no major grammatical errors. However, several lines exhibit mild overwriting: "bruised purple," "cold, steady flame," "excruciating slow motion," "dreamlike lethargy" stack modifiers without sharp necessity. The phrase "consciously wild, a man who had tamed the feral parts of himself" reads as scaffold explanation rather than dramatized trait. No template loops or paraphrase cycles are present, but density could tighten in the middle section where observation narration slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm is generally clean. Information density is adequate, with most lines advancing situation or atmosphere. However, the piece exhibits paraphrase loops: "dizzying quiet" appears four times, "contraband truths" recurs mechanically, and synonym churn ("hush," "silence," "still," "quiet") stacks without fresh charge. The final third repeats the closure claim across multiple sentences ("new chapter began," "work done," "conscience clear," "fire in the frozen dark," "promise of dawn"), diluting propulsion. Template cadence in reflective summary (e.g., "She was no longer…she was…") and stock metaphor ("seed of truth," "fire in the frozen dark") trigger cumulative penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "inculcating plants with values" appears six times with minor synonym variation (inculcate, inculcated, inculcating) but no added pressure. Template cadence runs across multiple sentences: "She was...," "She remembered...," "She spent...," "She explained..." Stock metaphors ("tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet") repeat without evolving meaning. The final paragraph stacks summary claims ("the legacy would endure," "continuity was woven," "would never fade") that restate the premise rather than advance it. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "began to") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates appropriately. However, paraphrase loops appear: "voicing silence" is explained three times without new information; "zigzag" recurs descriptively across multiple beats without functional difference. Stock metaphors ("ribbon of sound," "beacon") and elevated diction ("profound peace," "legacy") cluster in the closure sequence, dulling specificity. Template cadence: "He [verb]… He [verb]…" runs appear in the middle third. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for stock metaphor strings in peak beats (total −0.9 within Q7).

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clear with strong imagery (rosewood nib worn smooth, filing cabinets as sentinels, clouds parting). Information density is high in the archive beat where each file advances discovery. However, several loops and scaffolds: "Her motivation, sharp as a shard of glass, was to discover hidden truths" paraphrases the prior sentence's trait description; "orbits of regret" is explained twice (grandfather/father cycles, then "tightened their grip"); "solemn playfulness" appears as identical phrase in two paragraphs without variation. The line "a fusion of old and new" over-explains the nib-into-stylus image. Template cadence in "She would [verb]" constructions (three instances) adds −0.4. No severe artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at −0.8 total.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "hush the dissonance" / "hushed the dissonance"; "guilt washing over her" / "weight lift"; "tether the frayed threads" / "tethered the lost sounds." Template cadence runs dominate (e.g., four consecutive "She [verb]" openers mid-story). Filter-verb stacks ("she could translate," "she decided," "she resolved") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Mixed metaphors (time "folds," guilt "bleeds," frequency "merges") muddle the closure image. Apply −1.2 for loops/templates and −0.4 for figurative incoherence, totaling −1.6 in Q7; artifacts touch closure, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The mess was not something to be cleaned, but to be embraced" immediately follows the mandala's lesson about "beautiful, chaotic connections," restating without added pressure. Synonym churn around "hush" (murmur/whisper/quiet/stillness) flattens rhythm. Template cadence in the final third: "The man who had spoken… / The woman who had called… / Elara smiled… / The whispering gallery tile flake…" uses parallel stems across four consecutive beats. The closure paragraph also stacks filter verbs ("seemed," "felt," "knew") that dull immediacy when decisive action is expected.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "The visions did not vanish, but their hold loosened, becoming echoes rather than shackles" restates the same idea twice without adding pressure. Template cadence runs in the final paragraph: "The warm coldness… persisted… To cradle empathy… Elara—now Aeliana—walked… each step…" with repetitive "the" + noun openings. Figurative language is dense but mixed: "hooks of past moments" and "prisons of sensation" overlap metaphorically; "cradling empathy in arms of steel" is repeated across multiple beats without evolution. Stock phrases ("beneath a shattered sky," "the hollow air") and elevated register ("aberrant mercy," "living paradox") appear in peak beats without POV grounding. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate the retrocognitive trap and empathy-armor motif without new detail. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops −0.3, template cadence −0.4, stock metaphor strings −0.3, total baseline −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.4)
    Density is moderate; many lines do double duty (e.g., "silver apples, their scent evoking greasepaint"). Paraphrase loops appear: "her motivation was pure and desperate" / "to lure possibility from the brink of despair" / "transform her stagnant eternity into something new" restates the same content across three sentences. Template cadence runs in the final third: "She began to sing... The fractured timeline resisted... She intertwined the moments... Each echo strengthened... The garden itself responded." Stock metaphors ("thread of silver light," "cascade of emotion") cluster in peak beats without fresh specificity. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clarity and propulsion are mostly sound, but several lines loop concept without adding pressure: "Through somatic markers, he traced each memory" immediately follows the decision to "use somatic markers," and "fractally precise" recurs as descriptor without evolving function. The phrase "illuminate hidden pathways" appears in both motivation statement and closure, reducing resonance. Template cadence in the middle third: multiple "He [verb]" and "Each [noun]" openers within three paragraphs. The final third avoids major artifacts, limiting damage, but the loops and stems accumulate to −0.6 under the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "I discovered the elm leaf fossil...This fossil is not just a relic; it is a catalyst"; "factually mystical" appears three times without reweighting; "heat-mapping" is repeated in adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("I knew then...I continued...What emerged..."). Stock metaphors ("symphony of heat signatures," "tapestry of transition") cluster without fresh specificity. Apply −1.2 for patterned artifacts including closure-beat repetition ("the world after humans hibernated was no longer silent; through me, it had found its voice").

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops dominate: "unscramble its meaning, to find the loose threads" / "unscrambling another piece of the prophetic code"; "shared wisdom" repeated without variation; "quietly inspired" echoed mechanically. Sentence stems recur: "She [verb]" opens five consecutive beats mid-story. Figurative language—"tangled knot," "branching rivers," "tapestry of interwoven fates"—stacks without adding pressure. The closing paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes, listing achievements instead of landing an image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is mostly clear with varied sentence openings and paragraph rhythm. Multiple artifacts lower momentum: "The burned spy felt the world's tilt toward spring" (passive filter stack), "prudently daring" (label without embodiment), and paraphrase loops ("fixing what was broken" / "fix what was broken" / "fixed what was broken" across three beats). Stock metaphors ("mist coiling like forgotten secrets," "silver hush") and template cadence in action beats ("He opened… His motivation sharpened… He began…") reduce density. Proximity to closure (final paragraph moralizing) triggers high-band disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "closely attentive," "ambient awareness," and "percolate" recur as template phrases without variation. Paragraph structure is monotonous; many sentences begin with "He" or "The." Stock metaphors—"river as time," "fog as veil"—cluster without fresh inflection. "Spindrift serenity" appears three times, always as decoration. The final two paragraphs contain synonym churn ("essence," "forgiveness," "new beginning") and scaffold-like recap. Information density is low; adjacent lines restate the same idea.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are generally distinct. However, paraphrase loops appear: "thrum was not a sound but a feeling, a pulse" restates in adjacent clauses. The final paragraph stacks summary: "its resistance to change no longer a mystery but a testament" and "kindness, like light, could anchor a soul" are conceptual redundancies that dull closure momentum. Figurative density is high ("sharp gentleness," "fractured timelines," "soft light spread, mending the fractures") but coherent. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt an instinctive pull," "sensed the core concept") slightly dulls immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence rhythm and selective sensory detail. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("quivering hush" recurs without added pressure; "instill" is repeated across beats without evolving meaning). Stock metaphors ("fragile cloak," "canvas for her quiet efforts") and elevated diction ("enduring purpose") drift from the POV's grounded ritual. Template cadence in expository interiority ("She was wistfully pragmatic... Her motivation... Tonight, she would...") slightly flattens momentum. Artifacts stay minor and do not obscure closure, but density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates adequately. However, repetitive phrasing pervades: "brittle awakening/awakenings" appears four times, "coexist/coexistence" five times, "isolation/isolated" six times, "independence/independent" five times, creating synonym loops that dull momentum. Template cadence is evident in the final third: "She had become…" "Her life was…" "And in the quiet…" Stock metaphors ("mist under a morning sun," "bridge connecting all times") reduce specificity. The loop/scaffold screen flags paraphrase across adjacent lines (e.g., paragraphs restating "coexistence" without added pressure). Apply −1.0 for pervasive loops and template stems that touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; no algorithmic stems. "Prismatic quiet" recurs (opening, ending) with purpose. Minor loops: "secrets she carried" / "keeper of secrets" restates across paragraphs without added detail (−0.2 paraphrase-loop). "Each strand she added was like a sentence in one of her letters" is template simile but isolated. Figurative language ("pale dream," "hum with a silent music," "invisible filament") appears in most sentences of reflective beats without pattern-teaching (−0.4 density). No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. Information density is moderate; several scaffold sentences ("This was where she would build") could compress. Clarity and grammar are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence variety and rhythm are adequate; the opening establishes voice and stakes efficiently, and the broadcast sequence (bypass protocols, input parameters, activate, thrumming, signal stutters) maintains propulsion without redundancy. However, several artifacts cluster in non-closure beats: "Static hissed... a white noise sea he was paid to navigate" mixes vehicle (sea/navigate) with the hiss in a way that strains coherence; "entities that fed on chaos and misunderstanding" is summary-tell where a concrete detail would sharpen; "wave of relief, tentative and fragile" is generic label-speak. The phrase "power play from the stars, a game where humanity was the unwitting pawn" in the setup and Evans's "final power play" near closure create a thematic loop without added pressure. Minor template cadence in the climax ("He activated... A deep thrumming filled... nothing changed... Then, the signal stuttered") is functional but not vivid. The closing two sentences ("The night settled... silent and watchful") are stock phrasing. No major loops or causality breaks, and information density is adequate, but line-level texture lacks the concrete, character-particular detail that would elevate craft.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "She had uncovered the vital key" / "The vital key was not just for the nexus"; "During the fallow period, when the land lay dormant" / "During the fallow period, she found..."; "wistful rebellion" appears five times in identical phrasing. Runs of "The [noun] [past-tense verb]" and "She [past-tense verb]" create drumbeat rhythm across dozens of lines. Figurative language ("spatial mutiny," "harmonic key to inner calm") mixes registers without coherent vehicle logic. Scaffolding like "And the echo...," "And as she looked...," "And so, with..." pads transitions rather than advancing pressure. Zero on-page action in the final dozen paragraphs—pure summary.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the quarry sequence (each line advances setting, character process, or thematic synthesis). Figurative language is purposeful: "mist clung to the granite walls like a shroud," "every shadow seemed to hold its breath." However, the final paragraph employs mild scaffold: "not a malicious act, but a terrible accident" and "not to a person's identity, but to a relationship" use parallel construction that edges toward template cadence. The phrase "awful clarity" in the penultimate sentence is a near-cliché. Minor loops appear: "methodical" recurs four times, and "opposites she needed to unify" is restated twice in adjacent paragraphs. These artifacts slightly dull momentum but do not obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "nervously confident" appears three times with synonym churn ("hands steady…tremor in her voice," "nervously confident determination," "voice nervously confident"). Template cadence runs through the middle third with repeated "she discovered," "she realized," "she felt" stems. The closing paragraph stacks filter verbs and abstractions—"felt a profound peace, the dread receding"—rather than grounding in concrete action or image. Figurative language mixes vehicles: "spongey dread" that "absorbs hope" clashes with dread that "morphs into frantic energy."

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.2)
    Repetitive phrasing pervades: "sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" appears three times verbatim; "luminous disbelief" and "pixelated amnesty" recur as unearned motifs rather than evolving images. Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third (e.g., the scaffold wrap explanation is restated across multiple sentences without added pressure). Stock metaphors ("awe that left him breathless," "boundaries of reality soften") flatten peak beats. Template cadence ("He was X, and now he Y") appears in closure paragraphs. Cumulative artifact debt (loops, stock imagery, template stems) totals approximately −1.4, and the final third is touched by these patterns, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high with no major loops or scaffolding. However, the final paragraph contains paraphrase redundancy: "saw now that the startup's rise and fall was just another loop" followed by "His motivation to discover why some paths circle back was answered." The phrase "polished calm" appears three times without evolving function, and "dusky harmony" is repeated identically in the opening and near-closure. Figurative language is dense but controlled; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor paraphrase loop in closure vicinity: −0.3 applied once.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "shared burdens" appears seven times, "healing with words" / "healed with words" five times, "variable stars" eight times, often in adjacent lines without added pressure or detail. Template cadence runs through the piece ("She felt," "She realized," "She witnessed," "She knew") across dozens of sentences. Stock metaphors ("warmth spread," "words flowing like a balm") and therapy-speak ("mending her insecurities," "ease the suffering") cluster in peak beats. Combined artifact penalty (−1.7) and disallowance of 9+ globally per the artifact cap rule.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "The vortex whirled… yet she moved" / "The vortex slowed, the cursed lake's heart calming" recycle the same image without added pressure (−0.4). Template cadence runs appear: "She began… She recalled… She sensed… She found… She felt" across five consecutive beats (−0.6). Mixed metaphor: "seeds… locked away like seeds in winter" contradicts "flesh-eating plant seeds" as threat without clarifying the distinction. Filter-verb stack in high-pressure beat: "She sensed… she would need… she pressed… willing it…" dulls immediacy (−0.5). Stock metaphor "heart beat in time with the expanding circles" is cliché without fresh vehicle. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("she vowed to never again let confessions freeze"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "anxious elation" appears three times; "eclipsed covenant" and "intersection of dreams" are repeated without evolving meaning. Template cadence runs in opening beats ("Here, after..." "She was..." "Her motivation...") flatten rhythm. Figurative language clusters densely without earned payoff: "threads of memory," "tapestry of countless possibilities," "bridges of light" feel stock rather than specific. Clarity holds but information density is low; many lines restate rather than advance. The closure image ("dissolved into starlight") is generic.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("boots whispering," "heart a mixture of shadow and determination," "cocoon of introspection"), and while some images are vivid, the accumulation in high-pressure beats (kneeling before the oak, keeper's challenge) slows momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "to patch holes in her soul" repeats in varied form three times (opening, midpoint, near-close). Template cadence: "She was a reckless idealist… She had come to trammel… She was trammeling…" employs parallel "She [verb]" stems across adjacent paragraphs. Synonym churn around "meaning" (inlaying, assigning, flowing) without added pressure. Artifacts cluster in the final third ("quiet healing," "dusky resolve softening into peace"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence openings. Minor loops: "He was insulating again, hiding behind technicalities" directly after showing the deflection in dialogue; "After the applause" repeats as a thematic anchor without adding new pressure. Stock metaphors: "hollow quiet," "shield," "anchor," "spiraling thoughts." The phrase "wrest control" and "wrest this new purpose" feel like template echoes of the required action verb rather than organic idiom. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he looked") cluster in the middle third but do not obscure causality. Information density is moderate; some beats (the research montage) summarize rather than dramatize.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear and grammatically clean, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences. Example cluster mid-story: "This analogy felt promising, a key to unlocking the mystery" immediately followed by "He recalled how the spirit had faded…a transition of essence rather than form" and then "His haunted ambitions whispered of past failures…but now he embraced his methodical nature, step by step"—three consecutive moves restating Elian's hopeful persistence without advancing situation or knowledge. Template cadence runs through the piece: "He [verb]" openers appear in seven consecutive sentences in the middle section. Stock metaphors (river merging into the sea, journey symbols bending like magnetic fields) and prompt-echo phrasing ("haunted ambitions," "kindly methodical," "touching distance") recur without fresh embodiment. Information density is low in the final third, where closure is narrated rather than dramatized: "his work complete," "transitions understood and embraced," "purpose and peace."

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean, with vivid figurative language ("seawater rhythms polished the stone floor"). However, the piece exhibits paraphrase loops: "Elian's motivation was to find magic in the mundane" and later "he found not monotony, but a deep, abiding wonder" restate the same concept. Template cadence appears in repeated "He [verb]" structures across beats. Sentence openings show variety, but information density is low—many lines restate Elian's serenity or the identities' fluctuations without advancing situation or choice. No major artifact obscures closure, yet the cumulative scaffolding and synonym churn ("wonder," "magic," "mystery," "grace") dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is generally high, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences. "The resonant hush deepened, now filled with a harmony" restates the opening's "resonant hush." "He felt compelled to pick it up" → "As he cradled it in his palm" is consecutive micro-movement narration without pressure. Stock metaphors ("beacon," "walls he had built around his own heart") appear in peak beats without fresh inflection. Register occasionally drifts into therapy-speak ("dissolve the walls between hearts," "become a conduit for abandoned hopes"). Sentence openings vary, but information density is moderate; many lines do one job where they could do two. The final paragraph over-explains rather than trusting the image to carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is mostly clear and propulsive. Opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "raw solace" appears three times with similar phrasing; "map references" as both geographical and emotional is restated; "patched with tape" recurs without evolving function. The phrase "daringly methodical" is introduced but never demonstrated through contradictory action on the page. Figurative language is frequent ("tomb of dusty benches," "sky bleeding with sunset," "tangled geography of regret") but mostly coherent. Sentence openings vary. One minor filter-verb cluster ("She remembered... She had not played... she had been blaming") in paragraph two, but not severe enough to trigger the stacked-filter penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy scaffold and synonym churn pervade: "cautious exuberance" appears four times, "propagation delays" eight times, "cyclically reversed" five times, "document/documented" six times—often in adjacent paragraphs without added meaning. Paraphrase loops cluster mid-story ("The mist thickened, pulsating" / "The mist parted, revealing"). Template cadence dominates with repetitive "She [verb]" openings across a dozen sentences. Figurative language is sparse and functional, but clarity suffers under keyword stacking that reads as prompt-fulfillment rather than organic narration. Information density is low; many sentences restate the challenge without advancing it. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("cyclically reversed but forever unfolding"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative language is dense and often mixed: "perforated destiny," "mulberry ache," "seeds bursting into flight on an unseen wind," "memory of cold and sound." Several phrases loop or paraphrase: "propagate their essence" / "propagation had begun" / "propagated seeds"; "the promise had held its glow just long enough" echoes earlier "before the promise...lost its glow." Template cadence appears in the final third ("The empire would never know... but the plants would remember. And in their whispers..."). These artifacts dull momentum and touch the closure beat, triggering escalated penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "lucidly watchful" appears three times across adjacent paragraphs; "threshold of stillness" is repeated without reweighting; "radiant hush" recurs as a static phrase. Template cadence appears in the final third ("She had succeeded… She carefully placed… Her role… She descended…"). Stock metaphors ("parched root absorbing rain," "fragment of immortality") and synonym churn ("infuse," "infusing," "infusion") dull momentum. Figurative density in non-peak beats ("suspended moment where time itself seemed to pause," "solemn triumph") reads as overwriting without pressure payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "cycle of rebirth" appears nine times, often in adjacent sentences restating the same idea without added detail. Template cadence runs dominate ("After forgiving… she felt," "As she worked… the hairpin," "With renewed clarity, she resolved"). Stock metaphors recur without fresh angle: "hollow ache," "mirror for her soul," "cocoon of peace." The final third intensifies these artifacts—"The antique hairpin… seemed to hum with approval" followed immediately by "a testament to the beauty found in continuous transformation"—dulling the closure image. Information density is low; many sentences do one job or less. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.4 baseline for loops and template cadence across the piece, escalated to −1.7 for touching closure. High-band and 9+ globally disallowed.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and no major loops. However, metaphoric density in the opening and closing paragraphs risks overwriting: "cloak of doubt hanging loosely," "hollow mirror shard, its reflective surface cracked and its core empty," and "deciphering wind chime selections" stack symbolic objects in quick succession. Template stems appear in the consultation sequence: "Aris [verb], his [noun]" recurs across multiple beats. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image: "the world felt richer, nuanced, and beautifully unresolved" tells the effect instead of showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "withheld the full explanation" / "began to speak... carefully" / "continued to withhold the key" restate the same withholding across three beats. Template cadence: "She was... She withheld... Through the trance... It was... She wove..." opening five consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors: "seeds awaiting rain," "sand under tide," "two sides of the same coin." Figurative density in nearly every line without pattern-teaching blurs momentum. The final paragraph stacks summary clauses that tell rather than show the lesson's completion, dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose carries significant paraphrase loops and template cadence: "Elara remembered the stories…"; "Elara focused its senses…"; "Elara listened intently…"; "Elara felt a profound shift…"; "Elara knew its journey was complete…" These repetitive stems dull momentum and read as generation artifacts (−0.6). Figurative language ("harmonics," "frequencies," "pulse," "resonance") clusters densely without advancing concrete action or clarifying cause/effect, especially in the final third (−0.5). Stock phrases ("weathered resolve," "timeless truth," "profound shift") replace textural specificity. Information density is low: multiple sentences restate that Elara seeks stillness or that the pulse is "wandering" without adding pressure or detail.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "find the sacred in the simple" / "sacred simplicity" / "simple beauty" / "simplest of things" recur without advancing pressure. Template cadence dominates—"He spent his days...," "He placed the keystone...," "He spent his days..."—and synonym churn ("luminance," "glow," "light") pads without new information. Stock metaphors ("beacon," "testament") and weak nominalizations ("newfound purpose ignite within him") reduce density. The final third repeats the closure effect in summary rather than landing a single charged image, triggering artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice, but paraphrase loops appear: "The hum swelled…colors blossomed" / "deep blues swirled…vibrant reds danced" repeats the same syntactic stem. "Wandered purposefully" recurs as both title concept and summary phrase without tension. Figurative language is dense in the library scene without pattern-teaching ("radiating," "pulsing," "blossomed," "swirled," "danced") and some vehicles contradict (vows "hide behind truth" yet "reveal depths"). Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loop and template cadence in high-pressure beats, and −0.3 for mixed metaphor coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "cast the coins" appears six times, "static bursts" eight times, "distill" five times, with minimal variation or added pressure in each reprise. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]" opens nine sentences, and adjacent lines frequently restate the same idea ("The prophecy stated… The backwards prophecy whispered"). Repeated sentence stems ("With focused intent… With quiet enthusiasm") and stock metaphor strings ("breathing in before the next expansion") dull momentum. These pervasive artifacts cluster in the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "echoes forgotten phrases, murmuring them back" / "the echo, crystallized through scattered light, would whisper her phrases forever"; "distant intimacy" recurs four times without reweighting. Template cadence runs pervade: "He had come... He had saved... He watched... He whispered... He walked..." (−0.6). Register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the core concept that defined his grief") without POV grounding. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings vary somewhat, but several beats loop conceptually: "His naivety made him trust" / "his naive faith held firm" / "his naivety vindicated" recycles the same trait without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("He placed… He focused… He measured… He chanted") with four consecutive "He [verb]" stems. Information density is moderate; many lines advance atmosphere or restate stakes without tightening causality. No run-on metaphors or serious grammar breaks, but clarity suffers from synonym churn around "devotion" and "naivety."

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level clarity is adequate with no major grammatical errors or spatial confusion. However, pervasive scaffold and paraphrase loops dull momentum: "This was the pain he needed to expunge, not by erasure, but by transformation through storytelling" immediately follows a paragraph already establishing that motive; "The mirrored hush of the evening allowed these stories to resonate" restates atmosphere without new pressure. Template stems recur ("He [verb]…He [verb]…"; "The resurfacing…The sapphire-hued…The trail…"). Figurative language ("mirrored hush," "spectral relic") appears frequently without pattern-teaching or payoff, and label-only phrases ("precisely humane," "embodiment of Elias's goal") replace concrete action at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "harmonize logic and intuition" / "balance she sought" / "reason and emotion" / "heart and mind align" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence: "She closed her eyes… Then, with a deep breath, she directed… The crystal began to glow… Where it fell…" in sequence. Stock metaphors ("ached with memories," "sentimental tide," "wisp of smoke that curled like a forgotten dream") dull key beats. Information density is low; many sentences restate the harmony theme without advancing action. Clarity remains high, but momentum drags under repetitive phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple template-cadence runs and paraphrase loops: "The watcher's burden was not merely to see, but to comprehend…" echoes "The watcher's burden was no longer a void…"; "This was the moment after…" / "This discovery would…" / "This object was more than…" / "The parachute buckle, glinting…" / "Through muscle memory…" repeat near-identical stems across adjacent paragraphs. Filter-verb stacks ("she knew she had to," "knew she had," "felt heavier," "struggled to feel") cluster in high-pressure beats. Stock phrases recur: "her heart pounding," "muscle memory," "hands moving with confidence her mind struggled to feel." Several sentences restate: "remembering through muscle memory, her fingers danced" is functionally repeated two paragraphs later as "Remembering through muscle memory, she input the new parameters." Informational density is moderate; some beats compress action efficiently, but scaffold persists. Apply −1.0 for template cadence and loops, −0.4 for filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and maintains clarity, but suffers from repetitive scaffold phrasing: "Kael felt nothing," "his numbness a fortress," "the brain in the jar" recur without evolving detail. Filter verbs cluster in the final beat ("felt a spark...felt...emotions flooded") where immediacy would sharpen impact. Figurative language is generic ("dam bursting," "light defines shadow") and stock metaphors do not advance scene pressure. The final paragraph compresses three major effects—merging, emotion-flood, history-stabilization—into summary rather than dramatized sequence, flattening momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "unspoken grief" / "tending to the unspoken," "mournfully eager" / "mournful eagerness," "restore lost laughter" / "restored smile," "echo chamber tunnel" repeated identically across six paragraphs. Template cadence runs ("He was… He would… He sang… He adjusted… He pulled") in the middle third dull propulsion. Figurative language ("ice thawing under a patient sun," "light through cracks") is coherent but generic. Several lines do double duty (action + atmosphere), but scaffold phrases ("This was," "Then, a shift") and conceptual redundancy ("not erased it, allowing space for new joys") reduce density. Minimal −0.8 applied for loops and template stems; no artifacts touch the closure beat directly, but spread is noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.6)
    Recurring phrases ("through the veil of sleep," "interiorized the exteriors," "boundaries of light," "make friends with uncertainty") constitute a taught pattern consistent with accumulative design, so no loop penalty applies. However, heavy reliance on abstract philosophical constructions ("dimensionally homesick," "foggy lucidity") at closure beats dulls immediacy and reduces information density. Sentence stems repeat without variation: "It waited… It felt… It understood… It saw… It gripped…" across the final third, creating template cadence (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("mist curled," "whispering knowledge") and register drift into elevated diction reduce propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "creative destruction" appears verbatim five times, "vivify/vivified" four times, "stifling destiny" three times, "penny dropped" twice—synonym churn without progression. Template cadence dominates the final third with repeated "He [verb]" stems and "the [noun] [verb]" constructions. Stock phrases cluster: "heart-stopping moment," "surge of defiance," "crack in his stoic facade." Register drifts into prompt-essay diction ("method of successive approximation," "fundamental principle of transformation") in peak beats. Information density is low; multiple sentences restate Elian's success without advancing new knowledge. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the aftermath. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.2 for loops/stems across closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.9)
    The piece exhibits pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence. Adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure: "The shard of hush had not created silence; it had revealed the silence that was always there" immediately follows the prior image. Runs of identical sentence stems appear in the final third ("The hollywood star fragment... The shard of hush... By discarding assumptions... During lunar perigee... To find the beginning..."), creating mechanical rhythm (−0.6 for template cadence). Stock metaphors ("blank canvas upon which beginnings were painted") and elevated diction that exceeds the moment's needs ("perpetual rebirth woven into the fabric of space") dull immediacy in peak beats (−0.4 for register drift and stock phrasing). Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the stated disqualification from 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8. Total deduction: baseline −1.0 in Q7, with cross-category cap applied.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.6)
    Template cadence runs pervade ("He raised…He adjusted…He wasn't calling…he was calling…"; "certain sequences…grand, cosmic design…patterns he had begun to see"), triggering −0.6 for scaffold loops and stock stems. Mixed metaphor: "stubborn belief that every problem had a solution woven into the world's fabric" conflates weaving with solution-finding without coherent vehicle. Register drift into abstract diction ("interconnected patterns," "junction where timelines bled") clashes with the deckhand's on-page lexicon. Paraphrase loop: "permanent transient existence, where nothing was solid yet everything endured" restates the concept without added pressure. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("final adjustment, the empty hourglass glowed"), disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "memories around her began to alter" / "as memories altered" / "memories of her childhood surfaced" / "each tree a moment from her past, now altered." Template cadence dominates the middle third with identical "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems across consecutive sentences. Figurative language ("fever dream architect," "rational enchantment," "texture of connection") is repeated as labels without evolution. The scaffold phrase "realistically imaginary" appears twice without added pressure, and "unsettling calm" bookends without transformation, signaling thematic convenience rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is clean with varied rhythm and no major artifacts. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is moderate; most sentences advance atmosphere or theme. Minor issues: "somber marvel" recurs three times without functional variation, edging toward decorative loop. Some lines ("moved through the translucent corridors with a measured pace, her mind adrift") carry filter verbs and abstraction that slightly dull immediacy. No loops or scaffolding that obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "assure" appears five times, "pulses" recur without variation, "vulnerable voices" and "reeling hush" are repeated verbatim. Template cadence runs through the opening third ("She was… Her motivation was… When the dead called…"). The closing paragraph stacks three near-synonyms for quiet ("reeling hush," "quiet," "calm and resolution"). Information density is low; many lines restate atmosphere without advancing situation. Applying −0.8 for loops and template cadence in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no mechanical template runs. Clarity is adequate and spatial choreography tracks across moves. Deductions: paraphrase loops in the final third ("The unremembered were no longer alone; she had stood by them" followed by "honored the unremembered" and "cherished in her memory") create synonym churn (−0.4). The phrase "crashing hush" is recycled without reweighting (−0.2). Stock metaphor in closure beat: "eternal dance" of tides (−0.3). Cumulative line-level debt: −0.9, lowering from mid-6s to 5.9.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with short declarative beats alternating with longer reflective lines. Information density is high in the ink-sequence paragraphs where memory coalesces into discrete images. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She had fetched what she needed" / "fetched her wisdom" and "deep, peaceful quiet" / "absolute quiet" recycle phrasing. Template cadence emerges in repeated "The [noun]" openers across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors intrude: "internal fires" for clarity, "steady flow of life." Figurative language clusters in final third without clear pattern payoff. Line-level clarity is good; no causality breaks, but scaffold and synonym churn accumulate to −0.6 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propels the narrative forward with minimal scaffolding. However, several passages recycle near-identical phrasing: "She stepped inside, and the world changed" followed by "The echoes here were not mere repetitions" feels like a paraphrase loop. The phrase "the death of the language" appears three times without evolving its function. Figurative density is high ("malevolent silence," "the curse eating sound," "shattered whispers scraping at her thoughts") but remains legible. The final beat's metaphor—voice as bird-flight—integrates cleanly without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory anchors are clear, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold: "their bitterness a poison that stained the soil" immediately followed by "Aris responded not with comfort, but with laughter, weaving their pain into tales," restating the transformation claim without dramatization. Template cadence appears in the final third: "The garden thrived... The changed ones moved... Aris, still undercover, watched... The old cordless phone finally fell silent... He pocketed the arrowhead." Stock metaphors ("cosmic joke," "frostbitten hope," "harmony untamed") recur without fresh embodiment. Information density drops in the closing paragraphs as summary replaces scene pressure, and the filter-verb cluster "seemed to," "felt like," "felt both" dulls immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "breaking free from old constraints" / "break free fully" / "breaking free from the mechanical will" / "testament to breaking free." Template cadence: "The orchard breathed… the trees straightened… the fruit brightened." Stock metaphors: "poured her soul," "heart light with freedom." Figurative density in closure beats—"sky-bridge stood as a testament," "seeds of beauty anew"—muddies rather than sharpens. Repeated phrase stems and synonym churn across adjacent lines trigger cumulative penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "to find where broken promises heal" recurs without reweighting; "linking absences" is restated in three forms across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence appears in runs: "He [verb]... He [verb]... He [verb]" (checked watch, remembered promises, stepped forward, placed bottle, watched, thought, turned, walked, pondered, smiled, continued). Figurative language ("thunderstorm in a bottle," "brittle hush," "stitching of torn fabric") is present but static, repeated without evolving pressure. Information density is low—many lines summarize past actions rather than advancing present beats.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structure. However, repeated metaphoric phrasing ("whispering gleam," "misting hush," "wind bells chimed") across high-pressure beats creates template cadence without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.4). "Hours bled away" and "he stood there, complete" lean toward stock constructions. No paraphrase loops or major grammatical errors, but figurative density in the final third ("stitched the silence," "cradle of potential," "reclaimed wonder") stacks without advancing concrete causality (−0.3 for density without payoff). Closure beat carries elevated diction that slightly dulls immediacy. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty, but scaffolding phrases like "The action felt natural" summarize rather than show.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.9)
    The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly, and many sentences carry dual loads (setting + character mood). However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops: "The tattered silk scarf, now radiant, dissolved into the light, its analog memories merging with the eternal library of tales" restates the scarf's fate already shown. Template cadence recurs: "She had reawakened not just memories, but the source itself" / "her eccentricity no longer just a quirk, but a key" / "no longer lonely, but filled." Stock metaphors ("stories floated like constellations") and overwriting in peak beats ("projecting scenes around her: lovers whispering in sonnets, scientists scribbling revelations") dull immediacy. Apply −0.8 for loops and stems; no closure-scene harm, so cap deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense throughout ("cipher of longing," "luminous absence," "encoded echo," "liquid dawn," "tapestry of memory") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff at closure, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "the dream was finally at rest, and so was she" echoes "profound peace" from two lines prior. Template cadence is evident in repeated "She [verb]" stems across multiple sentences. Mixed metaphor: "weave light from the palette into the air" conflates textile and visual arts without clear coherence. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmospheric layering rather than dual-purpose advancement. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and reducing line-level scores.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "enveloped secrets" appears four times with synonym churn ("coiled like serpents," "bonds loosened," "seemed to sigh"), and multiple sentences restate Elian's longing without added pressure (−0.6). Template cadence runs across the middle third ("His heart held," "His story was," "His legacy was") flatten rhythm (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("ideas...spreading its wings," "secrets coiled like serpents") and elevated diction ("improbable longing," "hush of cosmic possibility") clash with the task-driven locksmith frame, creating register drift (−0.4). Information density is low; several beats narrate micro-movements (tracing ribbon, inserting lock) without advancing goal or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentences vary in rhythm and the prose carries momentum through most beats. Information density is solid—many lines advance setting, memory recovery, and thematic weight simultaneously. Weaknesses: paraphrase loops appear ("broken constellations" recurs in adjacent lines without new pressure; "habits broke/habits had broken" and "stolen memories/memories ripped away" cycle within the opening). The phrase "this was where habits broke, where her childhood routine…had shattered" restates the same content. Template cadence runs through several mid-story beats: "She detected…she coaxed…she understood…she aligned…she stood." Accumulated line-level artifacts and loops trigger a −0.6 deduction in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is adequate; sentences mostly advance. However, several paraphrase loops dull momentum: "resilience had been mentored, and exile reversed" recaps rather than showing the ending cost. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("She lifted a shard... She handed him the shard... She guided him"). Stock metaphors and therapy-speak labels ("combative tenderness," "mentor resilience quietly") in peak beats reduce immediacy. Some figurative language is effective (shadow "caught in glass"), but density sags when scaffold ("Together, they analyzed more leaves") replaces concrete action. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but cumulative line-level debt lowers propulsion. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2) and template-cadence (−0.5) penalties plus stock phrasing (−0.3) totals −1.0 within Q7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from pervasive overwriting and template cadence. Strings of abstract compound phrases—"verdant parapet," "thunderous waterfall," "insatiable creative urge," "radiant hush," "profound sense of succor"—appear in most sentences without variation in register or rhythm. Paraphrase loops recur: paragraphs restate Elara's motivation (lines 5, 26, 31, 36) and the orchard's renewal (lines 24–26, 30, 33) without adding pressure. The phrase "radiant hush" appears four times as decorative filler. Stock metaphors ("tapestry of life," "beacon") and filter-verb stacks ("felt the insatiable creative urge," "felt a profound sense") dull immediacy at peak beats. Artifact density and loop patterns disqualify 9+ globally and trigger cumulative deductions here.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "accumulated silence" and "interlaced hush" are restated across multiple paragraphs without advancing pressure. Template cadence surfaces in the net-unraveling sequence ("Each loop she loosened…" / "With every unraveled strand…" / "As the last knot gave way…"). Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to accumulate," "seemed brighter") dull immediacy in key beats. Sentence openings vary adequately elsewhere, but these artifacts touch the closure sequence, preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe template-cadence and paraphrase-loop issues pervade. Examples: "The tone of her quest was one of shielded openness; she guarded her heart but remained alert" is immediate synonym churn. Paragraph 2 opens "The henge's mossy stones loomed" then paragraph 4 echoes "She approached the rain-scoured fresco vault"—identical stem structure. "Methodically curious" appears four times as label-only modifier. Stock metaphors ("divide between known and unknown," "whispers of the past") cluster in final beats. Information density is low; many lines restate prior content without advancement. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed to sigh") stack without voice motivation. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.4 baseline, touching closure beats warrants −1.7 total and disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong; information density is high in the library beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "letting go" recurs across adjacent lines without added pressure (lines 14–15, 19, 22, 28), and template stems cluster ("Elara…" opens five beats in close succession). The final third stacks thematic restatements—"the physics of letting go," "trust in the universal current," "sophisticated melancholy"—that loop conceptually rather than advance. Penalty: −0.6 for loops and template cadence; no figurative muddle, but momentum dulls near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles damage momentum: "ghost in code" is restated across six sentences; "driftingly alert" appears three times with minimal variation. Template cadence appears in scaffold openings ("The air hummed," "The mist swirled," "The courtyard settled"). Figurative density is high ("vessel for forgotten tales," "stories pressed like blossoms," "tendrils of code") but many metaphors feel decorative rather than load-bearing. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance. Apply −1.2 for pervasive loops and template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity is solid; spatial and causal sequencing track cleanly. However, the prose exhibits paraphrase loops ("The discovery felt fated, a puzzle waiting" / "piecing together the captain's story"), synonym churn ("affectionate yet detached" / "affectionate detachment"), and template cadence in mid-section beats ("With each floor ascended, more of the diary yielded its secrets" / "As the eighth floor approached, the diary's final entries emerged"). Stock metaphors populate closure beats ("glowing softly beneath the surface of all things"). Apply −0.8 for loops and template patterns across multiple beats; the artifacts do not obscure causality but dull line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops dominate: "memorialize," "spooled wholeness," "quietly explosive," and "dusty starlight" recur as labels without evolving function, triggering template-cadence and synonym-churn deductions. Sentences often restate the same conceptual claim across adjacent lines (e.g., "empty spaces remember" / "voids cradle echoes" / "absence can be full"). Figurative language is dense without pressure payoff ("spooled wholeness," "dusty starlight," "quietly explosive") and several metaphors are strained or unearned. Information density is low; many lines repeat the premise rather than advance it.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several artifacts dull momentum. "Profound hush" and "suspended silence" in the opening paraphrase the same absence of sound. "Her motivation was not to preserve the library itself, but to imprison a piece of the boundless sky" reads as scaffold exposition rather than discovered through action. The phrase "heightened stillness, every breath a conscious event" stacks abstract intensifiers without concrete embodiment. Template openings appear: "She had spent months," "She remembered," "She could mimic." One mixed metaphor: "imprison a piece of the boundless sky" pairs containment with infinity, creating conceptual friction without payoff. Cumulative effect: −0.8 under the artifact pack, plus minor propulsion drag.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; no loops or major scaffolding artifacts. Sentence openings show some variety, though many paragraphs begin with "She" or "The." Information density is moderate—several lines restate Elara's curiosity or the "sociable isolation" theme without advancing action. The discovery sequence reads clearly but without propulsive rhythm; the prose does not tighten or breathe in step with escalating pressure. One paraphrase loop: paragraphs restating her isolation ("feeling both grand and lonely," "sociable isolation," "alone in her achievement") without added cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies adequately with mixed sentence lengths, though several adjacent lines begin with "She" or "The," creating mild template cadence in the middle third. Overwriting surfaces in stacked modifiers: "hauntingly bright," "vivid, sorrowful clarity," "gentle, ethereal glow" appear in close proximity without pattern-teaching or earned payoff. "Driftwood nostalgia" recurs but drifts into abstraction; metaphor mixing is minimal but "whisper secrets of balance" + "dance of parts" in the hall scene blur slightly. Information density is moderate; some scaffold appears in transitional beats ("With renewed determination," "Following the prophecy's path") that could be tightened. No paraphrase loops or causality-breaking artifacts touch the closure, limiting deduction severity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and vivid images ("floating rock arches," "tarnished brass watering bell"). Rhythm modulates from lyric description to tighter action ("she gathered the others"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "Their hope was a brambled thing, tangled in the memory" and "their hope was no longer a bramble, but a vine" restate the same motif without adding pressure. Template cadence runs in the final paragraph ("The ghost watched... the ghost was gone... The bell chimed on") with identical subject-verb stems. Stock metaphors ("vine reaching for the sun") and a light filter-verb stack ("seemed to cleanse," "began to bud") dull immediacy in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.7)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and templated constructions reduce momentum: "She was beautifully flawed" followed immediately by explanatory expansion; "nested patterns" appears in three separate paragraphs with near-identical phrasing ("nested patterns of causality," "nested patterns of reality," "nested patterns of history"). Stock metaphors proliferate: "dusk bled," "weight of eras," "blanket of sound." Figurative density in most sentences of high-pressure beats (the calibration sequence) without pattern-teaching triggers the overwriting penalty. The final paragraph stacks three synonym variants of completion ("faded," "fulfilled," "at rest") within two lines, reducing propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and mostly propulsive with varied sentence structure. Information density is solid; beats advance character and action. Minor issues: "its instructions were offhandedly exact, casually detailing" is a paraphrase loop; "graceless beauty" recurs three times, twice in the final paragraph, with the last instance reading as thematic reinforcement rather than earned resonance. Template cadence appears in the assembly sequence ("She plucked… According to the blueprint, she needed… Her movements were…"). No major loops or scaffolding, but these patterns and the abstract phrasing at closure ("forged the path," "offhandedly exact nature") accumulate to −0.8 within band.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong in the ravine sequence; sentence variety supports rhythm. However, the final third suffers from paraphrase loops and summary: "his grief, once a heavy weight, now felt loosened" repeats the "loosened grief" motif without fresh imagery; "speak of Elena's legacy and the beauty of transient bonds" tells rather than shows the presentation. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he thought," "he realized") stack in reflective passages. The opening and middle beats are propulsive, but the resolution trades scene work for summary, dulling closure impact. No major artifacts obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The bottled moonlight had served its purpose, but its glow lingered in her memory. She quantified the absence of fear, incising it from her heart. Glimmering parole was not a one-time event but a continuous process." Prompt labels ("glimmering parole," "mindfully scattered," "quantifying absence," "incise") recur as undigested tokens rather than dramatized actions. Register drifts into corporate abstraction ("continuous process," "evolved," "integrated fragmentation") that clashes with the lyric fantasy setting. Stock metaphors ("swirling sea of clouds," "path of starlight") accumulate without fresh synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from extensive paraphrase loops and template cadence. "Subsume" appears five times in identical constructions; "at the close of an unspoken dream" recurs thrice without variation or payoff; "analyzing tidal pool formations" and "sandpapering rough memories" are repeated without added pressure or detail. Sentence openings follow mechanical patterns ("He descended," "He entered," "He worked," "He continued," "He looked," "He walked"). Mixed metaphors appear ("sturdy brittle tone," "pottery fired too quickly" applied to emotional states). Information density is low—adjacent lines restate content without advancing knowledge or stakes. Applying the Patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.2 for pervasive loops and template cadence across multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops ("she felt the disconnection in the people's souls, and she resolved to act" recaps prior motivation) and stock metaphors ("bridges from silos," "note in a greater song"). Template cadence appears in the opening paragraph with repeated "her X" stems. Figurative density is high in non-pressure beats ("symphony of carefully cataloged scores," "hush of borrowed starlight") without payoff. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("shared purpose and understanding") that dull closure impact. Apply −0.8 for loops and template runs; −0.4 for stock metaphor strings.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.6)
    Heavy paraphrase loops recur throughout: "entangled memories" appears nine times, "quaking reverie" four times, "broken periscope mirror" six times, all with minimal variation. Template cadence dominates ("She adjusted… She recalled… She used… She realized…"). Stock metaphor strings ("spiderweb of lines," "tapestry of borrowed hopes") and elevated diction ("epoch," "archeologist," "synaptic plasticity") clash with the mystical-fantasy frame. Paragraph-level redundancy summarizes the same transformation claim across multiple beats without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.9)
    Numerous prose artifacts cluster in high-pressure beats: paraphrase loops ("The threshold effects were like passing through veils of thought, each one altering her sense of self. But she held fast..."), template cadence ("She stepped...She took...She approached...She reached"), and synonym churn around "combinations" and "vigilance." Filter-verb stacks appear in the vault entry sequence. Stock metaphors ("latent blaze," "seeds of vigilance") recur without fresh embodiment. These patterns touch the closure beat, triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is moderate but momentum drag from repetitive stems lowers propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and sentences generally advance character or atmosphere. Rhythm modulates well between contemplative passages and the final crescendo. However, multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "intensely quiet" recurs without variation, "empathy in motion" is restated nearly verbatim across three paragraphs, and several sentences open with identical "The [noun]" stems in adjacent lines (e.g., "The sculpture was... The porcelain insulator... The stress cracks..."). Mixed metaphor: cracks as both "map" and "frozen score" without clear vehicle coherence. These artifacts dull momentum in the middle third, though the closure beat itself remains clean. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.4, metaphor inconsistency −0.3, total −1.1 from baseline ~8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but the prose carries pervasive scaffold and template cadence. Multiple sentences open with "He [verb]" (−0.4 for template runs): "He clutched," "He remembered," "He needed," "He closed," "He realized," "He correlated." Paraphrase loops appear: "correlate the scattered signs" and "correlate the magnetic whispers"; "translating silence" recurs without added meaning. Stock metaphors ("twilight bled into indigo," "void that swallowed harmony") lack fresh embodiment. Information density is low in the middle section, where backstory summarizes rather than advancing present stakes. The final beat ("he had found beauty in the difficult") is a summary statement rather than a charged image. No figurative muddle, but rhythm is sluggish and reliant on repetitive stems.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.6)
    Sentence openings show some variety but multiple linesLoop thematically: "the silence of a sleeping child, the hush of a snowfall, the quiet of a shared grief" is a list rather than pressure. The phrase "path to empathy" appears three times across the text. Template stems recur ("She realized that," "She understood that," "She felt"). Stock metaphors appear without transformation ("the air seemed to hold its breath"). Filter verbs stack in reflective beats without advancing scene.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple loops and scaffolding: "undercurrent of wisdom" appears three times in near-identical phrasing; "serenity" recurs six times across adjacent beats without added pressure; "doodle/doodling" and "wrapping paper" loop in paraphrase. Template cadence in the middle third: "She rose and approached… Her olfactory senses detected… She realized…" creates mechanical rhythm. The final third stacks filter-like constructions ("feeling the serenity," "understanding that") and summary-only beats ("she understood," "she continued") that dull immediacy. Figurative density ("tide's thought," "wildflower hush," "sea of green," "thorn in her side") clusters without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, and "tide's thought" mixes metaphors (tide as collective understanding).

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence variety is adequate; paragraph lengths shift purposefully. Clarity is maintained throughout. However, template cadence appears in the cavern sequence: "It was not sound, but something more—a coalescence of…" / "The broken arrow tip in his hand grew warm…" / "He realized this was the core…" stacks exposition in parallel stems. Paraphrase loops are present: "gathering of echoes" recurs without added pressure; "resilience" and "source" cycle without deepening. Figurative language is sparse and functional. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance setting or knowledge but few do double duty under pressure. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and loops.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity and momentum are generally sound, but template cadence runs appear: "He [verb]" openers repeat across multiple sentences ("He stood," "He moved," "He focused," "He knelt," "He rose," "He continued," "He reached," "He pictured," "He saw," "He finished," "He walked"). Paraphrase loops touch the closure: "no longer empty but full of unspoken warnings" restates earlier material without fresh pressure. Stock metaphors ("thick blanket smothering," "metallic canyon," "seeds of insight") accumulate in high-pressure beats without transformation. Apply template-cadence penalty (−0.5) and stock-phrase penalty (−0.3) in Q7; total artifact load −0.8, bringing the base down from ~6.9 to 6.1. Information density is moderate; some beats do double duty (patch discovery advances both plot and theme), but scaffolding remains ("This documentation was crucial").

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "sculpted hush" appears seven times with decorative variation; "unfetter" and synonyms recur without new pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "The sculpted hush... / Elara knew... / The amber music sheet... / She rang... / The sculpted hush... / And so, Elara..." Stock metaphors (rainbow imprisoned, river of audible color) and elevated diction ("prism-song," "oscillating repose") are stacked without embodied action. Density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally sound, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple sentences begin with "He [verb]" ("He had come," "He raised," "He set to work," "He stepped through," "He saw," "He arranged," "He felt," "He played," "He emerged," "He carefully returned," "He sat," "He was," "He had woven," "He stood," "He glanced back"). Synonym churn appears in the silence motif: "avalanchingly quiet," "profound hush," "canyon hush," "even more profound...avalanchingly quiet void." Stock metaphors ("less an accusation and more an acknowledgment," "lighter...clear") and scaffolding ("This flute was no mere artifact; it was...") dull immediacy. Information density is moderate; many lines advance atmosphere but not plot or character choice. Apply −0.8 in Q7 for template cadence and paraphrase loops; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 due to artifacts in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity is maintained, and the prose is clean with varied syntax. However, template cadence appears in multiple beats: "She fed another sheet... A new empathy transposed upon her... The deliberate ambiguity... served to further disorient" recycles the same describe-then-abstract structure. Stock metaphors ("clicking like a falling lock," "calcify into despair") and synonym churn ("disorient" / "disorientation" / "disorient" across adjacent lines) reduce density. The final third delivers multiple paraphrase loops—"the mathematics were not in the feeling, but in the space between feelings" restates the prior line's insight without added pressure. Figurative language is controlled but not fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several paraphrase loops appear: "the pendant's attribute extended it, stretching the moment like taffy" and "Time seemed to slow" restate the same effect across adjacent lines. Template cadence runs of "Kaelen [verb]" and "The traveler [verb]" flatten rhythm in the middle section. Stock metaphors ("like a phantom limb," "stretched the moment like taffy," "a canvas for something greater") reduce specificity in peak beats. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes, but mid-story scaffolding ("This was how Elara had intended it to work") reads as expository. These artifacts accumulate to −1.0 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the tight artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and concision are mostly strong; sentences advance story and atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Each emotion was a truth, a fragment of life captured in the object, proving her theory" restates the premise without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("her world tilted on its axis," "weight heavier now") and template cadence in the final third ("She had come to prove a theory, but left with..." / "She would continue her work, but now with...") dull momentum. No filter-verb stacks or major opacity, but figurative language in the revelation beat is generic.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically varied, but several patterns dull momentum. "Raveling silence" and "stoically sparkling" recur as labels without fresh specificity in peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "The silence was not mere absence of sound, but a tangible force" is immediately restated as "leaving threads of void in its wake." Template cadence: "She remembered… Now, she fought… The raveling silence responded…" in adjacent lines. The phrase "through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" bookends the piece purposefully, but elsewhere figurative language ("skeletal sentinels," "tendrils of nothingness") accumulates without adding pressure. Information density is uneven; the final third summarizes outcomes rather than dramatizing them.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "quietly determined" and "deliberate" appear in seven beats, "coax resilience from rubble" in five, often in adjacent sentences without added detail or pressure. Template cadence dominates the middle third: "He [verb]…He [verb]…The [noun]…" across six consecutive paragraphs. Synonym churn ("meek"/"quietly determined"/"azure defiance") substitutes for progression. Stock metaphors ("key that unlocked a path," "beacon of hope") dull the final third. Information density is low; many sentences restate the premise without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies somewhat, and most lines advance atmosphere or action. However, multiple passages exhibit paraphrase loops: "the very fabric of reality becoming pliable" is immediately restated as "using the shard to sense and navigate the infinite branches of existence," and "the truth he hunted was like a shadow, always receding" is followed by "he felt its mass, its gravitational pull." Template cadence appears in the vision sequence ("In one reality... In another..."). The climactic moment—"he saw his mother, her hands stained with starlight, making the choice"—relies on figurative language ("stained with starlight") that blurs concrete detail. These artifacts dull momentum at key beats, triggering cumulative deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Several lines do double duty (e.g., "The lantern room at the summit was said to be haunted, not by ghosts of men, but by the lingering echoes of drowned sailors' hopes" layers atmosphere and stakes). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; "luminescent ache" and "spectral cold" recur purposefully. Minor paraphrase loops: "climbed the spiral stairs" / "creaked open onto a profound stillness" repeats setup without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the final third ("He placed it...Then, he began...") and filter-verb stacks ("He noticed...He knew...He understood...He felt") reduce propulsion in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.7)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence across most paragraphs: adjacent lines restate "the light functions as metaphor/prophecy/transformation" without added pressure. Sentence stems repeat mechanically ("Kael [verb]," "The glass wick [verb]," "This was..."). Stock metaphors cluster without tension ("spear of emerald," "dance of precision," "bridge the mundane and mystical"). Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (storm arrival, vision sequence) without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring rather than sharpening the moment. Information density is low; most lines do one job poorly. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "saw," "knew") dull immediacy in the vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template patterns appear: "This wing was the key... its shimmering surface embodying... beauty often masked peril" restates concept without new information. Runs of "His own nature was quietly explosive; a calm exterior hid depths" and "With meticulous care, he began... focusing the sun trails through the wing's delicate scales" cycle through synonym variations. The final third stacks filter verbs and summary ("He saw that," "He understood now," "Kaelen realized") that dull momentum. Metaphor density ("silent drum," "quiet explosion," "valley-mist wonder") becomes decorative rather than propulsive, and "iridescent caution" repeats as a thesis label rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is grammatically clean with varied sentence length, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffolding. "She had calculated over years of loneliness" / "measured in lost moments and silent corridors" restates the same idea without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "The dreams were maps…each one a piece…" / "each one revealing a fragment…" recycles structure. Figurative language occasionally muddles (sorrow as "precise weight" measured in "lost moments" mixes metaphor vehicles). The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes: "grateful for its witness" tells the emotional landing instead of showing a micro-choice or gesture that embodies it. Momentum sags in the storm-tower sequence where multiple beats narrate adjustment without conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is clear and free of major grammatical errors. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm modulates between description and action. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Her purpose was to rekindle" / "her task feel insurmountable" / "she must sing them back into being" restate the same stake across the opening. Stock phrases recur: "fragile lattice," "perpetual, gentle morning," "vibrant tapestry of hope." The final paragraph summarizes emotional resolution ("collective sigh," "memories coalesce") rather than dramatizing it, dulling the closure image and triggering −0.6 for template artifacts in the ending third.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "her life defined by solitude" and "driven her into seclusion" restate the same fact; "enlarged tranquility" appears identically in four paragraphs without variation. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("She noticed… She remembered… She wanted… She felt"). Stock metaphors ("weight of paradoxes," "shadows deepened") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she noticed," "she knew") dull immediacy in peak beats. The final paragraph summarizes the arc in scaffolding language rather than propelling through image.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clean and propulsive with varied syntax. Strong specificity in key beats (wax-paper parcel, brittle pages, cold carved stone). However, several phrases loop conceptually: "creeping normality" echoed in "his own creeping normality"; "tenuous absolution" introduced early and restated late without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: "She believed...," "She began...," "She watered...," "She read..." Figurative language occasionally stacks ("guerrilla gardening," "archaeological love," "sacred artifact") without pattern-teaching. Deductions for paraphrase loops and stem repetition; no causality harm but momentum sags slightly mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is adequate. Clarity is strong; no grammar errors or spatial confusion. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "gently meticulous" recurs three times without added pressure; "luminous vows" and "radiant promises" function as near-synonyms. Template cadence: "He lifted...he slotted...He measured...He documented...He worked...He sampled...He continued...He stored." The final third stacks declarative summary sentences that dull momentum. Figurative language ("swirling patterns of luminescence," "tapestry from scattered light") remains legible but generic.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies adequately and grammar is clean. However, paraphrase loops appear throughout: "Her method was through false starts" / "She had laid a trail of false starts earlier" / "A false start earlier had made Silas think she was gone"; "the comforting unease" recurs four times without added meaning; "trust was a fragile thing" / "the sound of trust breaking" cycles without propulsion. Stock metaphors cluster in peak beats ("heart pounding a rhythm," "fear that prickled her spine," "a blanket of secrecy"). The climactic moment—"a visceral snap that Elara captured in the fob's ancient core"—tells rather than dramatizing the sensory capture. High information density is present in setting description but undercut by redundancy in key action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clarity is adequate and grammar clean. Sentence openings vary, but several beats loop conceptually: the ring "pulsed warmly" then later "steadied," the air tastes shift without consequence, and "convergence" is named three times across final paragraphs without fresh detail. The closing lines stack abstractions ("hidden truths," "living, breathing system," "bittersweet taste") rather than offering a concrete image. Figurative language is frequent but often generic ("fragrant blanket," "soft beacon"). Information density is moderate; many sentences restate mood or theme rather than advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is grammatically clean and generally clear. However, repeated abstract phrasing creates paraphrase loops: "suppressed creativity" / "sealed away" / "blocked potential" / "uncork" all restate the same concept without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in the opening cluster ("She felt… Her motivation was… Elara was…"). Stock metaphors ("flow of inspiration," "torrent," "seal had been broken") accumulate in the closure beat, reducing specificity. Final-third summary ("In the days that followed, her new works were celebrated") undercuts momentum. Information density is moderate; several sentences recount rather than dramatize.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and information density is adequate. However, numerous paraphrase loops and template cadences undermine momentum: "under the warm glow of grow-lights" / "under a toxic sky" / "under overgrown vines"; "began piecing together" / "began the journey back"; "she realized" / "she understood" / "she knew" across the final paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("heart ache," "threads of life") and scaffolding phrases ("with painstaking care," "finally, she reached") dull the line-level charge. These artifacts cluster in the closure sequence, disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"color of wonder," "tapestry of sound," "prismatic lights that danced like visible music"—creating a lyric texture but also verging on overwriting without pattern-teaching or payoff. Several lines loop or paraphrase: "the symphonies of truth were not just melodies; they were narratives" restates rather than advances. Template cadence appears in the closing paragraph with repeated "she/her" sentence openers and stacked abstract claims. Propulsion stalls in the final third as exposition supplants scene pressure, and the Cost Proof gap in Q2 traces partly to line-level summary here. Clarity remains high, but information density drops when metaphor inflates without causal work.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.3)
    Opening and midpoint beats achieve clarity and moderate information density. The final third contains paraphrase loops: "He was free, yet carrying… He walked… his nostalgia now a light burden… moved on… systems calm… inner static resolved" recycles the same resolution across five lines without adding pressure or detail. Stock metaphors ("light burden," "infinite sky," "testament to controlled chaos") cluster in peak beats. Sentence openings in the last eight lines repeat "He" and "The" stems, flattening rhythm; template cadence and synonym churn (wholeness / pieces / mosaic) dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.4)
    Loops and scaffold appear: "This was the moment the outside world intruded, bringing with it a puzzle that would demand her attention" immediately follows "today felt different" without added pressure. "Her motivation was clear: to prove that listening heals, a belief forged from years of mending broken stories" is expository intrusion. Template stems recur ("She approached… She listened… She moved… She learned… She found… She left"), creating cadence monotony across the middle third. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt a connection," "she felt the attribute," "she knew") dull immediacy. The phrase "the attribute of leads through following guide her" is a syntax artifact that obscures sense. Penalize here per the Loop/Scaffold Screen and patterned-artifact pack; baseline −0.6 for template cadence, −0.3 for filter stacks, −0.3 for one clear paraphrase loop = cumulative −1.2, with the artifact touching multiple beats but not the closure sentence itself.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "She worked as a spider spins its web" recurs three times without pressure variation; "mysterious familiarity" is asserted twice in identical phrasing. Template cadence dominates sentence openings ("She began," "She remembered," "She felt," "She entered"). Stock metaphors ("spider spins its web," "chains of her own past") and therapy-speak ("encrypt her own vulnerability as strength") cluster in peak beats without embodied cost. The closure paragraph stacks abstract summarizations ("explained through dance, liberated through code, and encrypted vulnerability as strength"), triggering −0.6 for paraphrase loops, −0.5 for template cadence, and −0.4 for elevated register drift in final beats, totaling approximately −1.5 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity is generally strong; spatial choreography tracks through docks, fields, cavern. Overwriting appears in stacked metaphors and elevated phrasing: "leviathan of gleaming silence," "cathedral for her sorrow," "tiny, steady gravity in the vast, fluctuating dark." Several paraphrase loops: "gleaming silence" recurs four times without functional variation; "fluctuating gravity" and "pockets of gravity" alternate as synonyms across adjacent beats. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "The whale would return… Elara would continue… knowing where…" creates rhythmic monotony. Information density is moderate; some sentences do double duty (gravity constrains movement while advancing plot) but reflective passages summarize rather than propel.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "whispered secrets" appears nine times; "terrestrially cosmic" five times; "smoothed hush" six times. Template cadence dominates: "The [noun] was [adjective]" and "He [verb], [gerund]" structures stack across paragraphs. Figurative language is repetitive without payoff ("tranquil blaze" recurs four times as label). Information density is low—many sentences restate the ritual's success without advancing cause or cost. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("The prophecy was silenced"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; figurative language ("celestial fireworks," "iron bones and mortar veins," "wind through an alley") remains controlled and voice-consistent. Two friction points: "a fact I accepted with a strange, mysterious familiarity, as if I had always known" loops the prompt's "mysterious familiarity" as theme claim rather than dramatizing it through action, and "our entire arrangement was built on a foundation of agreed upon lies" similarly front-loads the core concept as summary. The final third avoids scaffold and propels cleanly to the seal transfer. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats, but the early expository framing slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops dominate the final third: paragraphs twenty through thirty-two restate Elara's transformation in synonym cycles ("isolation into independence," "solitude to self-reliance," "pain into purpose"). Template cadence appears in repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems across adjacent sentences. Figurative density—"tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve," "velvet garden," "charmed skeptic"—appears in most beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. The closure image (paragraph thirty-two) is buried under two more paragraphs of thematic summary, dulling its charge.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 6–8 restate "calibrated treason" and "forgive the unfinished" without added pressure. Template cadence: "She had forged… She had been… She sought… She raised… She pressed…" runs for eight consecutive beats. Stock metaphors cluster in the final third: "chains of treachery," "prison of her own guilt," "bonds of her past began to dissolve." The stalactite refrain becomes decorative after the third mention. Figurative density in the closure paragraph ("new light kindled," "hope and renewal," "truly free") blurs into greeting-card abstraction. Apply −1.2 cumulative for loops, template stems, and figurative muddle at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "echoes were twisted" / "suppressed real echoes," "learn why some people echo" / "learning why some people echo" / "learned why some people echo" across multiple beats without added pressure. Template cadence: eight consecutive paragraphs open with "He [verb]" or "Kaelen [verb]," flattening rhythm. Stock metaphors cluster without payoff: "webs of intrigue" (×3), "progressive disclosure" (×3), "reed-blown melancholy" (×3) as unearned refrain. Figurative language in most sentences of peak beats ("voice a reed-blown melancholy," "universe's hum," "serpentine design") without pattern-teaching. Information density is low—many lines restate theme rather than advance situation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "weaves truth carefully" appears twice verbatim; "borrowed starlight" recurs five times with minimal variation; "windows of connection" is restated mechanically. Template cadence dominates: "He [verb]... He [verb]..." runs span multiple paragraphs. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed") dull immediacy in key lines. Figurative language ("frozen constellations," "star retrieved from the abyss") is frequent but unearned by scene pressure. Clarity is maintained, but density and propulsion are low.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.9)
    Rhythm is monotonous: nearly every paragraph opens with a declarative subject-verb stem ("He [verb]," "The [noun]," "Kaelen [verb]"). Paraphrase loops abound—paragraphs 11–13 cycle through "hidden patterns," "scintillatingly somber," and "whistle" without new information. Figurative language ("scintillatingly somber," "radiant, somber halo") is stacked without clear vehicle or tension. Information density is low; many lines rephrase prior content. Template cadence persists across the middle third, dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clean and propulsive, with no major grammatical errors or template cadence runs. However, several lines carry scaffold artifacts: "His motivation was singular" and "His method was clear" read as outline remnants. The phrase "Hours bled into one another as sentences slowly coalesced from the chaos" uses a stock metaphor without fresh specificity. The final paragraph stacks multiple abstract concepts ("the truth," "the curse," "the burden") in quick succession, reducing information density at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "variant allegiance" recurs without functional change, "lyrically prophetic" appears in multiple forms (speech, decree, voice), and adjacent sentences restate ("her purpose / a gritty whimsy"; "ancient shadows / histories buried in radio waves"). Template cadence runs through the middle third ("She spoke of… She interpreted… She recalled…"), and stock metaphors ("tuning fork," "tapestry of rebellion") cluster in peak beats without fresh vehicle. Heavy scaffold (−1.2 in Q7) disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is generally coherent. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "This act was more than preservation; it was an attempt to glean redemption" is immediately followed by "This sweetening was not just auditory; it was spiritual." The final third includes multiple near-synonymous restatements of the poet's purpose ("translator," "keeper," "bridge across time"). Baseline −0.6 for paraphrase loops; no additional artifacts touch closure directly, but the loops dull momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "crypt keeper's key" / "sacred artifact" / "the key" cycle redundantly, and the opening pairs "drift-ice marina" descriptions that restate texture. Template cadence appears in repeated "He [verb], [gerund]" structures. Stock metaphors ("sunset bled gold into violet," "time slipping away like melting frost") accumulate without fresh specificity. The climax is hobbled by filter verbs and abstract constructions ("felt a surge of energy," "poured his will") instead of concrete action. Figurative language in most sentences of high-pressure beats (lighthouse insertion, key adjustment) obscures rather than sharpens the mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "unyoke" appears six times, "patient revolution" five times, "restrained wildness" three times, "softly purposeful" twice—each repetition adding decoration rather than new pressure. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]... Her [noun]... The [noun]..." across consecutive paragraphs. Figurative density is high ("sculpt patience," "quiet insurrection of the spirit," "ballet of necessity and grace") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.7). Synonym churn: "unyoke," "release," "set free," "liberation" cycle without advancing meaning. Patterned-artifact penalty pack applies: −1.4 total in Q7, and artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose clarity is adequate and action sequence is followable, but the text suffers from repetitive phrasing and template cadence. Phrases like "entangled memories," "fortified vulnerability," "watchfully calm," "through empirical observation," and "reverberate" recur frequently, often as label-only mentions without fresh variation. The drought/rain framing opens and closes the story symmetrically, but the final two paragraphs loop thematically (lantern/light/freedom/justice) without advancing new information. Stock metaphors ("beacon of freedom," "chains that had bound her") appear in the climax, reducing specificity when precision would heighten impact. Sentence openings vary adequately, but the repetitive noun-phrase constructions ("The drip of water," "The echoes of those past journeys," "The lantern seemed to brighten") create a drumbeat rhythm in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively in places ("The air smelled of oil and old wood, and dust motes danced..."), but multiple phrases loop conceptually: "apology into action" recurs three times, "vibrant hush" twice in identical phrasing, "deliberate"/"deliberately" four times. The middle summarizes the repair process in a single long sentence, missing opportunities for concrete, beat-by-beat density. Filter-verb stacks appear in reflection-heavy beats ("he wondered," "he understood," "he felt a shift"), though not clustered enough to trigger the 9+ disqualification. One paraphrase loop: "This was not just about fixing an object; it was about affirming..." restates the prior line's idea without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and legible, with sensory detail and spatial clarity. However, pervasive scaffold and loop patterns degrade momentum: "Throughout the evolution" recurs three times with minimal variation; "steadily curious" and "irreverent awe" are repeated without fresh context; adjacent sentences paraphrase ("The yearning algorithm responded…" / "It yearned for a listener…"). Template cadence ("She [verb]…" / "The [noun] [verb]…") runs across multiple paragraphs. These artifacts do not obscure causality but flatten propulsion and density, triggering −0.8 cumulative in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "sensed absence" / "void" / "profound silence" restate the same concept across beats without added pressure; "forgotten songs" and "echo" recur decoratively without causal function. Template cadence appears in the investigation sequence ("The first anomaly...Then she found...The numbers, she realized"). Filter-verb stacks ("she noticed," "she realized," "she understood") dull immediacy in mid-pressure beats. Metaphor density ("graveyard of moments," "unmarked tombs," "ashes on the wind") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalty. Apply −0.8 cumulative in Q7 for loops, template stems, and figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the mirror sequence: "the fragment appeared joined with another phantom piece" follows "he did not see the shard, but a glimpse of the orb whole and glowing," restating without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the descent/travel/store arrival chain: "He would need… He descended… The journey was swift…" Stock metaphors ("shadows curled like smoke," "ice groaning like a living beast") and therapy-speak phrasing ("mapping empathy onto action") appear in peak beats without earned specificity. These artifacts touch the closure sequence, dulling line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid. However, several phrases recur as conceptual loops: "grips reality loosely" appears three times, "fold in patience" thrice, "waking changed" twice, "learn the sound of approaching endings" twice. These function as motif anchors but also create a templated cadence that flattens momentum in the middle third. No clarity breaks, but information density dips during reflective stretches. The parasol beat and ice imagery propel well.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "embrace… mismatches" / "mismatches… necessary contrasts"; "rediscover the truth" / "rediscovered the possibility"; "nurture understanding" / "to nurture intersubjective understanding." Template cadence runs appear ("He recalled how," "He realized that," "He saw how") across multiple paragraphs. Figurative density in reflection beats (vines as metaphor, weeds as companions, letter as key) lacks concrete payoff and muddies momentum. The loop and scaffold issues touch multiple beats including the closure paragraph, triggering cumulative artifact penalty and global 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.1)
    Template cadence pervades: "Through peripheral awareness, he…" recurs five times; "The [noun] [verb]" opens a dozen lines. Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third ("continued," "ensured," "remained," "became"). Stock metaphors ("living truths," "fabric of the consecrated clearings") appear without fresh grounding. The piece summarizes rather than shows pivotal acts (conjuring, consecration). Repetitive stems and synonym churn ("echo of wisdom" x9, "whisperfield calm" x4, "strangely honest" x3) dull momentum. Artifacts touch closure, triggering the Q7 cap and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.9)
    Severe template-cadence runs plague the second half: "As vines climbed… / She aimed to transmute… / Opening the map case… / Each image captured… / Her motivation stemmed… / The lavender field… / She noticed how… / Elara's perceptively calm… / One man… / He pointed… / She learned… / By showcasing… / The whimsy… / Yet the tone… / As vines climbed… / More residents… / They lingered… / Elara's dove gray map case… / She arranged…" The repetitive sentence stems and scaffold phrasing ("Her method was via," "She aimed to," "Her motivation stemmed") accumulate to −1.2. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 2–3 restate "transformation" and "pain into masterpiece" without added detail. Filter-verb stacks ("she saw," "she noticed," "she felt," "she learned") dull immediacy in mid-pressure beats. The closure paragraphs pile abstractions ("collective soul," "renewed bonds," "legacy of resilience") where concrete images would sharpen. These artifacts touch the ending, triggering the Q7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally high, but heavy overwriting clusters in key beats: "a cathedral of forgotten knowledge," "suspended hush filled the vast space, a breath held for centuries," "sonic shards into a coherent tapestry," "endless, beautiful pattern of growth." Metaphor density in the closure paragraph ("not in ink, but in light and air," "soft promise of renewal," "testament to decoded patterns") approaches ornamental saturation without pattern-teaching. Template stems recur ("She had to...," "The library...," "Elara realized..."). Paraphrase loops appear ("The shadowed library, once a tomb, now felt like a womb" / "no longer shadowed but filled with the golden light of dawn"), and the final third contains stacked figurative phrases that dull propulsion. Apply −0.8 for density + coherence issues and −0.4 for template/loop patterns; the closure beat is touched, escalating the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language pervades most sentences without clear escalation or payoff, creating density that slows momentum (e.g., "fog congealed into transient shapes," "echoes collected like dust"). Template cadence appears in multiple adjacent lines: "He recalled... He forgot... He followed... He reached..." Paraphrase loops cluster around the prophet's longing and forgetting without adding pressure. The final third abstracts the closure beat into summary ("realized," "accepting") rather than concrete action, triggering artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is strong; no orientation or causality breaks. However, paraphrase loops and thematic recycling pervade the final third: "luminous ache" appears nine times, "by the sound of a leaf falling" four times, "changelessly constant" thrice, "escape velocity" twice, "foundations shake" twice, often in near-identical constructions. Lines 22–40 repeat motifs without advancing pressure or knowledge. Template cadence: "The [noun], [modifier], [verb]" recurs across paragraphs. Information density is high early but dips as scaffold accumulates. Figurative language (clock as chaos, flare as ephemeral) is coherent but static; no mixed metaphors, yet density in peak beats leans decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.2)
    Heavy template cadence pervades: "She [verb]," "Elara [verb]," and "The [noun] [verb]" stems dominate across the opening and closing thirds, including the final paragraph. Paraphrase loops recur: "reunify" appears five times, "pulsing stillness" three times, "hymning the mundane" four times, and "decisively kind/kindness" three times without evolving meaning. Synonym churn ("execute," "facilitating," "sacred work") and stock metaphors ("fragments can hold wholeness," "light to the darkest transitions") flatten momentum. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the global 9+ disallow and high-band cap at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clean and largely free of grammatical errors. Information density is moderate; sentences advance setting and plot but often through summary rather than scene pressure. Repetitive phrasing appears: "quietly deliberate" recurs three times, and several paragraphs open with "Elara" or "She" in similar syntactic frames. The phrase "sealed awakenings" is repeated across paragraphs without evolving meaning. Figurative language is sparse and functional. The final paragraph stacks resolutions and future intentions in a way that dilutes closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "She yearned for the simplicity of before" / "Yearning sharpened into purpose"; "a cleft in certainty" / "The cleft in her certainty had widened into a chasm." Template cadence runs throughout ("She remembered… She recalled… She imagined… She felt… She understood"). Stock metaphors ("mistakes into constellations," "bridge built from forgiveness") appear without fresh embodiment. The final third contains heavy scaffold and synonym churn ("luminous clarity," "newfound peace," "brighter sky"). Applying −1.4 for loops, stems, and stock phrasing across the text, with artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, template cadence appears in the middle section: "She thought of...," "She knew that...," "With a deep breath, she stood..." stack similar stems across multiple beats. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but figurative language ("pearl of stillness," "zephyr bloom," "serpentine mist") recurs without evolving meaning beat-to-beat. The phrase "memories resurface" appears twice in identical form. No severe artifacts touch the closure image, but the elevated diction and stock metaphor strings ("the swirling mist of her thoughts") reduce propulsion in the middle third. −0.6 for template stems and metaphor density without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and pendant-exchange beats. However, repetitive phrasing appears: "protected vulnerability" recurs three times, "honeyed hush" three times, "watchful" and "proactive" twice each, creating a loop effect. The phrase "quietly proactive resolve" and "silently proactive step" are near-paraphrases. Stock metaphors ("cathedral of green," "compass pointing") and elevated constructions ("a strange, brutal pruning," "mosaic") cluster without grounding tension. The final beat avoids scaffold but some lines summarize rather than dramatize: "They would build their meaning here, in this reclaimed space, layer by patient layer."

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.4)
    Template cadence pervades: "Another apparition emerged… Another cameo… A last apparition…" structures repeat without variation. Paraphrase loops cluster (e.g., "going against the current" restated three times; "shapes of different hopes" echoed in multiple paragraphs). Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed," "knew") dull immediacy in peak beats. Stock metaphors ("bulwark," "tapestry," "door to truths") accumulate without fresh vehicle. Information density is low; many sentences restate the collection premise. Applying patterned-artifact penalties (−1.2 for template runs, loops, and filter stacks across the closure third) and rounding down.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "sacred practices" restated across four paragraphs; "golden stories" repeated nine times with minimal variation. Template cadence: "The [noun] [verbed]" runs for five consecutive beats mid-story (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("tapestry of emerald leaves," "beacon of sacred renewal") and therapy-speak ("profound peace," "emotional honesty") flatten texture. Figurative density in the final third obscures propulsion without taught pattern (−0.6). Artifacts touch closure ("spinning silently into the future" echoes prior loops), disallowing 9+ globally and capping Q7 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is grammatically clean, but multiple paraphrase loops appear: "creating patterns... this method of creating patterns"; "safekept starlight, captured... safekept starlight now eternally preserved"; "moving stillness... which had been holding its breath... moving stillness" recurs without added pressure. Figurative language is dense (clawing branches, symphony of silent vibrations) yet often inert, decorating rather than propelling. Sentence openings vary minimally in the ritual sequence, creating template cadence. Information density is low; many lines restate the premise without advancing stakes or revealing new facets.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and paragraphs breathe, but several paraphrase loops appear: "He documented each variation" is restated by "his mind weaving these observations into a mental map"; "the timer was designed not to measure time, but to harvest echoes" is echoed two lines later by "he began reassembling the device, incorporating his new understanding." Template stems recur: "He [verb]" opens six sentences in close succession. Stock phrasing ("quiet beauty," "threads of mystery," "faithful keeper") appears in thematic beats. No single artifact obscures causality, but cumulative scaffold and elevated register in peak moments reduce propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is grammatically clean and free of major errors, but information density is low; many sentences restate concepts without advancing pressure ("The grotto awaited her," "Its metallic walls reflecting the cosmos," "Inside, a shingled hush prevailed"). Template cadence is visible in repeated stems: "Next came," "Then came," "The final burden was." Stock metaphors ("steady glow," "dazzling display") and abstract phrasing ("boundary-lessly trapped," "whalebone reverie") recur without concrete anchoring. Paraphrase loops appear: "no longer boundary-lessly trapped, she felt expanded" restates earlier material. The scaffold artifacts and repetitive structures collectively lower momentum and clarity, warranting a deduction of approximately −1.2 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the piece: "here and gone" appears six times, "crystallized time" five times, "contain/contained" five times, often restating the same idea without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate ("She [verb]" stems across a dozen lines). Stock metaphors ("heart ached," "soul tremor") and the summary-laden final paragraph dull the closure beat. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance. These artifacts cluster throughout and touch the ending, triggering the high-band disqualification and substantial Q7 penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.3)
    Information density is high through the opening and middle beats, weaving lagoon imagery with Elara's interiority. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "Her ambitions...were now eroded" / "eroded ambitions she carried"; "fractured stillness" recurs four times without evolving meaning. The final paragraph stacks summary ("no longer just a scavenger," "no longer eroded, but transformed," "no longer fractured, but complete") in template cadence, triggering the −0.6 scaffold penalty. Figurative language (carousel, lagoon, ghost) is consistent but the closure beat is dulled by repetitive "no longer" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean, with varied sentence structure and purposeful paragraph rhythm. However, multiple passages loop conceptually: "maze of intentions" appears three times; "redirected flows" recurs without added pressure; "stoic wonder" is restated. Template cadence is visible in repeated "He [verb]" constructions and thematic echo in the final paragraph ("it was all about redirecting flows toward hope, one equation at a time"). Figurative density is high but some metaphors are stock ("symphony of renewal," "beacon for any future wanderer"). Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and thematic summary in the closure beat, plus −0.3 for template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is grammatically clean and sensory, but suffers from pervasive overwriting and loops. "Excruciatingly gentle" appears five times in varied constructions, "glacial hush" three times, "petrichor nostalgia" twice, and synonym churn around "silence" and "quiet" appears in most paragraphs. Figurative density is high throughout ("spectral echo," "pregnant with peace," "concert hall," "symphony she never wrote") without pattern-teaching or payoff, and elevated diction in reflective beats ("solemn dedication," "profound sense of acceptance") clashes with the close-third POV. Template cadence appears in parallel "she had" constructions across multiple sentences. These artifacts measurably dull momentum and flatten the closure image's impact, triggering penalty in the −1.2 range and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.8)
    Heavy template-cadence and paraphrase-loop issues compound across the piece. Multiple paragraph openings recycle prompt phrases ("training instincts" appears four times, "architecture of lies" three times, "hindsight clarity" twice, "serene upheaval" twice, "thoughtfully clear" twice, "silence of morning radio" three times). Adjacent sentences restate the same content without added pressure: "She aimed to salvage not the bell itself, but the reason it was lost, the core truth buried beneath generations of lies. / By training instincts, she had learned to feel the weight of untruths…" Figurative language is sparse and clear where present, avoiding muddle. Apply cumulative artifact penalty: −1.4 for template cadence, paraphrase loops, and prompt-label recycling touching multiple beats including closure vicinity. Additionally disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.9)
    Syntax varies and grammar is clean, with no major loops or scaffolding. However, figurative density is high and uniform across beats ("eyes that held the deep stillness of ancient forests," "slow, silent tide of gray," "tapestry of intricate knots," "forms woven from mist and shadow") without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to pressure. Overwriting is present but does not obscure causality; it flattens momentum by maintaining one elevated register throughout. Information density is moderate—many lines describe atmosphere without advancing choice or knowledge. Template phrasing in the final third ("carry this knowledge forward," "weave it into the world") lowers propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear and free of major grammatical errors, with controlled vocabulary and no obvious typos. However, repetitive thematic stems recur ("lonesome splendor" appears three times, "geography of healing" twice, "shadowed" and "intimate" multiple times) creating minor loops. Several sentences paraphrase adjacent content without adding pressure: "the garden shimmered with vividly descriptive scenes" is immediately followed by descriptions of those scenes, and the final two paragraphs restate Elara's mission in slightly varied language. Stock metaphors ("leaves fell like forgotten memories," "gentle ghost") and elevated abstractions in peak reflective beats dull immediacy. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmosphere without advancing plot or choice. Template cadence and paraphrase loops trigger cumulative penalties within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym chains weaken line-level craft: "His motivation was simple yet immense" → "a lonely crusade"; "The egg felt bitterly sweet" recurs without added pressure; "hypothesizing about everything" appears four times with slight variations. Template cadence is pervasive: "He hypothesized that…," "He knew he must…," "He began to…" across adjacent lines. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") stack in high-pressure beats without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. Figurative language is generic ("spark of pure, organic beauty," "cut through the mechanical noise"). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("The prince, no longer bedraggled but radiant"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence-level clarity is adequate, but template cadence and paraphrase loops accumulate throughout. "Her motivation, today and always, was to prove that scars could sing" is restated via "Scars are like stories...they sing" and again in the final line. Runs of identical stems ("The clouds migrated...The girl began...Elara listened...") appear without variation. Stock metaphors—"clouds like gentle brushes," "song of her scars"—blur specificity. The final paragraph stacks summary and abstraction ("kelp-drift calm," "her own redemption"), dulling momentum. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence, plus −0.3 for figurative density without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is mostly clear, but several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "They were like ghosts, pleading for release, and she was their only hope" closely echoes "the memories that deserved to be free" two lines prior. The phrase "stained glass box" appears eight times, often in identical syntactic slots. Figurative language is dense without always advancing pressure ("prism that refracted certainty into spectra of doubt" is ornamental at the opening). Stock metaphors ("beacon of hope") and synonym churn ("whispered," "called," "pleading") dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is clear and grammatically clean, but it suffers from template cadence and paraphrase loops. Runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" sentences flatten rhythm across high-pressure beats. Several adjacent lines restate the same idea: "The garden was dying, its light dimming from within" followed immediately by "To share light without using fire meant she could not reignite the fading cores" rehearses the same limitation. Stock phrases ("troubling serenity," "profound peace mixed with sorrow") appear in peak moments without fresh embodiment. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance concept or atmosphere but few do double work, and scaffold lines ("This was the source of the troubling serenity") slow momentum rather than propelling it.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The ancient greenhouse, with its crumbling structure and resilient flora, became a cathedral..." restates the opening's ivy-veiled frame; "grief's shape was fluid, connective, and beautiful, like the intertwined ribbons or the airborne dance" recycles the same thesis across adjacent lines. Runs of "She [verb]" stems (noted, realized, rolled, walked, smiled, knew) flatten momentum. Stock metaphor "thundering calm" appears five times without evolving. Clarity remains intact, but information density is low—many sentences restate rather than advance. Deduction: −0.8 for loops and template stems in Q7; no closure-beat artifact observed, so cap not triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "incremental absolution" appears six times, "shared balance" four times, "searing reverie" three times, often in adjacent paragraphs restating the same emotional state without new pressure. Template cadence dominates: "He [verb], [noun]" and "The [noun] [verb]" sentence stems repeat across dozens of lines. Stock metaphors ("darkness no longer a shroud," "burned away the dross") and therapy-speak labels ("profound clarity," "emotional flatlining") appear in peak beats, dulling specificity. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("Elias felt whole again"), triggering the elevated penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the piece: "uncharted echoes" appears five times across paragraphs 8, 19, 27, 35, 38 with minimal functional variation; "velveteen gloom" recurs in paragraphs 2, 13, 36 as decorative repetition. Template cadence runs dominate: "She [verb]" stems structure at least eight sentences (paragraphs 11, 12, 14, 15, 26, 30, 37, 39). Stock metaphors ("echoes that seemed to vibrate," "threads seemed to pulse") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she sensed," "she knew") dull immediacy in peak beats. Sentence rhythm is monotonous, with most paragraphs opening on subject-verb-object constructions. Information density is low: many sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "his life's work, writing the future" / "he began to write, not the future itself, but a story that would model it"; "the constraint was the society's fear" / "the constraint of fear was being replaced by the constraint of shared purpose." Template cadence runs dominate the middle: "He adjusted... He closed... He dipped... He began... He described... He continued..." The opening and closing gestures ("before the pen meets the blank page" / "the pen had met the page") bracket the story symmetrically but do not charge the final image with new pressure. Figurative language is sparse but mixed: the kingfisher feather "seemed to glow with an inner light" after being described as iridescent blue, and "frozen potentials" mixes thermal and modal metaphors without clear vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is mostly clean with purposeful rhythm, but several loops and scaffolding phrases reduce density: "She realized this was a method" (line 9) and "This confirmed her belief" (line 26) are summary rather than dramatization. Figurative language ("thistled calm," "shortwave radio dial...a device from a brighter past") is purposeful but occasionally tips into decorative territory without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("She learned," "She resolved," "She began") with repetitive sentence stems that dull momentum. Overall information density is solid but not exceptional; minor paraphrase loops and stock transitions reduce propulsion in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.6)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs drag momentum: "She approached... Upon it rested... He had always spoken... The core concept... She had constructed..." in consecutive beats; "This was her way... This amalgam would become... This method..." recur without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("shroud," "ghostly and ethereal") and label-only emotion ("somber marvel" appears three times without embodied texture). The final third stacks these artifacts, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the piece. Lines 4, 13, 20, and 26 all restate Elara's agonizing without adding pressure. Repetitive sentence stems dominate: "She agonized…," "The cog…," "Her rational rebellion…," "Competing narratives…" appear multiple times with minimal variation. Stock metaphors ("whirlpool of doubt," "anchor the future") dull the prose. The loops and scaffold obscure momentum and flatten the closure beat (lines 26–27 repeat the setup from line 18 without advancement). Apply cumulative artifact penalty: −1.7 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence accumulate across the piece: "She was expectantly resigned, a state she had cultivated" / "Her motivation...felt more urgent"; "the traveled stillness of the library seemed to deepen" / "The traveled stillness settled over them"; "Across unlearning hatred, she had learned" / "Across unlearning hatred, they had found." Figurative language clusters heavily ("velvet library," "plush velvet nap," "gilding motes," "honeyed glow," "mosaic of apprehension") without pattern-teaching or payoff; mixed metaphors appear ("vanishing arts whispered from the shelves," "patchwork of ages"). Stock metaphor strings and synonym churn ("stillness," "quiet," "silence") dull momentum. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("traveled stillness," "across unlearning hatred" repeated), triggering the artifact-at-closure deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe template-cadence and paraphrase-loop issues: "She knew that to prune…" / "She recalled…" / "She began to prune…" / "She pruned another…" / "She knew that by pruning…" creates repetitive syntactic scaffolding. Synonym churn on "gentle rebellion" (five mentions), "synaptic plasticity" (four mentions), and "create beauty from ruins" (three near-duplicates). Filter-verb stacks: "She could almost taste," "She knew," "She felt," "She aimed." Stock metaphors: "weave beauty from decay," "pages of a forgotten book." Information density is low—many sentences restate her mission without advancing situation. Final third pervaded by these artifacts; disallow 9+ globally and apply −1.4 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the final third: "wonder remained" / "wonder that saved us" / "preserve the wonder" / "guard wonder like a precious flame" recycle the same abstraction across six paragraphs. Template cadence runs—"She opened… She closed… She walked… She had…"—flatten propulsion. The riddle exchange summarizes key causality ("condensation… sensors got wet") rather than dramatizing discovery. Figurative language ("canvas for wonder," "lullaby of restored harmony") stacks without coherent vehicle. Clarity holds, but density and momentum erode under synonym churn and scaffold repetition in peak and closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs appear: "hushed blaze" recurs three times without evolving meaning; "inadvertently profound" and "displaced objects" are restated across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("pink snow," "daydream," "quiet fire") cluster in peak beats without transformation (−0.4). The orris-root explanation is told rather than dramatized, and "She realized" / "She knew" scaffold sentences dull momentum (−0.3). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("she knew," "the night embraced her"), triggering the final-third disallow-9+ rule and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "cascading revelations" appears six times; "incisively kind" recurs without varied embodiment; "welcoming nuance" is restated across multiple paragraphs. Template cadence: "The statue recalled…," "The statue learned…," "The statue realized…" runs through the middle third. Stock metaphors ("waves against the shore," "thread in a larger tapestry") and therapy-speak ("sorrow in the silence, hope in preservation") flatten texture. Line-level clarity is adequate, but density is low and momentum stalls in expository blocks.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "boundless confinement" / "endless progress toward nowhere" / "infinite ascent" restate the same idea across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate ("She was," "She believed," "She sought," "She adjusted") with identical stems across seven consecutive beats (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("fading light," "canvas for her dreams," "threads of the old") cluster in the final third without fresh vehicle or specificity. The rupture beat—"crack appeared... symbols glowed... rupture was not destruction but revelation"—uses passive constructions and abstract nouns where concrete action would sharpen the turn. Information density is low; many sentences restate theme rather than advance situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "She painted… The greenhouse filled…," "She saw… She felt…," "The words… the kindness…" across adjacent lines. Multiple beats open with identical stems, triggering −0.6 for template runs. Stock metaphors ("drink the pale light," "tapestry of human goodness") and synonym churn ("roused," "rouse," "rousing" in three paragraphs) add −0.4. Figurative density is moderate; no mixed metaphors harm clarity. Information density is low—many lines restate the proof-gathering loop without advancing choice. Non-closure artifacts prevent 9+ eligibility globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clean with varied syntax and strong imagery ("hair-line scratches on the brass casing," "slippery rocks," "swirling 'E'"). Information density is high; each paragraph advances discovery or stakes. Two friction points lower the score: "rosewater dread" appears four times with diminishing return, approaching loop territory; the phrase "a map of her displacement" and "rattling breaths" lean slightly purple. The climax paragraph stacks feeling-labels ("warmth," "profound, cultural thaw") where image alone would suffice. No grammatical errors or major artifacts, but template rhythm in the ledger-search sequence ("An old woman… Another remembered…") briefly flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; nearly every line advances setting, mood, or progression. Overwriting clusters in the final third: "directionless fragments," "hollow freedom," "silent, reversed downpour," and "beautiful, terrifying chaos" stack abstract modifiers without sharp image. "Bleak exhilaration" appears twice in close proximity, the second time as "a raw sound of bleak exhilaration," which reads as paraphrase loop. Figurative language is dense—"tangled thread of cause and effect," "fabric of her own history loosen"—but remains coherent and voice-consistent. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose carries several template patterns: repeated "a [noun] that [verb]" constructions ("allure that both sickened," "rhythm in her chest," "weight she knew"), filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("seemed to drink," "felt more than saw"), and paraphrase loops ("fear is a paradox" / "your weakness is that you cannot exist"). The climax beat ("absorbed the object, the cursed darkness within it meeting the manufactured light") muddles vehicle logic—how does absorption create explosion? Clarity holds in spatial choreography, but information density drops in the final third as summary replaces scene.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.2)
    Heavy overwriting throughout: "fragile, luminous dome," "shifting greys of the horizon," "ever-evolving lattice of harmony," "million ringing droplets" stack modifiers and abstract metaphors without propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: the prophet's gift to "interpret cloud movements" is restated multiple times without new detail. Template cadence: "He stood…," "He moved…," "He continued…," "He raised…" across five sentences in the final third. Register drifts into technical jargon ("fractal generator," "sympathetic resonance," "sketched resonance") that flattens voice. The closure beat—"knowing his work was never done"—summarizes rather than imaging cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and most sentences advance story or atmosphere. Some scaffold remains: "He was a man of quietly driven purpose, his ambition a silent engine" leans abstract, and "The tone of the city was one of sunwashed dread" tells rather than showing through specific sights or smells. "He did not blow it randomly; he played the sequence he had derived" is a paraphrase loop (the next line restates the same idea). Figurative language is mostly clean, but "his purpose was shared, a seed planted in the cracked earth" stacks metaphors without clear payoff. Information density is high in the whistle-correlation sequence; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean, grammatical, and largely free of artifacts. Sentence variety is adequate; paragraph structure varies purposefully. However, multiple beats rely on similar syntactic stems ("She felt," "She spread," "She deciphered," "She carefully photographed") and conceptual rephrasing ("Her method was her greatest strength" / "This was her emotional rationality at work"). Stock metaphors appear without transformation: "pit of lies," "web," "gateway," "tomb." The closure paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image and action. Information density is moderate; several lines repeat the same idea in adjacent sentences (e.g., the scribe's innocence is asserted, then re-asserted, then proven). No loops severe enough to obscure causality, but the cumulative effect is scaffolding that dilutes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting is pervasive: "hushed blaze" appears three times, "interlaced absence" twice, "wrest/wrested" four times, and "stoically sensitive" twice, creating synonym churn and template cadence without pattern-teaching or payoff. Metaphoric density is high ("granite hiding...silt," "aqueous twilight," "quiet ember") but several vehicles contradict (a "blaze" cannot be "hushed" without irony the text does not signal). Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph three restates Elias's method across adjacent sentences. Information density is moderate; lines often elaborate rather than advance. These artifacts do not obscure the closure image but dull momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is clear and generally rhythmic, but scaffold and label-repetition accumulate: "tranquilly perceptive" appears twice, "reclaimed stillness" three times, "dappled resolve" twice, and "antique ink stamp" four times, often as isolated descriptors rather than integrated action. Synonym churn is visible in adjacent lines: "profound dark" / "abyssal hush," "calm lake" / "total blindness," "forgotten library" / "sunken silence." Several sentences begin with similar stems ("She [verb]," "The [noun]"), creating template cadence in the middle third. Figurative language ("light filtering through deep water," "shadows of uncertainty") occasionally stacks without advancing concrete pressure. Information density is moderate; some beats ("using the stamp's edge, she gently probed") do multiple jobs, but others paraphrase prior content ("This tactile feedback was her new data point" restates the function of the stamp mark). The loop and scaffold issues do not obscure causality but they dull momentum and introduce a slightly mechanical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "transmute sorrow into hope" / "grief into art"; "polished gem" / "polishing method" / "gem polishing" recur without functional variation. Template cadence clusters in the middle third ("She polished… She felt… She finished…"). Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching ("luminous torment," "captive fireflies," "paper wings glowing," "fleet of luminous cranes")—metaphors stack without coherent vehicle logic. Register drifts into abstraction ("luminous torment defined her existence") during peak beats. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content or narrate insignificant micro-movements.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is largely clean with strong propulsion and varied syntax. "Intangibly tangible" and "bleak exhilaration" appear multiple times, bordering on echo but serving as thematic anchors rather than loops. The phrase "a state of being. A bleak exhilaration settled over him" uses sentence fragments purposefully for rhythm. Minor template cadence in the middle section ("He was hunting... He saw echoes... He was getting closer") but beats remain distinct. Information density is high; no scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The final paragraph's rhythm supports the closure image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "missing pieces" recurs four times without evolving meaning; "brilliant dimness" is restated as "brilliant dimness" three times; "perpetually surprised" is repeated verbatim. Template cadence: "He felt…," "He knew…," "He would…" runs across the final third. The passage "The frequency of belonging hummed on, a timeless connection that wove through the universe and within his soul" stacks modifiers without propulsion. Closure beat is dulled by summary ("forever surprised by the wonders they revealed").

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting is pervasive: "the air thick under the weight of unspoken words," "a burden she carried daily," "the rising tide of remorse," "a core of tempered regret" stack figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff, violating density and coherence checks (−0.7). Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "gnawed at her, a burden she carried" and "twisted her insides" restate guilt without added pressure (−0.2). The final third ("heavier than any stone, a palpable force," "mass and measure," "tempered regret") layers metaphor in peak beats, reducing clarity (−0.5 escalation). Template cadence: runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" across multiple paragraphs flatten rhythm (−0.4). Total artifacts and loops justify the score and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose contains multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence. "The wind howled...a furrowed hush" contradicts itself within one sentence. Repeated sentence stems ("She had...," "Elara...") and synonym churn ("untether" used three times, "recycle" twice) create a mechanical rhythm. Filter verbs cluster in reflective passages without voice motivation. The final third escalates these artifacts: "she allowed herself a moment of peace" immediately followed by "a rare sight in her line of work" is expository scaffolding that dulls momentum. Figurative language is often mixed or strained ("mist clinging like a shroud," "furrowed hush").

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is maintained; no causal breaks or spatial confusion. However, paraphrase loops and thematic label repetition accumulate: "merrily melancholic" appears five times, "align heart and action" four times, "backlash of regrets" four times, "flickering faith" three times, "gravitate" four times—often without new pressure or detail. Template cadence is present in adjacent sentences: "He was moving, acting… He had been relying on… He didn't need the stars…" Figurative language (compass as symbolic weight, lighthouse as beacon of dreams) is functional but stock. These artifacts do not obscure closure but dull momentum and density. Baseline −0.8 for loops and labels, escalated to −1.2 because they cluster in the final third and touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "His journey began…" / "Leo's fingers traced…" restate the newspaper clue; "He felt a jaded wonder…" / "With jaded wonder, he acknowledged…" recycle the phrase without added density. Template cadence runs ("He reached…He held…He stepped…He felt…He threw…He realized…He left") across a dozen lines with identical stems. Stock metaphors ("stubborn stain," "barren soil of his heart," "fluid maze") and synonym churn ("delicately robust" appears four times) dull momentum. The final third stacks summary sentences that re-explain prior content, violating the paragraph-cut test. Apply −1.4 for pervasive artifact spread and −0.3 for final-third presence; disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity is maintained; no confusing pronoun references or spatial impossibilities. However, pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "The orchard bloomed... The orchard faded... The orchard bloomed on" recycles the same anchor; "After the phoenix had risen... After the phoenix rose" repeats the timeframe marker without added pressure. Runs of "She had... Then came... followed... Finally" and "Together, they would... And in that... The beast whisperer and her griffin were together again" create a mechanical rhythm. Figurative language in most lines ("captured stars," "liquid silver," "breathing entity") without pattern-teaching. These artifacts cluster throughout, including near closure, triggering accumulated penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with vivid imagery ("drowning in stars," "jagged shadows," "liquid time"). Information density is moderate; some sentences do double duty (e.g., tablecloth description anchors family custom and setting prop). However, paraphrase loops appear: "a longing to grasp the seconds and years that had vanished into the ether" echoes "moments she had let slip away" within two sentences. Several beats rely on filter verbs and abstract emotion labels ("sharp ache," "tight with unshed tears") that soften immediacy. The "choking beauty" motif recurs without escalation, reading as decorative rather than pressure-building.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.4)
    Opening and midpoint lines are vivid and purposeful. Sentence rhythm varies, though several beats rely on template structures: "She had to [verb]" appears thrice, and "Her [noun] was [noun]" recurs. Figurative language is dense—"patchwork tomb," "ghostly resolve," "tapestry of shared human experience"—without muddle, but concentration in the climax ("blazing with incandescent light," "brilliant point," "golden light") approaches overwriting without matching embodied action. No major loops or scaffold, but the final beat summarizes emotional state ("weightlessness... of spirit," "serene, unshakeable happiness") where image alone would suffice. Clarity and grammar are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and thematic restatements pervade the second half: "transformation was not an end, but a metamorphosis"; "texture of transformation was like light on dark sand, a contrast that revealed beauty. It was smooth yet intricate, gentle yet profound"; "transformation was not a destination, but a journey without end." Template cadence runs ("She knew… She understood… She realized…") cluster across multiple beats without pattern-teaching. Stock metaphors ("morning dew," "tiny heartbeats," "seeds of gain") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she knew") dull immediacy in peak moments. Information density is low in the final third, where summary replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn flatten momentum: "cradle of sparks" appears five times with decorative variation but no added pressure; "silent revolution" and "winking hush" recur as placeholders. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]…She [verb]…" runs across multiple paragraphs without syntactic variety. Key beats are summarized ("worked quickly, distributing the leaflets") rather than shown, and figurative language ("a thread of hope in the gloom," "a canvas for her invention") stacks without coherent vehicles or embodied grounding. The final third loops thematic labels ("The silent revolution was underway, soundless and sure") in place of propulsion. Combined artifact penalties (paraphrase loops, template stems, stock metaphor strings, summary-only pivotal action) and the spread into the closure paragraph trigger cumulative deductions and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; no paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Sentence openings are diverse and the read-aloud test passes cleanly. However, several lines lean on stock metaphors ("twisted like eels in a net," "tapestry above him") and the closure beat summarizes understanding rather than showing it through action or image. The final paragraph stacks declarative summary sentences ("for the first time in years," "no longer chaotic," "everything made sense"), dulling propulsion at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "vigil was in pause" / "that vigil was in pause now" / "the vigil was no longer in pause" recur without added pressure. Synonym churn: "furiously tranquil" / "at peace with the rage" / "calm wonder" stack the same idea. Template cadence runs through multiple beats ("She had come… That envelope… Now, in this high place…"). Mixed metaphor: "rarefy" (gaseous) applied to thoughts and verses without coherent vehicle. These artifacts dull the closure image (−1.4 in Q7 per the pack, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high bands at 8.8).

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates adequately. However, loop and scaffold debt accumulates: "Kaelen's mechanical arm… twitched as he calculated" / "His mechanical arm… raising the sword" repeat the arm-as-gesture without new information; "dignified chaos" appears thrice without evolving meaning; "the questions of yesterday now charting a course for tomorrow" and "turn questions into destinations" are near-synonyms. Metaphor density in the fencing beat ("each strike a syllogism, each parry a counterargument") stacks without causal linkage, reducing clarity. The final paragraph lists resolutions ("lighter," "journey ahead gleamed," "testament") rather than advancing through image. Copy is clean; no typos or tense errors. Deduction for paraphrase loops and metaphor stacking in peak beat: −0.6 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean and grammatically correct with varied sentence structure and no major loops. However, several lines engage in paraphrase without added pressure: "Each book placed felt like a brick laid in the foundation of their shared dream" restates the prior beat's intent. Template cadence appears in the opening third with repeated "her/she" sentence stems. Stock phrases—"companionable silence," "gentle urgency," "whispered verse"—dull specificity. The closure paragraph stacks abstractions ("endless, luminous beginning") rather than concrete image. Information density is moderate; many sentences perform atmospheric work without advancing character or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and spatial choreography is clear. However, several loops and scaffold phrases reduce density: "strategically creative" appears twice in identical phrasing; "steely longing" recurs three times without reweighting; "the broken anniversary clock" is named twice in similar constructions. The phrase "His motivation was simple, yet immense" is expository scaffold. Mixed metaphor: "cold fire that refused to be extinguished by regret" contradicts itself (fire/cold, extinguish/regret). The final paragraph over-explains closure rather than trusting image, and the line "This was his refuge, a temporary sanctuary woven from memory and light" paraphrases the action just completed. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and synonym churn touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade adjacent paragraphs: "The collective memory was now secure" / "cultural memory was safe" / "With cultural memory protected" recur without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate: "The monsoon arrived… The ridge… The cultural memory… The knowledge fruit seed…" Stock metaphors ("living tapestry," "heart remained protected") flatten specificity. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she realized," "she knew") dull immediacy across multiple high-stakes beats. Clarity is maintained but information density is low; many lines restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries vivid descriptors ("rhythmically placid," "tides of remembrance," "cerulean regret") but these recur as labels across multiple beats without advancing pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "not a single shade, but a spectrum" followed by "was cerulean, but it was also the silver." Template cadence in several passages ("He had come… He had heard… He recalled…") flattens rhythm. The final two paragraphs summarize rather than propel, and figurative density ("diffuse your intentions… spread them out like mist") accumulates without clear payoff.

No overwriting or register drift; syntax supports emotional beats, like the gradual unfolding of the gateway.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lyrical and dense, with varied sentence structures and rhythmic control that supports momentum—e.g., "The air crackled, and the photographs floated around her." Information density is high, with lines advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor scaffold exists in repetitive stems like "she began" and "she worked," but no artifacts obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits strong rhythm and clarity, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere efficiently. Information density is high, as in "Their faint glows were tangible reminders of the hope she had once spread." No major artifacts, loops, or scaffold issues; figurative language is coherent and supports pressure. Minor overwriting in phrases like "vibrant hush" is balanced by purposeful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently, with clear propulsion in key beats like the distribution. No figurative muddle or register issues in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, and sentence rhythm varies naturally to support scene needs without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and clarity is maintained in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with good rhythm, but overwriting issues include mixed metaphors ("crystal cage of light and shadow") and template cadence in some beats, slightly obscuring clarity without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with no muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere concisely, and the final image lands with clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, such as "steely longing" and "solid light." Line-level craft supports momentum without obscuring causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose has good rhythm and density, with vivid imagery and no major loops or artifacts. However, occasional abstract phrases like "luminous doubt" create minor figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; sentences vary naturally. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; "cerulean regret" is voice-motivated. Propulsion clear, with closure image undulled.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are mostly clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with some strong images (“city-sized sphere of unimaginable density,” “soft, accumulating memory of the storm’s passage”). There is mild conceptual and phrasing repetition around “gradual change,” “decay,” and “drama,” plus a few near-platitudinous lines that feel like scaffolding rather than sharpened insight. Still, clarity is never lost, and figurative language is controlled rather than purple.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clean and readable, with mostly smooth syntax and no major grammatical issues or true confusion about sequence. There are effective images (“scorched at the edges, a testament to the fire”) but also a tendency toward repeated conceptual phrases and near-paraphrases, especially around “purpose,” “resonance,” and “pauses.” Figurative language clusters in similar registers, giving sections a mildly uniform, slightly purple feel without fully bogging momentum. Tighter cuts of redundant lines and more varied, concrete imagery would elevate the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, with strong information density: most sentences carry setting, emotion, and concept simultaneously, and there are few outright redundancies or scaffolding lines. Imagery (winterglass, frost-etched flora, heat-mapped colors) is coherent and not overly mixed, though some phrasing trends toward abstraction or repetition (multiple “rectify”/“emptiness”/“silence” formulations) that slightly dulls momentum. Syntax is varied enough to avoid monotony, and grammar and sequencing are clear. Occasional on-the-nose formulations (“visual opera,” “new form of music”) read as explanatory rather than letting the already-powerful images stand, keeping this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clear, mostly concise, and maintains momentum; each sentence tends to carry story, tone, or image, with minimal scaffolding. There are a few familiar metaphors and phrases, but not enough to feel purple or clichéd, and information density is good for the length. Rhythm varies reasonably well between longer, atmospheric lines and tighter action. The line-level craft supports the piece effectively, even if it rarely surprises at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatical, with reasonably varied sentence structures and few outright redundancies. Descriptions often do double duty for atmosphere and character, and there are no major figurative muddles or obscuring artifacts. That said, several phrases and micro-beats repeat conceptually (quiet, persistence, gratitude, “amplified quiet”) without adding new pressure, and some telling could be trimmed for sharper impact. Line-level craft is solid but not yet razor-edged for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: sentences are clear, sensorially grounded, and seldom feel mechanically patterned. There is some redundancy and mild purple-prose drift (“spiritually curious heart,” “world felt new, washed clean”), along with a tendency to explain realizations that the images already imply. Nonetheless, momentum is maintained and the closure image is not obscured by figurative muddle. A modest tightening of abstractions and repeated insights would bring this closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally well-paced, with sentences that do multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus theme, action plus mood). However, there is a tendency toward abstraction and purple-leaning metaphor stacks—“quaking reverie,” “infinite loom of moments,” “texture of time”—that sometimes blur rather than sharpen emotional immediacy. Some ideas and images are reiterated without added pressure, creating mild redundancy. Despite this, clarity and momentum are maintained, and no line-level issues significantly disrupt closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatical and generally clear, and information moves forward without major confusion. However, there are noticeable repetition and scaffold issues: phrases like “staggering grace,” “when the wall came down,” and restated motivations recur without adding new pressure or nuance. Some imagery leans on familiar formulations (“pale moon,” “dust and despair”) rather than fresh, specific language. Line-level craft is functional but not tight or surprising enough for elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is often strong, with many sentences doing double duty—advancing atmosphere and theme together (“memories clung like salt,” “soft, crumbling echo”). The prose does flirt with purple and conceptual repetition, especially around cells dividing, absences, and memories, creating a mild sense of sameness in the middle. Still, clarity remains high, syntax varies reasonably, and there are few true scaffolding or loop artifacts. The final cadence lands cleanly, even if some key beats are summarized rather than turned in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally polished: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, and most images do double duty for mood and world-building. However, the prose occasionally leans into purple—stacked modifiers, repeated glowing/light metaphors—that risk softening impact instead of sharpening it. Some phrases recur without deepening (“luminous disbelief”), creating mild echo rather than purposeful pattern. These are refinements rather than structural flaws, but they matter at a top-tier standard.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is smooth, mostly lean, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Imagery is clear and rarely overwrought, and the line-by-line progression is easy to follow without scaffolding or loops. There are a few abstract or slightly purple turns of phrase and some thematic repetition, but not enough to drag momentum or obscure sense. Overall, the language is polished and publication-ready with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are generally clear, grammatical, and purposeful, with vivid imagery and few outright redundancies; the piece reads smoothly at the line level. Some phrases do double duty, pairing atmosphere with psychology (e.g., the skeletal library mirroring Leo’s sense of exposure). At the same time, the prose leans toward purple or abstract at moments (“trembling certainty,” “transformative betrayal,” repeated thesis lines), and there are mild repetitions of concept and cadence. Tightening these and trusting concrete action over rephrased insight would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clear, well-controlled, and rhythmically pleasant, with a good balance of image and exposition. There is some repetition of concepts (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush,” summarizing silence, her obsession) that could be compressed for greater force. Figurative language is mostly coherent and not over-stacked, though a few phrases feel like aesthetic layering rather than necessity. Line-level craft is solidly above average but lacks the absolute precision and compression expected in the most competitive venues.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is mostly clean, grammatically sound, and free of serious artifacts; sentences advance atmosphere and idea with reasonable economy. There is some redundancy in phrasing (repeated emphasis on “looped timelines,” “amalgamate,” and similar constructions) and a tendency toward abstract summary (“This insight was both mundane and mystical”) where a more concrete image could carry weight. Overall momentum holds, but the line-level work feels workmanlike rather than sharply honed.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence-level craft is clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with some nice images (the crystals “capture and softly whisper every distant noise”). There is noticeable redundancy and phrase looping around key motifs, which slightly blunts their impact over time. Several paragraphs summarize emotional states and outcomes that could be more powerfully dramatized. Overall momentum holds, but the prose rarely compresses multiple layers of meaning into a single sharp line.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, with a clear rhythmic pattern. Nonetheless, it leans heavily on repetition of key phrases and concepts, resulting in paraphrase loops that don’t add new information or pressure (“blooming withering,” “mended deception,” and polished marbles as symbols reappear almost identically). Much of the narration tells in summary rather than showing through fresh, concrete action, which dulls momentum. The line-level craft is solid but neither particularly tight nor surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and clear, with good information density and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Some phrases and structures recur (“hush of beating wings at rest,” repeated “mechanically warm”), and a few lines verge on purple or explanatory, particularly near the ending. Figurative language is mostly coherent and not over-stacked, so momentum holds. Overall it’s publishable-level craft, though it lacks the compression and surprise at the sentence level that would distinguish it in a top market.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is clean and vivid, with concrete images (“water dripped from the ornate ceiling, each drop disrupting the profound quiet with a soft plink”) doing multiple jobs at once. There is some structural repetition in sentence openings (“She…” clauses) and occasional conceptual redundancy, but not enough to drag momentum significantly. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and clarity of action and causality remains intact. The prose is polished and publication-ready, if not formally electrifying.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with few wasted sentences and a good balance of image and exposition; the prose reads smoothly. Some phrases and constructions recur (“occupying margins,” “swaying certainties,” “auroral sorrow,” “weight of the swallowed truth”) in ways that flirt with thematic hammering rather than purposeful pattern. A handful of sentences explain what the images already imply, slightly reducing density and momentum. There are no major figurative misfires or clarity issues, but the piece lacks the sharp compression and risk at the sentence level that would mark it as immediately publishable in a top market.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; sentences often advance setting, mood, and character simultaneously. Occasional phrases (“weight of a swallowed truth,” “the weight was no longer swallowed”) verge on repetition or mild purple, and the final explanatory blocks lean more on telling than the rest. Still, there are few true artifacts, and the action reads smoothly with clear sequencing. Tightening a handful of redundant formulations and trusting implication more at the end would sharpen the line-level further.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is clean and mostly concise, with clear syntax, few if any grammatical slips, and sentences that reliably advance mood or idea. The prose sustains a steady, readable cadence, and key images (moss on shelves, obsidian reflections, folds of the swan) function effectively. Nonetheless, there is noticeable repetition of concepts and phrasing without added pressure, and abstract noun strings occasionally replace more specific or surprising turns of phrase, modestly dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to parse, with a clear chronological throughline. However, it leans heavily on repeated phrases and conceptual labels instead of fresh concrete image-work, leading to a sense of sameness at the line level. Many adjacent sentences restate similar ideas about magic, wonder, and motivation, which flattens momentum. The eclipse scene in particular is summarized rather than rendered with sensory specificity, dulling what should be the most vivid beat.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with high information density and few outright clunkers. That said, it leans toward overstatement and repetition (“bronze quiet” and similar constructions recur, and revelations are often rephrased rather than advanced), creating a mild sense of thematic and syntactic looping. Several key beats are summarized in abstract terms instead of being rendered in concrete sensory shifts, which lessens impact. This is solid, publishable line work with some purple edges and redundancy that would benefit from tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, but it leans heavily on repetition and summary, creating a flat rhythm. Many sentences restate similar ideas (“orchestrated,” “directing the flow,” “transpose her life into a new key”) without adding new pressure or image. There’s little concrete, sensory specificity; most lines do single, declarative work rather than layering action, mood, and character. This keeps momentum adequate but prevents lines from feeling sharp or indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong, controlled images (“a stain of pure concept”) and good information density at the line level. However, metaphor density is high and often circles similar terrain (“unraveled stillness,” “decorated with silence,” “muffled clarity”), creating a mild sense of conceptual redundancy. Some sentences restate stakes or method without adding pressure, which slightly blunts momentum in such a short piece. Still, clarity is maintained, and the final beats read cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with clear, imagistic sentences that carry both atmosphere and interiority; images like the lake cracking as a bass note are memorable and apt. There is noticeable repetition of structures and near-duplicate ideas (“Before exhaustion hit… Exhaustion loomed,” recurring formulations of mapping and connecting memories), which creates a slightly list-like cadence. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; it rarely tips into muddle, though some metaphors (e.g., “upturned hush”) are more aesthetic than clarifying. Tightening redundancy and varying sentence rhythms could sharpen momentum to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentences are grammatically clean with generally clear sequencing and a readable cadence; there are few outright line-level errors. However, there is noticeable scaffold and repetition (“He had to…”, “He needed to…”, multiple similar formulations of the same inner journey) and some abstract phrasing that could be distilled into more vivid, concrete images. Figurative language is restrained enough that it doesn’t turn purple, but several lines tell what surrounding sentences already imply, slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, compressed, and often do double duty with image and emotional movement. Motifs (rustle of seasons, filament of hush, mirrored hush) recur with purpose rather than as empty echo, and there’s little true scaffolding or synonym-churn. A few formulations verge on purple or explanatory (“This audibly muted performance was not empty but full”), lightly dulling impact by telling what the images already show. Rhythm and clarity at the closure beat remain intact, so these are minor rather than structural issues.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence-level craft is clean and generally concise, with a smooth rhythm and clear sequencing; there are no major grammatical or syntactic issues. Several key phrases (“layered tranquility,” “to nurture integrity,” “credibly curious,” “progressing laterally”) recur in a way that feels prompt-driven and slightly mechanical rather than organically thematic. The ending leans on expository summary (“The rogue quarantine zone was eventually unmasked…”) instead of dramatized consequence, dulling impact. Information density is decent, but there’s room to cut repetition and dramatize rather than tell in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with several strong lines (“cathedral of glass and ghostly leaves,” “bridges to love and loss”). Most sentences do at least two jobs—advancing mood and concept together—and there are no glaring grammatical issues or confusing constructions. The main weakness is mild overstatement and repetition near the end, where concepts like “impact of memories” and the answer to her question are summarized a bit too directly. Tightening those redundancies would sharpen momentum and leave the final image more haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, mostly concise, and each tends to carry multiple functions (image, theme, and character together). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent; images like “each thread a possibility, each knot a consequence” extend established metaphors rather than mixing them. There is some repetition of conceptual language around time and pattern that nudges toward abstraction, and a couple of lines (“his poet's heart beating with a passionate subtlety”) tell a bit more than they embody. Overall, momentum holds, and the closure image is clear and undulled by purple prose or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and readable, with some striking images (the bowl pulsing with “the life of countless stories,” the orchard as metaphor for persistence). There is, however, notable redundancy in both ideas and phrasing—multiple sentences reiterate the same insight about unfinished beauty or hush without adding pressure or new texture. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; it skirts purple in places yet does not collapse clarity. Line-level craft is solid but not razor-honed to elite-magazine tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    The language is generally clean and rhythmic, with some strong, precise images (amber light pulsing, static as emotional residue). However, there is noticeable repetition and scaffolding: “as the transformation completed” appears multiple times, and similar realizations about authenticity and half-truths are restated in slightly different words. Abstract, multi-noun phrases (“affectionate detachment,” “emerging authenticity,” “genuine emotional insights”) accumulate, edging toward conceptual clutter rather than concrete evocation. The line-level craft is competent and readable but not as taut, surprising, or economical as top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is clear and competent, but it leans heavily on summary and repeated phrasing (“cycles of compassion,” “breezy library under the stars,” “cautious exuberance”) that creates a looped, slightly slogan-like feel. Many sentences do similar work in slightly different words, reducing information density and momentum. There is little vivid, scene-level imagery or textured sensory detail to anchor key emotional beats. While free of major errors, the line-level craft lacks compression, surprise, and sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with some strong images and efficient paragraphing. There is a tendency toward repetition and abstraction in key beats—especially near the end, where phrases like “webs of kinship,” “luminescent ache,” and “shared journey” recur and verge on purple. Still, sentences usually carry more than one function (setting plus emotion, or theme plus action) and do not significantly stall momentum. Line-level craft is competent and occasionally vivid, but not yet razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is clean: sentences are grammatical, largely concise, and the rhythm alternates short and long lines in a way that carries the reader smoothly. Information density is decent, with many sentences doing double duty (world + mood, or action + theme). There is some mild redundancy and patterning (“rooftop canal system weaving between towers” recurs; several sentences open with “She”), but it doesn’t seriously drag momentum or blur meaning. Figurative language is restrained and coherent, though the final third shades into slightly list-like summation rather than razor-sharp images.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and readable, with clear syntax and a steady rhythmic cadence; nothing crucial is obscured. There is some conceptual and lexical repetition (“gently inventive,” “ambiguous loss,” “dovetail”) and a tendency toward mildly purple abstractions (“calculus of the heart,” “mathematics of emotion was infinite, and that was its beauty”) that don’t always add new information. Still, sentences typically do at least one solid job (advancing action, mood, or theme), and there are few true scaffolding lines or incoherent metaphors. Sharpening redundancy and letting concrete images carry more weight would materially elevate the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and rhythmically smooth, with a consistent lyrical register that doesn’t collapse under pressure. There is some redundancy and mild purple (“sapphire hush” reappears so often it loses force; “kindly methodical” is repeated as a label rather than freshly dramatized), but not enough to obscure meaning or momentum. Sentences usually pull double duty—advancing action while maintaining atmosphere—and there are few obvious scaffolding lines. The language is solidly publishable but would benefit from tightening and a sharper eye for repetition at this elite bar.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is mostly clean, readable, and rhythmically varied, with occasional strong images like the moss that “didn't fight the rain but absorbed it.” There is some redundancy and abstraction (“sustaining transformation,” “reconstruction of her philosophy,” “ongoing journey”) that could be compressed or made more concrete. Figurative language stays within bounds, though the piece sometimes tells what’s already implied, slightly sapping momentum. Line-level craft is solidly publishable but not razor-tight for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is clean, with clear sequencing and a good mix of image and action; most sentences carry multiple jobs (world, emotion, and theme) without feeling bloated. Phrases like “haggard awe” and “water had become both a ghost and a guide” are vivid without tipping into purple. The main weakness is some conceptual repetition—his need to “thresh meaning from experience” and the lesson about connection are reiterated rather than fully entrusted to scene and image. Still, there are no serious artifacts, loops, or muddled metaphors dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and generally well-paced, with few outright redundancies; the piece reads smoothly. Some repetition of phrasing (“steadily unpredictable,” “magnify everyday magic,” “bright darkness”) edges toward slogan rather than fresh image. The prose leans into abstraction at times (e.g., “a testament to the balance between knowing and mystery, control and chaos”) where a concrete beat could carry more weight. Overall, the line-level work is solid and readable but not especially compressed or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is clean, with varied sentence structures and a good balance of concrete imagery and summary. Phrases like “pale structures dripping with the recent rain” and “a shard of memory waiting to be fitted into a whole” show controlled, purposeful lyricism. There is some mild redundancy and telling (“To hearten them, she revealed…”) that slightly flattens moments that could be dramatized more. Overall, the prose flows well and rarely snags, even if it doesn’t quite achieve a strikingly singular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is smooth and readable with a few pleasing phrases, and sentences generally do at least one job each without major syntactic clutter. That said, there is clear repetition and abstraction—variations on “trembling certainty,” “fortress of unspoken truths,” “new start,” and “redemption” recur without adding new texture. Some paragraphs, especially at the end, paraphrase the same transformation several times in slightly different language, softening impact. Figurative language stays within bounds but skews toward familiar mystical clichés rather than sharply original images.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and vivid, with strong sensory choices like “salt-laced wind” and “whales’ haunting calls.” Yet key phrases and concepts recur in near-identical form—“unheard symphony,” “sculpting space for reflection,” “entangled memories,” “patterns” and “peace”—creating mild paraphrase loops and a sense of thematic redundancy in the final third. Figurative language is mostly controlled, but the density of similar metaphors toward the end nudges into slight overwriting. Despite this, clarity and momentum are maintained, and there are no serious grammatical or syntactic faults.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and rhythmic, with vivid metaphors and no grammatical distractions, and many sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding + mood + action). Yet the prose edges into purple: figurative language is dense and often repetitive (“hushed thunder,” “spatial mutiny,” iterations of “prismatic light” and “magnetic fields”), and several adjacent sentences restate similar concepts with slight variation. This ornamental layering dilutes momentum in what is otherwise a high-pressure scene. Trimming synonym loops and tightening a few overlong constructions would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and readable with decent rhythm, and many lines carry multiple functions (character + theme + atmosphere). However, there is noticeable repetition of conceptual vocabulary (fair trade, equations, rigidity/liquefy, honesty) and some abstract, essay-like sentences that could be sharper in image. Several late lines paraphrase the same insight in different words, diluting impact and slowing momentum. The language edges toward purple in places but never fully obscures clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often graceful, balancing description and interiority without major clutter or confusion. Some lines feel redundant or declarative (“His earnestly studious nature demanded nothing less than perfection in this sacred task”), telling what the scene already implies. Still, information density is good, metaphors are coherent, and the final cadence lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally lean and purposeful, with strong rhythm and clear syntax; most sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, character). Recurrent metaphors (labyrinth, layering, tides) are coherent rather than mixed, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym-churn. There is some conceptual repetition (“layered potential,” “layer these fragments”) and summary phrasing that slightly flattens momentum in the middle span. Nonetheless, clarity and cadence remain high, and the closing lines land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clear, mostly concise, and rhythmically steady; description and action generally pull in the same direction. Recurrent phrases and constructions (“resonant hums,” “gloomy cheerfulness,” several sentences beginning “She…”) create mild monotony and a faint sense of scaffold. A few lines veer into cliché or summary (“every end is a new beginning,” “lullaby for the soul”), dulling the closure image’s sharpness. Nonetheless, grammar and sequencing are clean, and there are no major figurative muddles or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied rhythms, clean syntax, and purposeful repetition (e.g., the return of “hopeful desperation” and the chip) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character, and there’s little wasted motion. A few phrases feel somewhat generic or summary (“tangible link to the past,” “silent war of symbols”), keeping it shy of the highest band. Overall the prose supports momentum and mood effectively without veering into purple.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally elegant and clear, with strong information density—many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. There is some tendency toward repetition and faint purple (“dawning hush,” “purposefully curious,” “outlast the bitter cold and crushing loneliness”) that could be tightened without loss. Syntax and grammar are clean, and the final paragraph lands with a precise, resonant image rather than explanation. A bit more variation in texture and a touch less reiteration of already-established sentiments would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, and sentences usually pull their weight for both scene-setting and mood. There is some repetition of concepts (“decode the feedback into direction,” “hub of meaning and direction”) and a few stock images that could be sharpened. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and rhythm remains readable if somewhat uniform. Line-level craft is competent and occasionally evocative, but not yet at the compression and freshness standard of elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and generally concise, with imagery (condensation as coded map, “geothermal heart beating beneath the frost”) doing multiple jobs. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; sentences advance either atmosphere, character, or plot in most cases. A few phrases flirt with abstraction or mild redundancy (“singular convergence,” “primordial pulse”) but don’t significantly blur sense or slow momentum. Line-level craft is strong, though not yet at the startlingly precise or compressed level of top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and free of obvious grammatical or logical errors. Many sentences do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and action, and the read-aloud cadence is pleasant. That said, there is noticeable scaffolding and repetition in structure and concept (“shared balance,” “infinite patience,” rhythmic walking) that could be trimmed for greater impact. The lack of sharper variation in rhythm near the climax slightly dulls the ending’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and fluent, with no major grammatical or clarity issues and a good sense of rhythm. Some sentences carry multiple jobs efficiently (action, atmosphere, and theme in the hush-capture sequence). There is mild redundancy and slogan-like repetition (“lonesome splendor,” “gathered hush,” “as time ran short”) and a tendency to restate earned ideas in slightly different words, which slightly blunts momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is controlled and musical, with strong sentence variety and dense images that generally multi-task (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme in one line). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent; motifs like “lattice,” “hush,” and “copperlight” recur with evolving meaning rather than as decorative churn. There is some abstract phrasing (“the attribute of this place, which sustained impossibilities”) and mild purple edges, but they don’t seriously obscure sense or momentum. No major loops, template cadences, or grammatical slips undercut the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentences are clear and mostly economical, with smooth rhythm and no major grammatical or logical missteps. There is some scaffold and repetition—phrases like “debt across lifetimes,” “lovingly venomous,” and explanatory lines about the bead’s function repeat the same idea. The prose favors statement over implication at key beats (“It would serve as a reminder… a symbol of redemption”), which slightly dulls the closure image. Strong baseline craft, but trimming redundancies and trusting images more would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and largely free of grammatical or syntactic errors, and many lines do double duty for mood and information (“The red canyon walls seemed to breathe, their color deepening with renewed life”). There is some repetition of concepts and constructions (ruin/reverence, haunting optimism, orchid solace, overlapping paths) that veers close to paraphrase looping without quite stalling momentum. Figurative language is generally coherent and not overstacked, though several abstractions could be sharpened into more concrete, sensory images. Overall rhythm reads smoothly aloud but could benefit from more varied sentence architecture at key pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and usually efficient, with some graceful lines (“Fitting them together was like piecing together a prayer”). There is noticeable repetition of key terms and constructions (“purposeful wandering,” “cautious enchantment,” “interrupted journeys”) and occasional summary-style phrasing that could be tightened. Figurative language is generally apt and not overstacked, and action is easy to follow. The line-level craft is solid and publishable with editing, though not yet distinctive or ruthlessly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly concise, with clear sequencing and no major muddles in imagery. Many sentences pull double duty for setting and character, and there’s a pleasant, steady cadence appropriate to a quiet scene. However, there is noticeable redundancy in idea and diction (e.g., repeated emphasis on juxtaposition, nostalgia, and her careful methods) that could be cut or varied for higher density. The lack of sharper syntactic modulation at key beats also keeps the line-level craft from feeling truly sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, varied in rhythm, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for mood and meaning. The recurring metaphors of threads, tapestries, and stars are coherent and not excessively stacked, though “echoed silence” and a few similar phrases risk mild repetition. There’s little in the way of scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and the final line lands with a clean, effective image. Trimming one or two slightly redundant explanatory phrases would further sharpen momentum in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, purposeful, and image-dense without major confusion, and there are no obvious scaffolds or syntactic glitches. Recurrent motifs (unsent letters, fierce tenderness, healing shard) are mostly functional rather than redundant, and transitions between beats are smooth. The prose does flirt with purple at times, and some formulations recur in near-synonym form (“healing energy,” “healing moonlight”) without adding new pressure. These are refinements, though, not structural impediments to momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and musical, with varied syntax and purposeful imagery that usually does more than one job (e.g., the brain coral as both tactile object and memory map). Metaphors are generally apt and non-muddled, and there is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few phrases (“lotus-hearted ache,” “syntax for healing”) flirt with abstraction and could be grounded a touch more in sensory or situational specifics, but they do not obscure meaning. Overall, line-level craft supports momentum in a quiet, lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythms, clear syntax, and a good ratio of image to information. Metaphors (fog as blanket/prison/canvas, fragment as exposed film) are consistent rather than muddled. There is some mild overwriting and repetition near the end, where similar emotional conclusions are restated across several sentences, slightly softening momentum and the punch of the final image. Still, line-level craft is solidly above-average and never obscures sense or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally smooth, grammatical, and readable, with some striking images (melodies blooming into visible patterns, floral echoes pulsing with light). There is minor redundancy and abstraction—phrases like “enchantment of reflected mysteries” and repeated references to awakenings and curiosity add haze rather than new information. Figurative density is moderately high but not incoherent, and cause/effect remains clear throughout. Tightening repetition and trimming a few abstracted lines would significantly sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence-level writing is clean and readable, with a mostly smooth rhythm and clear sequencing of action. There are some strong images and phrases, but also a few repeated concepts and formulations (“spark of defiance,” “converging chaos,” tax tech/warping) that edge toward mild redundancy. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to blur sense, and there are no major logical or grammatical slips. Tighter pruning of repeated motifs and slightly sharper verb choices could heighten momentum and distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid metaphors and a clear rhythmic sense; many lines carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, theme). However, there is notable redundancy and phrase-looping—several key constructions (“shyly unstoppable,” “core concept of blossom armistice,” “off-key wind,” “photosynthesize pain into beauty”) recur in near-identical form without always adding new pressure. At times, abstract nouns pile up where a more concrete gesture would sharpen impact. The language is good enough for serious consideration but could be line-edited for concision and variety before elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level prose is polished and clear, with varied sentence structures and few, if any, grammatical slips. Imagery is often striking (“sea of frozen milk,” “museum of extinct feelings”), though figurative density borders on purple in places. There is some conceptual repetition and ornamental phrasing, but it does not materially slow momentum or obscure action. Overall, the prose is above-average and publication-ready with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and purposeful, with good integration of description, interiority, and action. Some phrases verge on purple or repetitive (“symphonies of truth,” “unsnarl the tangled web”) and thematic terms are reused as labels rather than freshly dramatized. Still, sentence rhythm varies, there’s little true scaffolding or synonym churn, and the final image (ink well overflowing, harmony audible, door opening) is clear and effective. Line-level craft is strong but not yet at the razor-honed precision of top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are mostly lean yet musical, with good syntactic variety and a strong sense of rhythm; key images (the chain’s clink, ash drifting, the softer breath) carry multiple layers of meaning. A few lines lapse into slightly purple or redundant phrasing, particularly in the thematic summation of the ending. Nonetheless, clarity remains high, and most sentences perform more than one job (setting, emotion, and theme intertwined). There are no major artifacts, loops, or figurative muddles that obscure action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, with recurring images (dust motes, skylight, paper, pigeons) providing some cohesion and music. Sentences generally pull their weight, though there is a tendency toward scaffold-like openings (“The attic…,” “The paper trails…,” “In the end…”) and a few near-platitudinous lines. Figurative language is moderate and mostly coherent, avoiding purple excess. The main craft limitation is a reliance on telling and summary rather than scene-based texture, which keeps momentum smooth but emotionally muted.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level writing is generally smooth and rhythmic, with strong images (e.g., wood grain “like frozen rivers”) and clean syntax. That said, there is substantial repetition of ideas—necessary distances, sacred thresholds, being lost vs. found—often paraphrased across adjacent sentences, which introduces a sense of redundancy. Figurative language verges on purple in places and can blunt impact by explaining what images have already implied. Overall, the prose is competent and occasionally striking but could be tightened and de-abstracted to heighten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with a steady rhythm and some effective images (the burnt feather, underwater fireflies, star charts across the glass). There is a tendency toward repetition and paraphrase at the conceptual level—variations on isolation, wonder, connection, and belonging recur without always adding new texture. Figurative language generally remains controlled, but a few phrases veer into sentimental or vague territory, softening impact. Momentum is adequate for a quiet piece, though the line-level could be tightened for higher density.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear, rhythmic, and free of syntactic confusion, with some nice images (the golden helix of hope, emotional imprints like footprints). There is mild repetition (“cheerful gloom” recurs; some emotions are labeled rather than embodied) and a tendency toward conceptual rather than concrete phrasing, but it doesn’t seriously obscure sense or drag momentum. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to feel purple. For elite venues, tighter pruning of redundancies and more textural specificity would be needed.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally fluent and image-rich, with several strong lines (e.g., rose petals as “crimson snow under the starlight”). There is some repetition of concepts (ordering randomness, orchestrated serendipity, quiet revolution) and a tendency toward stacked, high-flown modifiers that edge into mild purple prose. A few sentences restate ideas with slightly different wording, which could be trimmed for greater punch. Nonetheless, rhythm, clarity, and syntactic variety hold up, and no line-level issues damage the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is largely clean and readable, with few syntactic or grammatical slips, and many images are striking on their own. Nonetheless, there is significant purple-prose density and repetition of concept (“obsidian grace,” “verse,” “tide dancer,” “nostalgia ban,” “exile”) without corresponding new pressure, which softens momentum. Several sentences do nearly the same atmospheric job in sequence, suggesting room for tightening and more varied texture.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences are well-shaped, sensory, and purposeful, with good syntactic variety and momentum for a reflective piece. There are occasional redundancies and abstract formulations (“language of consequence and connection,” “cathedral of clear complexity”) that flirt with purple or conceptual vagueness. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent, with glass/light/water imagery forming a consistent symbolic cluster. Tightening some of the explanatory lines and letting images stand a bit more on their own would lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and generally readable, and some lines have a pleasing cadence. Yet there is notable repetition and paraphrase-looping around key phrases (“during the slow dance of celestial bodies,” “gently skilled,” “hard softness,” “translate pain into a universal language,” “reflecting deeply”), which dulls impact. Figurative language tends to be stacked rather than pruned, producing mild purple-prose drag. Line-level craft is competent but not ruthlessly compressed or surprising enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and mostly economical, with strong sensory images (tide-polished grotto, balloon orbs, blue sea glass net) doing double duty for mood and concept. There’s some risk of mild purple or conceptual repetition (hope, equations, patterns) but it rarely feels redundant or muddled. Sentences flow cleanly, with clear grammar and sequencing, and most lines advance either atmosphere or idea. It could benefit from a touch more textural variation or surprise at the line level to reach elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and mostly fluent, with solid rhythm and a good balance of description and movement. At times, it drifts into redundancy and abstraction (“weight of legacy,” “burden now, not just as history”) rather than compressing into fresher, more concrete language. The ending paragraphs in particular stack similar sentiments and slightly soften impact through sentimentality. No major syntactic or clarity issues, but line-level tightening could significantly heighten intensity and distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, with clear syntax, few if any grammatical errors, and strong sensory density that does multiple jobs per sentence. However, there is noticeable repetition in structures and concepts (“perceptive calm,” “grace,” heartbeat as “borrowed,” mirage/possibility) that can read as light paraphrase loops rather than fresh development. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent; still, the near-uniform lyricism risks flattening momentum because intensity doesn’t modulate much as pressure nominally rises. Trimming redundant lines and varying texture around the climax would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound with a steady cadence, and many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and action. There is some redundancy and abstraction (“price of redemption weighed heavily,” “operatively gentle manner disarming their ingrained animosity”) that could be tightened for greater impact. Figurative language around light, webs, and celestial dance is serviceable but leans toward familiar formulations, and key lines explain what images already convey. While not purple, the density of solemn descriptors sometimes dulls momentum rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with clear syntax, solid rhythm, and images that do multiple jobs (e.g., cracks as both veins and map). Line-level craft sometimes tips toward redundancy and overstatement—several sentences reiterate his guilt and the irony of preservation-through-destruction rather than trusting earlier images. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled, and momentum mostly holds despite the reflective mode. Tightening repeated sentiments and a few stock phrases would lift this into a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, with few mechanical issues and a strong ear for cadence and image. At times the density of figurative language and concept phrases (“a symphony of defiance,” “poetry of her being,” “alarming serenity”) slides toward purple and introduces mild redundancy, especially around the lullaby/defiance contrast. Some sentences restate similar ideas (serenity as threat, revolution through gesture) without adding new pressure, which slightly blunts momentum. Nonetheless, clarity of action is maintained and the closure image is not obscured, so the line-level debt is modest rather than disqualifying.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft is clean and grammatical, with occasional striking images (whispers echoing “like meteors streaking past”). However, there is noticeable redundancy and paraphrase-looping, especially around central motifs (ethical storytelling, reversal, meteor hush, half-lit epiphanies) that are restated without new pressure. The prose leans toward purple at times, layering modifiers and abstract nouns instead of tightening into concrete action. Momentum suffers slightly in the middle as similar ideas are revisited in similar language.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong rhythm and well-chosen images that carry both atmosphere and meaning. There is some repetition and mild purple drift (e.g., “blushing stillness,” “sacred space,” “unspoken reverence”) that could be tightened without loss, and a few phrases restate the same sentiment in slightly different words. Nevertheless, syntax remains clear, the narrative flows smoothly, and key images (the shimmer of the wing, the arch’s brief glow, the butterfly’s weary orbit) land cleanly. Line-level craft is solidly above-average but not yet at the ruthless precision of top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with strong images like “holes like tiny windows” in the punched card and “a lattice of luminescent remembrance” in the rope. Line-level clarity is maintained throughout, and sentences usually carry more than one function (worldbuilding plus emotion, or action plus symbolism). However, figurative language is dense and often stacked, creating moments of purple-leaning abstraction (“snowmelt ardor,” “cradle of rediscovery,” “sanctuary of sonorous light”) that soften impact rather than sharpen it. Some phrasing and concepts are repeated without escalating nuance, slightly dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished, with few outright clumsy lines, and it sustains a lyrical mood while maintaining basic clarity. Yet it overrelies on similar abstract constructions (“ultimate freedom,” “grand, ethereal song,” “lived truth woven into the wind”), resulting in a mild sense of synonym churn and thematic repetition in the final third. Some sentences do redundant work by rephrasing the same insight rather than advancing image or pressure. Line-level craft is strong but somewhat overwritten in places for top-tier literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and imagistic, with strong sentences like “symbols rising from the floor like golden smoke, forming equations of adoration.” There is some redundancy and abstraction, such as repeated use of “dusky harmony” and “encrypted devotion,” and the closing paragraphs lean into summary and explicit statement. Imagery stays coherent, but certain phrases feel slightly purple or mechanical, clearly derived from required elements rather than organic necessity. Line-level craft is solid and readable, but would need tightening and a bit more restraint to reach elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, and sentences usually advance either concept or narrative. That said, there’s frequent abstraction and repetition (“shifting grace,” “cellular memory,” “resentment”) without added nuance, and several metaphors are familiar or expository rather than vivid. Many lines tell what symbols mean instead of letting them work on their own, which dulls momentum. Rhythm is serviceable but not especially varied or charged at emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and rhythmically even, with some nicely crafted images (“branches like brittle bones,” “diamond-like sparks across the fog”). There is some redundancy in phrasing and concept (“erased the boundaries,” “firmly grounded,” and reiterations of capturing the dream) that could be tightened for greater impact. Figurative language stays coherent and avoids purple excess, though it leans heavily on visual description. Overall momentum is maintained, but the line-level could do more multi-tasking and employ greater syntactic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level craft is clean and mostly concise, with clear syntax and a few strong phrases that efficiently carry both image and theme. There is some repetition and near-synonymous restating of the same idea (vows as seasons, accidental wisdom, persistence) that creates a slight sense of scaffolding and didactic emphasis. Figurative language is generally controlled and coherent, but the closing paragraphs lean on generalized abstractions instead of fresh concrete images, reducing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and vivid yet controlled figurative language. There are occasional redundancies and slightly purple patches (e.g., clusters like “brightened disquiet,” “blooming possibility,” “infinite dance of knowledge”) that risk a soft, generalized feel rather than sharpening specific moments. Still, clarity is never in doubt; cause and effect and spatial relations stay legible, and key images (the cameo in her palm, fruit pulsing, placing it among the roots) land cleanly. Tightening some abstractions and trimming a few modifiers would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and free of significant syntactic or clarity issues, with a few memorable images (“an unheard symphony,” “books floated in mid-air, humming with latent knowledge”). Information density is solid: most sentences carry worldbuilding and motion together without obvious scaffolding or repetition. At times the language drifts toward abstraction (“resonance that only certain knowledge could disrupt,” “align their thoughts with the store’s unseen rhythm”), which slightly blurs sensory immediacy. Overall, line-level craft is publication-ready but not yet at the razor-sharp precision or freshness that would push it into the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear and fluent, with some effective images (the fog like a shroud, rides as skeletons of joy) and clean sequencing. There is a tendency toward abstraction and repetition of key phrases (“narrative threads,” “unkindled solace,” “trapped freedom”) that occasionally feels like conceptual looping rather than fresh progression. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to muddy sense, and grammar/usage are solid. Tightening a few redundant sentences and varying rhythm and imagery would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are clean, grammatical, and generally well-shaped, with a good balance of description and forward motion and few, if any, genuine scaffolding loops. Imagery (“visual static,” “dust motes like tiny stars”) is lucid and apt, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. There is some mild redundancy of phrasing and concept (her “warmly methodical” nature is stated more than once; “confusion into clarity” is echoed), but it doesn’t seriously drag momentum. Line-level craft is strong enough for many markets, though an elite venue would likely demand a sharper, more compressed final polish.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and grammatically clean, with generally clear sequencing and a good sense of rhythm at the paragraph level; many sentences do double duty for setting and mood. There is some synonym and concept looping (e.g., repeated emphasis on luminescence, hush, harmony, resonance) that slightly reduces information density and can feel like reassertion rather than progression. Figurative language is consistent but leans toward the ornate in nearly every line, which risks a uniform tonal hum instead of dynamic emphasis. Strong craft overall, yet not stripped or varied enough to be elite-line-level.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, imagery is generally precise, and most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action). Figurative language (“thistle-blown hope,” “a shard of hush piercing the world”) is vivid and mostly coherent, and there’s little scaffolding or synonym-churn. The prose does flirt with density—metaphor and abstraction appear frequently—but without tipping into confusion or derailing momentum. Trimming a few expository formulations in the final paragraph would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally polished, with clear syntax, purposeful vocabulary, and a strong ear for cadence; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, theme, or character. At times the language leans toward the purple, with layered metaphors and modifiers (“sea of clouds,” “whispers… like steam,” “each whisper a thread in the fabric of his own being”) that risk redundancy. Still, figurative choices are coherent and never truly muddle meaning, and there are few if any scaffold or paraphrase loops. Tightening a handful of abstract or over-decorated lines would bring the piece close to publishable line-level.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally strong, with clear syntax, varied sentence structures, and evocative images like “the sky a vast, empty canvas” and the flame “blooming like a transient flower.” Information density is solid; most sentences carry both atmosphere and character or thematic work. There is some redundancy and abstraction—repeated phrases about “filtering despair,” “gravity of hopelessness,” and “serious play”—and occasional over-explanation of already-implied meaning. Nonetheless, clarity is never in doubt, and the lyricism is controlled enough that it does not blur cause and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, generally concise, and rhythmically varied, with several strong images (the hermit crab changing shells, time as overlapping strata). Information density is good: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is some noticeable repetition of key phrases and ideas (“texture of time,” explicit statements about transitions) that borders on paraphrase looping and mild over-telling. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and purple excess is limited, so the line-level work is solidly above average but not razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion, or concept plus image). Figurative language is controlled and thematically aligned; the repeated “intangibly tangible” and spatial compression/expansion pattern read as deliberate rather than as muddle. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and transitions between beats are clean. At times abstraction slightly outweighs sensory grit, but clarity and momentum remain intact through the climax and closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, with some strong sensory images and no major figurative muddles. That said, there are paraphrase loops and near-identical assertions (“Her motivation was clear…”, restated several times) that do not add new pressure or detail. The repetition of certain terms (“in transit,” “monitoring noise levels,” “vaulting hush”) trends toward scaffolding rather than deliberate patterning. Tightening redundant lines and varying syntax would noticeably sharpen momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, but it leans on repetition and summary (“her mission was clear,” “time was slipping away; she had until sunrise...”) rather than compressed, multi-tasking lines. Modifiers and abstractions (“wisely adventurous spirit,” “latent energy,” “joy of discovery”) dilute immediacy, and several sentences restate information without adding pressure. Figurative language is sparse and safe, and the closure beat explains significance instead of trusting image alone. Line-level craft is serviceable but not yet sharpened to elite standards.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically smooth, with some arresting phrases and a clear aesthetic. However, it relies heavily on abstract nouns and conceptual metaphors (emptiness, thresholds, silence, suffocation) at the expense of concrete, bodily specificity. Certain ideas and constructions recur with minimal added pressure (“burns bridges carefully,” “loaded emptiness,” “fading thresholds”), creating mild redundancy and a sense of overworked motif. The result is atmospheric but verging on purple, with less line-level precision than elite venues demand.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: clear syntax, purposeful description, and good information density without excessive scaffolding. A few phrases drift toward purple or conceptual stacking (“spectrum of shadowseam wonder,” “a quantum promise, a potentiality shimmering with both infinite hope and the threat of collapse”), but they remain understandable. There’s minor redundancy in theme-stating and a tendency to explain metaphors that are already legible. Overall momentum holds, and no figurative muddle or loop significantly dulls the climax or final image.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, but it leans on repetitive structures and phrases (“golden shadows,” “bridge of intuition,” “standing waves”) without deepening each recurrence. Many sentences restate similar ideas (hidden truth, transformation, intuition) in slightly different wording, creating a sense of paraphrase looping. Figurative language tends toward the purple and abstract rather than grounded specifics, which softens impact. Momentum is adequate for a reflective piece, but line-level craft does not yet meet a high-literary bar.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and usually clear, with some strong images (“fruits that were not fruits, but swirling visions of what might be”) and decent sentence-level rhythm. However, it suffers from noticeable repetition and minor overwriting: key phrases and constructs recur with little new information, and abstractions are often stacked where more concrete specificity would serve better. These loops and stock-feeling intensifiers dull momentum and slightly blur the emotional peaks. Tightening redundant lines and varying metaphorical language would significantly sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatically clean, and rhythmically varied enough to read smoothly. Metaphoric language is present but not overstacked, and central images (dust layers, the button, brittle files) carry multiple jobs. Some lines paraphrase or summarize rather than deepen (“Her motivation was simple yet profound: to magnify small kindnesses”), and the research section in particular lapses into flat telling. These issues sap momentum slightly but do not obscure causality or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level writing is grammatically clean and easy to follow, and sentences generally advance either plot or theme. Yet there is palpable redundancy (e.g., multiple near-identical mentions of “holding the line,” “plans unraveling,” “auric lagoon under starlight”), which creates a looped, summary feel instead of momentum. Figurative language is sparse but also fairly stock, and sentence structures repeat enough to dull rhythm. The final third especially leans on abstract restatement rather than fresh, concrete turns of phrase, which undercuts closure’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lines are generally clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, and many sentences carry atmosphere and action together efficiently. However, there is noticeable redundancy: key phrases and concepts (“vested hush,” “quietly vivid,” “eerie nostalgia,” “through negative space”) are repeated without adding new nuance, creating a low-level loop effect. Figurative language is safe rather than surprising—“tiny pearls,” “protective blanket”—and the prose rarely varies its rhythm to mirror shifts in intensity. These issues don’t break clarity, but they do blunt momentum and keep the craft below elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with evocative phrases and an easy rhythm that reads smoothly. However, there is notable repetition of structures and ideas (“emerged transformed always,” “regional folklore,” “mossy delight,” “tiny monuments to forgotten things”) that begins to feel like a loop rather than purposeful incantation. Many sentences tell the same kind of information—summarized transformations and evolving folklore—without adding new pressure or image density, which dulls momentum. The language is pleasant but somewhat over-expository and self-repeating for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatically clean, and rhythmically varied, with some strong images (the waterfall’s mist “painting the air with rainbows,” the synchronized ticks on her return). There is noticeable redundancy and scaffold—repeated restatements of her motivation and realizations, and several sentences that paraphrase each other in the closing stretch. Abstract thematic phrasing occasionally replaces concrete dramatization, slightly dulling momentum. Still, line-level control is above average and never obscures causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (kintsugi, luminous regret, searches as shattered purpose) is coherent and thematically aligned, not overstacked. Prose is dense but not purple, and action sequencing is clear despite the contemplative pace. Minor tendencies toward abstract phrasing in the climax don’t materially blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, and many sentences do double duty for mood and information. Still, there are paraphrase loops and near-duplicates—especially in the latter third where lines restate Elara’s role and method almost verbatim. Abstract phrasing (“luminous ache,” “pain of unresolved lives”) recurs without fresh inflection, blunting impact. Rhythm and syntax are mostly uniform, which limits momentum and musicality for such a lyric-leaning piece.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is largely strong: vivid metaphors, good sensory layering, and sentence rhythms that maintain momentum without clutter. Key images (mask strap, UV light, bracing) recur purposefully rather than as dead loops. There are a few mildly clinical or repetitive phrasings (“Remembering through trauma responses” is repeated verbatim; some abstract restatements of the same inner conflict) that could be trimmed for maximal sharpness. Overall clarity remains high, with little true scaffolding or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level writing is smooth and largely free of grammatical or syntactic errors, with a good balance of description and movement. Metaphors (“like holding a forgotten dream,” “the elusively tangible now solid in her mind”) are mostly coherent and on-theme. There is modest repetition of key phrases and concepts (“between childhood and now,” “anchors of intuition,” “elusively tangible”) that edges toward redundancy without adding new nuance. Overall, the prose is competent and sometimes pleasing, but not yet razor-tight or maximally efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level writing is clean, with good clarity and mostly efficient sentences that advance either mood or story. There is some repetition of ideas in the closing stretch (“weightless burden,” “what ceilings hide,” his purpose), creating a slight sense of paraphrase-loop and softening momentum. A few phrases tilt toward the generic (e.g., “the world was unchanged, but Leo carried a new story within him”). Overall, the prose is solid but short of the density and sharpness expected at a top literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Imagery is vivid (“bottled whisper,” “luminous moment,” “sea of clouds boiled violently”) and usually coherent with the story’s physics of negotiable reality. There is some risk of purple-prose saturation—nearly every sentence carries an image or abstraction—which slightly dulls impact and could be pared for sharper emphasis. Still, momentum remains intact, and the closure image lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    The line-level writing is clean and grammatically sound, with a mostly smooth rhythm and a clear progression from sentence to sentence. Information density is decent, though the story leans on similar abstract formulations (“burnished sorrow,” “poetically inclined mind,” “spaces between facts”) instead of fresh, concrete images. Many crucial beats are handled in compressed exposition rather than dramatized, which blunts immediacy and momentum. Figurative language is controlled but not especially surprising, and there’s mild redundancy in how Elara’s sorrow and mission are described.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally grammatical and clear, with some striking phrases (“fingers, stained with oil and starlight”) and a consistent rhythm that’s easy to follow. At the same time, many sentences perform the same conceptual work with slight variation, and key motifs are repeated rather than deepened, producing a mild sense of scaffolding and redundancy. Figurative density occasionally tips into purple or vague abstraction (“mending metaphysical wounds,” “sympathy of potential”) without adding concrete pressure. The line-level craft is solid but not yet compressed or surprising enough for an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically controlled, and information-dense, with images doing double duty for mood and meaning. Occasional repetition (“resonant hush” twice; similar cadences around awakenings and ineffability) comes close to feeling slightly over-patterned but doesn’t materially drag momentum. Figurative language is present but not stacked to the point of purple; “stone icicles,” “obsidian” water, and the spinning needle are clear and concrete. Overall, the prose flows cleanly with minimal scaffold or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly clear, varied in rhythm, and dense with information that advances atmosphere and character. The prose occasionally tips into mild purple or redundancy—repeating key coined terms, leaning on stacked abstractions—which softens impact rather than sharpening it. Nonetheless, there are few true loops or scaffolding sentences, and closure beats remain crisp and legible. A light pruning of abstract nouns and repeated coined phrases would significantly elevate the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with some striking images (night-blooming flowers intertwined with stars, amber panels filtering fading light). Sentences vary in length and cadence, avoiding mechanical rhythm, and there are few if any grammatical or syntactic slips. However, the story overuses abstract summary verbs (“realized,” “reckoned,” “felt,” “understanding filled her”) where concrete embodiment could carry more weight, and several sentences repeat similar ideas about silence, hush, and tenderness. The line-level craft is solid and publishable with tightening, but not yet sharp enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally concise, with a few strong images (“sheet of black glass,” “the weight of history”). Information density is good: most sentences advance either atmosphere or theme. There is some reliance on abstract formulations and familiar phrases (“profound sense of reverence and responsibility,” “raw and unvarnished”) that slightly flatten otherwise vivid moments. Rhythm is steady but could use more variation or sharpness at the emotional peaks to heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clear, grammatically sound, and free of major artifacts; sentences usually carry multiple functions (world, theme, and character) efficiently. There is some repetition of key phrases (“false comfort,” “through working memory,” “wish”) and a tendency toward similar sentence shapes, but not enough to seriously impede momentum. The piece leans into abstract language at times, yet most figurative touches (ghost town “echoing with memories,” lantern as “forgotten dream”) are coherent and controlled. Line-level work is competent and publishable in many venues, though not exceptional for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatically clean, and free of major artifacts; sentences carry image and information without obvious bloat, and the rhythm is readable. There are some mild repetitions and slightly redundant explanatory lines that could be tightened, especially around restating his purpose and the significance of the prophecy. Figurative language is used sparingly and mostly works, with no serious mixed metaphors or purple excess. Overall it’s solid, workmanlike literary prose with room to sharpen concision and let implication carry more load.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatically clean, and rhythmically smooth, with several strong images (the egg cracking “like fracturing ice,” the portal “rippling like water”). There is some repetition and mild purple tendency—stock intensifiers and mantra-like reuse of “wild serenity,” “furious tranquility,” and “decrease entropy” language—without deepening meaning each time. Most sentences do at least one job, but a few lines paraphrase earlier content (e.g., restating her preparation and motivation) rather than adding pressure. Line-level craft is solid but not sharpened to the density and originality an elite venue would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clear and largely free of errors, but it exhibits notable redundancy and scaffold (“After the glue dried,” “zero hour,” and parallel summary sentences recur with little added nuance). Many lines simply restate prior information or theme, which flattens momentum and emotional charge. Figurative language is sparse and safe, tending toward slogan rather than image. The final third in particular explains rather than distills, dulling the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is smooth and clear but frequently repetitive in both phrasing and concept (“primal elegance,” “overlooked era,” “find strength in vulnerability,” “tracing the path of falling stars”). Many sentences perform similar work—asserting inner states or restating theme—without adding new pressure or concrete image. Figurative density stays moderate, so clarity is rarely lost, but information density could be higher with tighter, more specific lines. There are no glaring grammatical issues, yet the piece skirts toward mild purple abstraction rather than crisp, multi-tasking sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatical, and rhythmically steady, with some strong sensory moments (“scent of honey and dust,” “drifting through the dry air like pale smoke”). There is noticeable redundancy and scaffolding—phrases like “through contextual clues” and “his motivation was clear” summarize what the surrounding sentences already imply. Several sentences flatten momentum by telling what could be shown, especially in thematic statements and labels. Still, there are no major figurative muddles, and most lines do at least one piece of work for story or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose flows smoothly, with good rhythm and relatively high information density given the conceptual load. There are some repetitive constructions and abstract formulations (“anticipated mysteries,” “collective healing,” “new understanding”) that feel slightly generic or summary-like, especially in the back half. Figurative language is generally clear and thematically aligned, though the closing paragraphs edge toward sentimentality and redundancy. No serious syntactic or clarity issues impede momentum or obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished and musical, with strong sensory images and a consistent cadence. There is some repetition and mild purple tilt—phrases like “burnished hush,” “woven dawns,” and explicit thematic lines are reiterated in ways that feel a bit over-explained. A few sentences restate similar ideas about incompleteness and harmonizing discord without adding pressure or new nuance. Still, clarity remains high and most lines are doing more than one job, even if the piece could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, and there are few if any real artifacts or redundancies. Key images—copper spirals, crystalline veins, the hum of the pillars—are handled with clean, concrete language. There is some mild repetition of concepts (“brazen calm,” “gentle, systematic”) and occasional abstract phrasing that could be cut for even greater tautness. Overall momentum holds, but the prose rarely takes risks or achieves the kind of compressive sharpness that would push it into top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, rhythm is varied, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and concept. There is a mild tendency toward lush repetition and stacked modifiers, but it rarely muddies sense or stalls momentum. No major artifacts, loops, or syntactic tics interfere with understanding or weaken the closure image. A slightly leaner calibration—trimming a few near-redundant phrases—would push this closer to elite.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative with some strong lines (“a thin finger of stone holding against the immense, dark ocean”). That said, there is noticeable repetition at the sentence and concept level—key terms and ideas (motivation, bird-call understanding, submerged concord, reclamation of battlefield) are restated multiple times with only minor variation. This creates a mild sense of loop and dilutes momentum in a short piece. Figurative language largely holds together, but it could be pruned and varied to increase density and avoid redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and character, and a pleasing variation in sentence length. Recurring phrases (“wild hush,” “tinted revelation”) read as intentional motifs rather than loops, and figurative language is mostly coherent and grounded in the story’s imagery. There is mild density and a few slightly redundant explanatory lines near the end, but nothing that significantly drags momentum or muddies closure. Overall, the line-level craft is polished and nearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is solid, with mostly clear syntax and some striking phrases, but there is noticeable repetition of concepts (silence, time stretching, purpose) without always adding new pressure. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase each other (“His motivation, sharp and clear amidst the confusion…” later echoed by similar statements), which slightly drags momentum. Figurative language is controlled and not excessively purple, though a few lines verge on abstraction rather than concrete image. Tightening redundancy and trusting implication over restatement would sharpen the prose to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: clear, rhythmic sentences with vivid images (“stars bled together in violet smears,” “needle of ancient ice”) and good information density. Line-level clarity is maintained throughout; action and ritual steps are easy to follow. There is some risk of purple or redundant diction—phrases like “apprentice of wonder,” “sacred playfulness,” and sky descriptors recur in ways that feel slightly ornamental rather than escalating. Still, momentum is not significantly harmed, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, with purposeful repetition in the walking-words motif. However, the prose occasionally borders on purple, with stacked abstractions (“luminous absence,” “unresolved tensions of this between-time,” “benevolently ruthless”) that repeat rather than advance texture. Some conceptual redundancy in the middle slows momentum a touch. Still, grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final sentences land with a clear, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally smooth and readable, with a consistent rhythm and few outright clunkers; sentences often carry both atmosphere and thematic weight. There is some paraphrase and conceptual redundancy (“substituted reality,” “shield but now prison,” “seeding” repeated in near-identical contexts), and abstraction sometimes crowds out concrete embodiment. Phrases like “translating her grief into a map of recovery” and “shape of her truth” verge on therapy-speak or slogan rather than lived sensory experience. The prose is solid and occasionally striking but not yet trimmed or specific enough for top-tier literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and purposeful, with several strong images (the frayed tapestry border, the glow of the final labyrinth). Information density is respectable; most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or plot. There is some repetition of concepts and motifs (“woven hush,” “lull of distant thunder,” the moral of failure-as-teacher) that edges toward redundancy, and the closing paragraph explains what the preceding images already imply. These choices keep the piece from a leaner, sharper line-level impact but do not seriously obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and very few syntactic or clarity issues. Metaphoric language recurs (“forged hush,” “tapestry woven from every broken piece,” “constellation of truths”), but the metaphors are internally consistent and generally avoid muddle. There is some repetition of conceptual phrasing and a mild tendency toward purple abstraction in places, yet momentum is maintained and the closure image is sharp. Line-level craft is strong enough for a high-tier venue, though slight tightening of abstractions could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.5)
    The lines are grammatically clean and mostly clear, with some strong images (bubbles as words of remembrance, golden light seaming fractures) and a steady forward momentum. Yet there is notable redundancy and purple edging: key concepts (kintsugi, quilting, meaning vs oblivion, acid’s corrosion) are reiterated in slightly varied language without always adding new pressure or insight. Metaphors are numerous but not always selective, giving parts of the story a slightly over-decorated feel rather than razor-sharp compression. The final beats remain legible, but line-level tightening and reduction of conceptual echo would be needed for elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly concise, with some nice images and a smooth read-aloud rhythm. There is mild abstraction and redundancy—concepts like “temporary eternity,” peace, and nostalgia get explained in similar terms more than once—where the story could rely more on concrete action. Figurative language is controlled and not over-stacked, but key insights are often delivered in expository sentences rather than compressed into sharper images. Line-level craft is strong and professional, just short of the density and precision of top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and mostly concise, with strong sensory images and clean syntax; sentences tend to do more than one job (setting mood, advancing action, and reflecting interiority). A few phrases verge on purple or abstract (“vibrations of intent,” “screaming tenderness”) and some late lines paraphrase what the scene has shown (“She had done it; she had proven…”), slightly dulling momentum. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent, and there are no major clarity issues or structural artifacts. Minor tightening of repetitive thematic statements could heighten impact without sacrificing the lyric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and rhythmic, with few wasted sentences and no major grammatical or clarity issues; the piece reads smoothly. Key images (the groaning hydraulics, glowing censer foot, hum that “pulls the stars closer”) are vivid without becoming incoherent. There is some paraphrase and phrase repetition (“geography of loss,” “raw solace,” similar sentence cadences) that slightly blunts momentum and freshness. The prose is solid and sometimes striking, but doesn’t consistently achieve maximal compression or figurative surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and free of major artifacts, with some strong images (the terrace orchard clinging to the ravine, the eye humming with inner light). There is minor redundancy and abstraction, particularly around recurring terms like “psychological safety” and “occlude,” but not enough to significantly drag momentum. Syntax and paragraphing support a steady, measured pace, though the crisis beat could use sharper, more concrete language to heighten immediacy. Line-level craft is solid and professional but lacks the distinct, high-compression shimmer of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally smooth and readable, with varied syntax and a solid sense of rhythm; most sentences carry both mood and information. Recurring motifs (mist, dock, Edelweiss, borrowed memories) help build texture without devolving into pure redundancy. There is some purple or over-explicit phrasing and a few paraphrase-like reiterations of the same idea (“softly persistent” unease, “borrowed memories,” isolation reframed), which slightly dulls momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is rarely in doubt, and the closing image is clean despite a bit of explanatory drag around it.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is clean, with smooth syntax, clear sequencing, and purposeful description; there are no glaring grammatical or structural artifacts. Some repetitions (“glimmer,” “lingering promise,” variations on “no longer lonely but resolved”) create a slight sense of scaffolding and mild redundancy. Figurative language is restrained and mostly concrete, avoiding purple patches. Sharpening a few places where phrases restate prior information would increase information density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is clean and mostly concise, with clear sequencing and a good sense of rhythm; there are no major grammatical or syntactic issues, and images like “rivulets of silver light” and “sea of white” are effective. The prose occasionally tips toward abstraction or mild purple—e.g., stacked conceptual phrases about cosmic cycles and “celestial collapse”—and leans on summary in pivotal beats where a bit more dramatized specificity could heighten impact. Some key insights are told twice in close succession (she’s chosen as a vessel, the grotto’s beauty vs. menace) which slightly blunts momentum. Overall it’s solid and publishable with tightening, but not yet line-perfect for top-tier literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally smooth, grammatically clean, and easy to follow, with some strong, memorable phrases and a clear rhythmic cadence. However, abstraction and repetition (“density of presence,” “revalue,” “scientifically romantic”) accumulate, creating mild purple-prose drag and reducing information density. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; still, several sentences restate similar ideas about presence and revaluation instead of advancing them. The line-level craft is solid but not ruthlessly pared or sharp enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, theme) with little filler, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and non-redundant, and the few repeated motifs (“feral nostalgia,” the grave) are clearly purposeful. There are almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and grammar/usage are clean. The only restraint on a higher score is the near-constant metaphoric pressure, which occasionally risks feeling ornamental rather than strictly necessary to escalate the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong opening and closing images, good rhythmic variation, and a number of effective metaphors (time as water, the screw as a tool of beginnings). Information density is decent; most sentences carry atmosphere or theme as well as plot. That said, there is some conceptual repetition and abstraction—phrases like “map the emotional terrain,” “ordinary miracles,” and “humanized their struggles” recur without always adding new texture, edging toward generic lyricism. The language is clear and pleasant but not yet as razor-specific or surprising as elite venues demand.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and mostly clear, with striking images (ink crystallizing into gem-like formations, scars turning into glowing rune-stories) and few technical errors. However, there is noticeable repetition of concepts and phrases—storms, saturated hush, breath, scars becoming stories—without each return adding substantial new pressure or nuance, creating mild paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high enough that some lines feel purple or abstract rather than sharpened to scene needs. Momentum remains intact, but tighter pruning and more varied sentence structures would improve propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and controlled, with strong images and minimal scaffolding; most sentences carry multiple loads (atmosphere + character + worldbuilding). Metaphors are generally precise and on-theme—the record needle, paper ghosts, and the rustle-of-leaves voice all feel earned rather than ornamental. There is some lushness, but it rarely tips into purple or redundancy, and syntax remains clear throughout the ritual and closure beats. A touch more restraint in restating Elara’s creed about imperfect miracles would sharpen the impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, but heavily reliant on repeated formulations and key phrases, which dulls momentum (“resounding hush,” “spiral arbitration,” “wanderingly exact” recur without added nuance). Many sentences essentially restate prior content, and the abstract lexicon often substitutes for concrete image or action. The line-level craft is serviceable but not taut or surprising enough for high-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with some nice lines and coherent metaphors (e.g., seconds as “razor edges” dividing existence). There is noticeable repetition and paraphrase (“It was eminently peculiar,” multiple squinting beats, reiterating what clocks measure in slightly varied abstractions), which slightly blunts momentum. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, though some thematic sentences tell what the surrounding images already imply. Line-level craft is solid but not yet taut or economical enough to feel fully publication-ready under a very demanding standard.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and often striking, particularly in its opening and environmental description. There is some repetition and conceptual redundancy (e.g., multiple restatements of the same insight about “letting go” and the repeated “quiet wildfire” image) that slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language rarely becomes incoherent, but the accumulation of abstractions in the latter third softens the impact of the climax. Overall, line-level work is above average but not razor-honed for maximum density and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with some graceful sentences and recurring images that carry weight. Yet there is noticeable repetition and scaffolding—phrases like “clover melancholy,” “lucid contradictions,” and “traverse the city” recur enough to feel slightly programmatic. Several sentences paraphrase or re-summarize insights already given, producing a mild sense of thematic and verbal looping. Figurative language is mostly coherent but leans toward the purple and expository in key beats, which dampens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically controlled, and rich in concrete images like the disc “coiled like a sleeping serpent” and the tunnel’s dim light. There are some paraphrase-like explanations (“This was the method: through wrong number friendships…”) and repeated thematic formulations that could be tightened without loss. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not so dense as to obscure meaning. Overall momentum holds, though the occasional explanatory sentence momentarily stalls the lyric flow.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is mostly clean and rhythmic, with strong, concrete images (“petals glowing in the dusky light,” “the walnut ink dark and permanent”) and minimal grammatical noise. Information density is decent, and description generally advances mood and meaning. However, there is noticeable repetition of concepts and key phrases (“haunted euphoria,” “context had changed,” “weight of small moments”) without escalating nuance, edging toward mild redundancy. The piece is well-crafted but could be tightened and de-abstracted to reach elite line-level sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density: most sentences do double duty in advancing atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but generally clean and unified around silence, decay, and connection, avoiding mixed metaphors or glaring purple patches. There are mild tendencies toward abstraction (“a catalysis of emotion he could not name”) that could be sharpened into more embodied detail, but they don’t significantly drag momentum. Syntax varies and reads smoothly aloud, with no obvious scaffolding or repetition artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense but generally efficient: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly coherent and aligned to the sensory logic of the world (sound/vibration, cartography, constellations). A demanding line edit could pare a few near-redundant phrases and slightly purple turns, but clarity and momentum are not materially harmed. The final image lands cleanly without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally lean yet textured, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology; there are no major loops, template cadences, or figurative muddles. Recurring phrases and images (unbending, crooked/twisted stories, seeds) create cohesion rather than redundancy. A few lines lean on conceptual abstraction (“vast, indifferent context of cosmic noise,” “cascade of relational truth”) where a slightly more concrete inflection might sharpen impact. Overall, rhythm and clarity are strong and easily at or near elite-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally smooth and readable, with a clear throughline and no major syntactic or logical snags; sentences often do double duty for mood and information. There is some overreliance on familiar poetic constructions (“liquid silver,” “radiant embrace,” “timeless harmony”) and abstract nouns (“profound connection,” “joyful sorrow”) that could be sharpened into fresher, more concrete images. Repetitions of similar concepts (“mapping the silence,” “translating silence,” “symphony woven within”) occasionally feel redundant rather than intensifying. Still, momentum holds and the closing image is legible and emotionally alive.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, with a smooth read and occasional striking images (the marred self-portrait as a map; the tapestry in the shaft of light). There is noticeable repetition of key phrases and concepts (“volcanic tenderness,” reiterations of his past arson and new mission) that sometimes read as paraphrase rather than deepening. Abstract nouns and summary (“repositories of knowledge,” “grand narratives,” “comprehensive guide”) dilute immediacy, and line-level work rarely compresses multiple functions with real precision. The writing is solid but carries some purple and expository weight that would need tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clear and often striking at the image level (“sound wave garden,” “auric lagoon,” “entangled memories”), with a readable rhythm. Yet there is noticeable scaffold and paraphrase looping (“Her motivation was…,” “She had breathed life into a shared dream…”) and repeated sentence frames that reduce momentum. Figurative language leans toward the abstract and generalized, sometimes stacking similar sentiments without adding new pressure. These issues keep the line work from the tight economy and variety expected at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, largely free of scaffolding or loops, and maintains good momentum; most lines carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme together). Imagery like “the geomagnetic storm's emerald pulses” and “the labyrinth's heart” is vivid but not so dense as to obscure clarity. There is a slight tendency toward repetition of the central maxim and overt metaphor explanation, which flattens some of the lyric potential. Sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and action is sequenced clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level work is polished and rhythmic, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. At times the prose edges into purple, with layered modifiers and repeated metaphor families that don’t always add new information (“spiralingly calm,” “stillwater tension,” several near-synonymous restatements of the same idea). Nevertheless, clarity holds, and the closure image is not obscured. Trimming redundancy would sharpen momentum without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are generally clean and readable, with only occasional drift into purple repetition (“amplified quiet,” “forests of second thoughts,” “tapestry of change”). Information density is decent, though the latter half leans on summary paragraphs that flatten momentum. Metaphors are mostly coherent, if sometimes familiar, and there are no serious clarity issues or visible scaffolds. The line-level work is solid but not sharp or compressed enough for elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory choices (“dark, wet stones,” “shimmering air,” “bone in her hand was a literal key turning”). Most sentences do multiple jobs—setting tone, revealing character, and advancing action—without obvious loops or scaffolding. There are moments of near-purple abstraction (“combative tenderness,” “monotonous, safe world”) and repeated conceptual phrasing around “true nature” and guarded hearts, but they don’t seriously impede momentum or clarity. Overall line-level control is strong, if slightly decorous for an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level writing is generally strong, with concrete images (wood curls, brittle petals, turbine shadows) doing thematic and atmospheric work. Some metaphors are memorable, but a few (“map of loss,” repeated “remade hush,” “morally ambiguous” labels) feel reused or slightly on-the-nose. There’s mild repetition of concepts and phrasing that could be pared to sharpen momentum. Rhythm and clarity remain intact, but the density of similar figurative moves keeps this from top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level craft is largely strong: sentences are grammatically clean, images are vivid, and there’s a pleasing cadence to the paragraphs. The piece efficiently maintains momentum despite being almost entirely interior and atmospheric. That said, there are paraphrase loops and near-duplicates (“He continued to paraphrase…”, “Here, he composed a new verse, paraphrasing the old…”) and recurring formulations about dissolving boundaries that add a faint sense of redundancy. Some metaphoric phrases verge on purple or abstract without adding new information, suggesting room for tightening and variation.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with some nicely turned images (e.g., the cracked glass catching light, the reed’s soft hum) and efficient scene progression. Information density is decent, but the closing paragraphs circle the same insight with similar constructions, creating mild redundancy and sapping momentum. Figurative language is restrained enough to avoid purple-prose penalties, yet the line-level texture is more solid than striking. With some tightening of repetitive thematic statements, the piece would read much sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant and vivid, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“its prism-song unfolding like a visible ribbon of color and tone”). Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and on-theme; there are few to no mixed metaphors. Some phrases and concepts recur a bit too often (“texture of connection,” “powerfully gentle,” “golden shadows”), creating a faint sense of mantra-like repetition. Tightening these redundancies would sharpen momentum and prevent the lyricism from edging toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and readable, and the overall rhythm is smooth, with some strong images (silver petals falling into gemstone buds, starlight illuminating the stencil). There is noticeable redundancy and scaffold—ideas about cycles, blooming, and intention are restated in slightly different language across multiple lines without adding new pressure or nuance. Figurative language occasionally drifts toward the generic inspirational register, especially in the closing third, dulling the impact of otherwise good motifs. Line-level craft is competent but not razor-honed; several paragraphs could be tightened without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.7)
    Line-level writing is clean, grammatical, and mostly clear, with some appealing images like the onyx ink “drinking” the dim light and rain “merging into streams, like the paths she visualized.” However, there is significant conceptual redundancy: multiple sentences reiterate her motivation, method, and the post-crash context with minor variations, which blunts momentum and information density. Several metaphors (“measuring tape became a metaphor,” “stretching across time,” “launchpad for rebirth”) state their own symbolic function instead of letting the image work, leading to a faintly didactic texture. Trimming paraphrase loops and trusting image over explanation would markedly sharpen the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, and many lines do multiple jobs (setting tone, conveying action, signaling theme). However, there is noticeable repetition at the conceptual level—“forbidden knowledge,” “anguished joy,” “end of innocence,” “purified nostalgia”—without added nuance, and several sentences restate stakes already given. The diction leans abstract and occasionally purple, with a high density of solemn modifiers that flattens impact over time. The line-level work is solid and serviceable but not yet as compressed, surprising, or image-driven as elite publication usually demands.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied structures, high information density, and figurative language that is generally clean (“petals of light unfolding from the walls,” “a tapestry of reconciled memories”). There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and nearly every line advances character, world, or theme. The prose flirts with lyricism but stops short of purple, maintaining clarity even in its more ornate images. A touch more textural contrast—moments of plainer, harder prose—might sharpen the emotional turns further.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, high-density, and musical, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and psychology. Recurrent images (mist, stars, tail, sanctuary) are handled with relative restraint, though “she shed the layer…” and some abstract noun clusters (“deeper work,” “reconstruction of resilience”) edge toward mild redundancy. There are no major loops, muddled metaphors, or clarity issues; action order and logical connectors are clear. Trimming a few explanatory lines would sharpen momentum and let the strongest images carry more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally lean yet evocative, with many doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“meteor hush,” “a sound like rustling parchment”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and disciplined; only occasionally does it verge on density (“raw, scraped clean” plus multiple metaphors in proximity). There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and grammar and sequencing are clean. The main limitation is that the consistently elevated register slightly flattens dynamic range, keeping some beats at the same lyrical intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is largely strong: sentences are grammatically clean, images mostly precise, and the rhythm has a measured, cinematic quality. The prose occasionally tips into purple or redundant phrasing—multiple reaffirmations of her purpose, motif reiterations, and a tendency to restate the same emotional beat in slightly different words. Still, most lines do more than one job (image, mood, and concept at once), and momentum is preserved for this kind of lyric narrative. Tightening repetitions and trimming a few abstract restatements would lift it toward publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and largely free of grammatical issues, with a clear sense of flow from sentence to sentence. Descriptive density supports mood, and most lines contribute either to atmosphere or thematic reinforcement. There is noticeable repetition of concepts and formulations (“across the unwritten calendar,” “remembered stardust,” “shadowed rapture,” rest and alignment framed in similar ways), creating a mild sense of redundancy and blunting impact. Figurative language stays coherent but leans toward the generic and abstract rather than sharply particular images under peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is strong and often beautiful, with rich imagery and generally clean syntax and rhythm; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood/character). There is some mild overwriting and repetition—occasional restatements of her method or status (“she was occasionally everywhere”)—that could be tightened without loss. Figurative language remains coherent and legible, avoiding mixed metaphors even as density runs high. Momentum is maintained despite the lyricism, but a bit more concision in the middle passages would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished: sentences vary in rhythm, images are specific, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and world-building. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent with the mechanical-organic conceit, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or padded scaffolding. A slight tendency toward lushness (“the hum of insight,” “probable miracles,” repeated cadences) risks saturation but doesn’t yet obscure clarity or momentum. With minor tightening of modifiers, this would be fully ready for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally fluent, with strong sensory images and a clear throughline, and most sentences perform multiple functions (setting, mood, character). There is some repetition of phrases and concepts (“shoreline lullaby,” “indirect routes,” “unused courage”) without fresh inflection, and a few lines drift toward purple or explanatory (“She realized the vigil was not just a watch, but an active waiting”). Despite occasional tell-heavy or thematically declarative sentences, clarity and momentum are maintained, and there are no serious artifacts or figurative muddles. Tightening abstraction and trimming redundant explanatory lines would sharpen the already solid craft.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and evocative, with strong images (cobalt walls absorbing weak daylight, the narrow iron staircase choked with neglect). Information density is decent, and most sentences do at least two jobs (atmosphere plus theme, or character plus world). There is some conceptual and lexical repetition (“unpardonable silence,” “cost of safety,” “duty to remain”) that verges on paraphrase-loop and a mild tendency toward abstract phrasing rather than concrete embodiment. These issues don’t obscure sense or closure, but they do keep the line-level from feeling fully honed for an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is lush and generally precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization (“its shelves curved like sleeping dragons under strata of dust” is a standout). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme, avoiding mixed-metaphor confusion, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. At times the density of imagery and abstraction (“cycles measured across the pause of shifting constellations,” “weight of authenticity”) slows momentum and edges toward purple. Tightening a few ornate lines, especially around thematic statements, would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and largely efficient, with some strong images (mechanical tendrils, white skeletal corals, mismatched coastlines). There are moments of cliché or overfamiliar construction (“washed over Kaelen like a tide,” “cleansing years of doubt and sorrow”) and a slight tendency to repeat thematic terms. Explanatory sentences occasionally restate points the imagery has already made. Still, momentum is maintained and clarity never suffers.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and clear, with some striking images (“a calm so profound it felt like a storm held in check”) and good integration of sensory detail. There is some repetition and mild purple tendency—“meaning in the mess,” “thunderous serenity,” and variations on hum and glow recur with limited fresh inflection—but it doesn’t seriously drag momentum or obscure action. Most sentences carry at least two jobs (setting plus mood; object plus interior), though a few could be tightened to reduce summarizing and redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and easy to follow, with good information density and minimal scaffolding. Sensory images (“warm mist,” “translucent amber orb,” “shower of light that infused Elara with visions”) are vivid without tipping into full purple. There is some conceptual repetition and slightly on-the-nose phrasing (“implanted destiny,” “evolving tradition with intent,” “reconstruction not just of buildings, but of spirit”) that could be tightened or made subtler. Still, line-level craft supports rather than impedes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clear, mostly lean, and often effective, with strong images like the automated beam sweeping fog and grafting as a healing metaphor. Sentence-level rhythm is readable, and there are few outright clunky constructions or ambiguities. That said, there is noticeable repetition and scaffold (“anchored optimism,” “pearl of stillness,” “somatic markers,” and explanatory restatements of her coping process) that could be cut or made more oblique for density. A touch of therapy-speak and conceptual redundancy in the final third prevents the language from achieving a truly polished, elite finish.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, theme), rhythm is varied, and there are few if any syntactic or clarity errors. However, figurative language is very dense (“kaleidoscope of half-remembered smiles,” “luminescent ache,” “cartographer of souls”), and similar emotional notes are repeated, which occasionally blurs sharpness and feels mildly overwrought. Some concepts are restated with slight variation (walls closing in, necessary darkness) without always adding new pressure. Tightening a few metaphors and pruning redundancy would lift momentum and give the strongest images more space.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with metaphors like “sky a bruised purple” and caves as “frozen waves” that feel apt rather than strained. Most sentences carry multiple loads—worldbuilding, mood, and character—so the line-level density is solid without obvious scaffolding or repetition. There is some mild overwriting and a tendency to restate insights near the end, but it doesn’t seriously drag momentum or obscure sense. The language is strong enough for competitive venues, though a final polish to trim explanation and tighten key beats would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is grammatical, readable, and occasionally striking, with a few well-chosen images (truth as “cryogenically preserved”). Yet there is noticeable repetition of key abstractions and constructions (“dizzying quiet,” “unspoken conversation,” “contraband truths,” “The scandal would…”), creating mild synonym-loop fatigue. Many sentences tell emotional or thematic content instead of layering new concrete detail, slightly dulling momentum. Line-level craft is solid but not sharply compressed or surprising enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, with a smooth rhythm and few outright clunkers. However, it leans on repetition of key words and structures (“after the tower fell,” “inculcated,” “engraved quiet”) and on abstract nouns rather than concrete, sensory specifics, which flattens momentum. Figurative language is modest but sometimes verge on purple or tautological (“tranquil blaze,” “senselessly perceptive”) without adding precision. Information density is acceptable, yet many sentences do similar thematic work, suggesting room to tighten and sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are grammatically clean, imagery is striking (“sleepwalking constellations,” “feral lullaby”), and most lines serve both atmosphere and progression. There is some repetition of structure and concept (multiple mentions of zigzagging, patterns breaking, voicing silence) that could be tightened without loss. A few explanatory or summarizing lines blunt the otherwise evocative texture. The prose is above-average but not yet razor-sharp or maximally economical.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, with varied sentence rhythms and minimal redundancy; most lines pull double duty for atmosphere and psychology. Metaphors (gravitational pulls, orbits, grooves of remorse) are coherent and thematically unified rather than piled on at random. There is some mild abstraction (“burning need to break the cycle”) that could be grounded a bit more, but it does not significantly drag momentum or clarity. Overall, line-level craft is publishable and controlled, if not yet dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often striking, with some memorable images and a clear rhythmic sensibility. Yet there is noticeable repetition of similar abstract constructions and thematic vocabulary, leading to a mild sense of redundancy and over-explanation, especially near the end. Figurative language sometimes stacks (“tether the frayed threads of time,” “tapestry of redemption,” “monument to the insect’s eternal quiet”) without adding new precision, edging into purple. Tighter, more concrete lines in pivotal beats would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is fluent, generally concise, and rich with sensory images that carry both atmosphere and meaning; many sentences do double duty in setting and emotional shading. Rhythm varies well, and key beats (“an emergent hush fell, a profound quiet that was not empty but full”) land musically. There is some conceptual and adjectival repetition (“lilac” unease/mist; general phrases like “beautiful, complicated puzzle”) and a few lines that summarize insight rather than letting images bear it. These mild artifacts prevent entry into the very highest band but do not seriously impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, with generally clean syntax, strong nouns, and purposeful figurative language that aligns with the story’s motifs. Some phrases and concepts are reiterated without adding pressure (“to cradle empathy in arms of steel,” “warm coldness,” explanations of her mission), nudging toward mild redundancy. The density of abstraction occasionally softens immediacy, but clarity is never lost and the closure image lands cleanly. Overall, line-level craft is solidly above average, just shy of elite tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is polished and generally clear, with good information density and purposeful figurative language. However, metaphor and elevated phrasing are overused (“tapestry of renewal,” “vortex of potential,” “painted the air in weeping violets and hopeful yellows”), creating occasional purple-thickness that could be tightened. There are minor redundancies in describing nostalgia and longing that don’t add new pressure. None of this damages clarity or closure, but it does slightly blunt impact in an elite-market context.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally clear and fluid, with most sentences advancing atmosphere or interiority without obvious scaffolding. There is some redundancy in concepts (“fractally precise,” “hidden pathways,” repeated references to somatic markers) and a few explanatory sentences that could be trimmed. Figurative language is mostly controlled and legible; the occasional abstraction (“willowglass hope”) lands because it’s anchored in the preceding image. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the paragraph flow from feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are generally clean, grammatical, and readable, with a steady rhythm and clear sequencing of events. There is some redundancy and mild telling—reiterating the fossil’s significance and Kaelen’s purpose rather than trusting prior images—and a tendency toward similar sentence structures and intensifiers. Figurative language is modest and usually coherent; nothing crucial is obscured by purple prose or muddled metaphor. The line-level work is solidly competent but not yet at the incisive, highly compressed level expected for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear, fluid, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. Recurrent phrases (“unearthed silence,” “truth unraveled,” emphasis on inspiration) and some thematic restatement introduce mild redundancy but do not seriously harm momentum. Figurative language is mostly apt and not excessively stacked, so clarity stays high. The line-level work is strong but not razor-edged; a tighter pass removing echoing formulations would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lines are clean, grammatical, and mostly concise, with some nice phrases (“mist coiling around him like forgotten secrets,” “silver hush”). There is some repetition of key formulations (the earth’s tilt, “silver hush,” “fix what was broken”) that occasionally feels slightly on-the-nose but doesn’t seriously impede momentum. Figurative language is fairly dense yet usually coherent; it does not devolve into muddle or mixed metaphors. Overall, the prose is solid and fluent, if somewhat conventional in its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and generally fluent, and many images (mist, ticking gutters, muddy bank) work well. Yet there is substantial repetition and scaffold: multiple near-duplicate lines about memories “percolating,” “ambient awareness,” and “spindrift serenity” dilute impact rather than deepen it. Figurative language trends purple and abstract in places, slowing momentum in what is already a static scene. Tighter pruning and more varied, concrete phrasing would significantly sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, with good sentence variety and efficient, multi-purpose lines that advance mood, setting, and theme simultaneously. Imagery like “sharp gentleness” and “fractured timelines” is distinctive, though leaned on more than once. A few phrases edge toward purple or explanatory (“core concept of this place”), but they don’t seriously obscure sense or momentum. Overall, line-level craft is strong, just shy of the razor-honed austerity expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, with some elegant images (moonlight on the silver harbor, light raking over mossy crevices). However, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases and concepts (the “quivering hush,” “instill,” the rose cycle) without each recurrence adding new pressure, creating a mild sense of redundancy. Several lines state theme or interiority in abstract terms rather than letting concrete action carry the weight, which slightly dulls momentum. Overall, the line-level craft is solid but not yet distilled to the density and freshness expected at a top market.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and rhythmically smooth, with strong, concrete nouns and a controlled lyrical register. Key images (the humming stones, glowing sundial, fading Aetherians) are clear and memorable. There is some repetition of phrasing and concepts (“brittle awakening,” isolation/independence equations, library as testament), and a tendency toward abstract summary in places where scene could carry weight. Still, line-level craft rarely obscures meaning or momentum and supports the atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished, with generally clean syntax, varied sentence structures, and high information density—most sentences do real work for character, atmosphere, or theme. Images are often striking and sensorially grounded (e.g., the damp earth yielding, droplets on white petals), and transitions are smooth. There is some tendency toward purple or redundant phrasing around secrets, connection, and prismatic light, and a few abstractions in the climax summarize insight instead of letting image carry it. These are mild overrichness issues rather than true muddle, but they do slightly reduce momentum and sharpness at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and forward-moving, with solid sentence variety and no major clarity issues. There are some familiar phrases and mild clichés (“white noise sea,” “shot in the dark,” “grim determination”) and occasional telling where image could suffice, which flatten texture slightly. Information density is decent—most lines do at least two jobs—but a few could be tightened to avoid redundancy. Rhythm supports the build toward the broadcast and confrontation, though it doesn’t quite achieve a cutting, memorable edge.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is clear and free of major grammatical errors, but it suffers from heavy repetition and scaffolding: phrases like “during the fallow period,” “vital key,” “spatial mutiny,” “wistful rebellion,” and the compass’s importance are reiterated in near-synonymous statements. Many sentences restate identical emotional or thematic content without adding pressure or image, which flattens momentum and blurs emphasis. Figurative language is restrained rather than purple, but the information density per line is low due to looping. The end result feels padded and summary-like rather than sharp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied syntax, vivid but mostly disciplined imagery, and minimal redundancy. Lines often do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and character (e.g., mist as “shroud” echoing the dead case). There is some abstract phrasing and a mild tendency to repeat concepts (empathy, unifying opposites) rather than trusting the concrete to imply them, but it doesn’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. No major artifacts, tense slips, or figurative muddles interfere with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is generally clear and functional, with some nice images (the skeletal station, the glinting nail on the seafloor) and no major grammatical faults. There is noticeable telling and repetition—phrases like “nervously confident” and “spongey dread” recur without deepening—and some abstract language where concrete scene-writing would add force. Sentences are information-dense but can feel summarizing, especially around the probe dive and committee deliberation. Line-level craft is competent but not yet taut or surprising enough for immediate elite-publication readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is fluent and grammatically clean, with a consistent lyric cadence and some vivid images (the fluttering fabric casting “shifting patterns on the ground, like a living diagram”). However, it verges on purple at times, stacking modifiers and repeating key phrases and metaphors (“ashes of ‘never,’” “luminous disbelief,” “pixelated amnesty”) without adding new facets. Several sentences paraphrase the same realization in slightly different words, which softens momentum. Trimming redundancy and varying the figurative palette would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and image-rich (“dusky harmony,” “tired giants”) with good information density. There are minor redundancies and abstractions (“polished calm,” “deep understanding of the territory,” “fragile freedom”) that feel more like labels than fresh perception. The final paragraph in particular leans on summary and conceptual phrasing rather than concrete embodiment of Leo’s internal shift. Still, nothing majorly obscures clarity or momentum, and overwriting remains just below the threshold of purple.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentences are generally grammatical and clear, but there is substantial redundancy and conceptual repetition that dulls momentum (e.g., multiple near-identical statements about shared burdens, healing with words, and variable stars as guides/emotional barometers). The prose leans on similar cadences and constructions, creating a mild drumbeat effect. Figurative language is restrained but often abstract rather than sensorial, which weakens vividness. Tightening loops and sharpening concrete detail would significantly elevate the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with dense, sensory lines that often do multiple jobs—building atmosphere and theme while advancing action. There is some tilt toward purple (“unbend the rigid silence,” “warlike serenity,” repeated abstractions about truth and confession) and a few near-redundant phrases, but not enough to muddy sense. Sentence rhythm varies adequately and grammar is clean; cause-and-effect within sentences remains clear. Tightening figurative repetitions and trimming the more expository lines in the final paragraph would markedly sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is generally clear and smooth, with varied sentence structures and efficient progression from setup to climax. Some phrases and concepts recur a touch too often (“anxious elation,” “intersection of dreams,” covenant language), flirting with mild synonym-loops and abstraction. The figurative language stays within a coherent palette and rarely confuses, though a few places lean toward purple (“a tapestry of countless possibilities weaving together”) without adding new information. Overall, momentum is maintained and there are no major artifacts, but a tighter pass to trim repetition and sharpen concrete beats would be needed for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally fluent with strong images (roots snaking between bones, burned card on a rib) and clear sequencing. Yet it leans into purple repetition and conceptual redundancy—phrases like “trammel,” “inlaying meaning,” “fiercely gentle,” and “dusky resolve” recur without always adding new pressure. Several adjacent sentences restate similar interior states in different abstractions, which saps momentum. The line-level never collapses into confusion, but a demanding editor would want tightening for density and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly concise, with a few nicely turned phrases (“After the applause, there was only this hollow quiet”). There is some redundancy and telliness—reiterating his motivation and the “core concept” explicitly—that could be tightened for greater impact. Sentences vary enough to maintain flow, and there’s no major figurative muddle or clutter. Line-level work is solid but conservative rather than striking.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally smooth, with a steady, readable cadence and coherent sequencing. There is some redundancy and abstraction—repeated explanation of “physics of transition,” “resonance,” and his ambitions being haunted/purified—which slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language clusters around magnetism and rivers/sea without becoming incoherent, but occasionally drifts into vague loftiness. Line-level craft is competent and serviceable, yet could be tightened and sharpened for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and readable, with attractive images and a consistent lyricism. However, there is noticeable redundancy and conceptual looping (“preserve wonder,” “accepting contradictions,” “after tomorrow disappears”) that could be cut for greater density. Some sentences state what the images have already implied, slightly dulling the impact of the more evocative lines. Figurative language is mostly controlled and on-theme, but the prose rarely surprises beyond its central conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are mostly clean, grammatical, and well-paced, and the piece reads smoothly aloud with some pleasing rhythms (“not blindingly, but like a dawn”). There is some repetition and mild purple-leaning abstraction (“latent radiance,” “essence,” “conduit for abandoned hopes”) that could be sharpened into more concrete language. The prose occasionally tells what the images already imply, which blunts impact. Nonetheless, there are no major artifacts or muddles; line-level craft is solid if not razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence-level craft is clean, with varied rhythms and generally efficient progression from image to image. The prose often does double duty—moving action while reflecting interior states—without excessive scaffolding. There are moments of mild purple or abstraction (“aching hum on the breeze,” “raw solace she craved”) and some reiteration of the same emotional idea, but not enough to stall momentum. Figurative language is mostly coherent and avoids mixed metaphors, keeping the closure image crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level writing is clean and grammatical, with straightforward syntax that keeps events clear. There is some repetition of phrasing and concept (“cautious exuberance,” documenting, reversals) that could be tightened for greater density. Figurative language is sparse and safe, avoiding purple prose but also missing chances for sharper, more original imagery. Momentum holds reasonably well across the piece, with few true scaffolding sentences, though the overall texture is somewhat uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, layered (doing emotional, atmospheric, and narrative work at once), and free of scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and grounded (“mulberry ache,” “the velvet no longer stifling but cradling the new hope,” the violin melting into humid air). Momentum holds through the dense imagery, with no major clarity breaks or syntactic stumbles. At an elite-publication standard, a light trim of the most abstract metaphors (“perforated destiny” as repeated phrasing) would further sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and occasionally striking, with good control of rhythm at the sentence level. At the same time, there are clear paraphrase loops and overused formulations—“threshold of stillness,” “radiant hush,” “lucidly watchful,” and variations on “drive to capture one last spark”—that restate the same idea without adding pressure or nuance. Several late paragraphs summarize and re-summarize her role and past vigils, diluting momentum. The language trends slightly purple but not incoherent; tightening repetition and cutting explanatory echoes would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level craft is competent, with clear sentences and few mechanical errors, but suffers from redundancy and paraphrase loops (e.g., reiterating “after forgiving the unforgivable,” “kindly decisive,” and the cycle of rebirth in similar terms). Figurative language like “vineyard hush” is striking once but is leaned on as a repeated label more than a deepening image. Many sentences perform the same expository or thematic work instead of adding new pressure or detail, diluting momentum. Trimming repetitions and trusting images over restated insights would significantly sharpen the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clean, with good rhythm and purposeful repetitions (cloak, mirror, chimes, breeze) that build a lyrical pattern. There is some tendency toward abstract or slightly purple diction (“spectrum of choices,” “messages deciphered and heeded,” “beautifully unresolved”) where a sharper concrete image might hit harder. The final paragraph is thematically on-the-nose, but not clumsy at the level of syntax. Line-level control is strong enough for publication with only light tightening and de-abstracting passes.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, grammatical, and carry multiple functions (worldbuilding + mood + theme) with decent economy, and there’s minimal scaffolding or obvious repetition of stems. Metaphoric density is high—pond, ripples, patterns, magnetism, dissolution—but mostly coherent; it approaches purple prose in places yet never quite tips into muddle. Some abstractions (“truths,” “patterns,” “the whole”) could be pared for greater sharpness and momentum, especially near the end where exposition thickens. Overall, the prose is polished but could benefit from a few cleaner, simpler punches at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically smooth, and image-driven, with clear sentences that rarely obscure meaning. Some lines do double duty—advancing action while reinforcing motif (e.g., skimming the arrowhead against bone to create an echo that carries the pulse). However, there is mild redundancy in phrasing and concept (dust, history, reverence, resolve) and a tendency toward abstract formulations and summary at key beats instead of concrete embodiment. The final moralizing sentence feels more like commentary than image, slightly dulling the closure’s poetic force.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are generally clean, grammatical, and readable, with a consistent lyrical register and few outright missteps. There is some repetition of key phrases and a tendency toward abstraction and summary at important beats (“the journey was treacherous”; “His story spread, inspiring mages…”), which blunts immediacy and momentum. Figurative language is mostly controlled, if somewhat familiar, and there are no major mixed metaphors or confusing constructions. Tighter pruning and more concrete scene work at turning points would noticeably elevate the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clear, well-paced, and free of obvious grammatical or structural errors, with some strong lines (“Their ascent painted the air with a meteor hush”). Sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and most lines pull their weight in advancing scene and mood. There is some repetition of diction and slightly purple combinations (“symphony of light and music intertwined,” “sacred knowledge”) that edge toward redundancy rather than sharpening focus, but they don’t significantly obscure meaning or momentum. Overall, it’s polished and readable, though still a bit reliant on familiar lyrical moves.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean and largely free of grammatical or syntactic error, with some strong images (coins on an obsidian table, amber light casting long shadows). At the same time, it leans heavily on repeated abstractions—“distill,” “purpose,” “wavelength alignment,” “static bursts”—creating a sense of conceptual loop rather than forward propulsion. Many sentences restate similar content with small variations, which slightly dulls momentum and impact. The line-level craft is solid but not especially compressed or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and generally high information density—most lines advance atmosphere, theme, and emotional state simultaneously. Visual metaphors around light, crystals, and the sea are clear and not over-mixed, and there are few if any syntactic or grammatical slips. However, some phrasing and concepts recur a bit (“crystallized echo,” “scattered light,” explicit naming of fears) in ways that feel slightly redundant, and a couple of thematic sentences read more like commentary than scene. Tightening those small loops would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with some pleasing images (“a thread of logic in a tapestry of magic”). That said, there is noticeable repetition of concepts and structures (brittle devotion, naivety, cosmic imbalance, “dripping rates”) without each return adding new pressure, which softens momentum. Figurative language is generally sensible but sometimes leans toward mild purple or summary rather than dense multi-tasking lines. Overall, it’s solid but could be tightened and made more idiosyncratic to reach a high-literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and readable, with some strong lines and recurring motifs, and sentences generally earn their keep. There is mild redundancy and summary at the end (“inspiring festivals and new traditions,” “allowing healing to flourish”) that flattens momentum into report. Certain formulations (“precisely humane,” “mirrored hush,” “spin the scattered whispers into stories”) recur or edge toward template lyricism. Line-level craft is solid but not yet taut or surprising enough for top-tier literary competition.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is fluent and largely clear, with some strong sensory images and effective sentence-level movement. Yet it leans into repetition and abstraction—multiple near-duplicate statements about harmony, transformation, and connection—and edges toward purple in places. Many sentences perform similar functions, especially in the final third, which slightly dulls momentum and the closure image. Line-level craft is solid but could be tightened for concision and sharper impact.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and clear, with good information density and very few syntactic or grammatical slips. However, there’s evident paraphrase and conceptual looping—“watcher’s burden,” “preserve trust,” “remembering through muscle memory,” and the symbolic status of the buckle are reiterated in slightly different words. Several lines state symbolism rather than allowing it to emerge (“This object was more than a tool; it was a symbol of adaptation and survival”), dulling impact. The language is effective but occasionally over-explicit, which slightly drags momentum in such a short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are generally clear, with a few striking images (“the very air shimmered as history rewrote itself”) and no major grammatical or structural errors. There is some tendency toward abstraction and summary—especially around the debate and Kael’s internal state—rather than tightly focused, sensory scene work, but it doesn’t seriously obscure meaning or momentum. Figurative language is occasional and controlled; there is no heavy purple-prose or mixed-metaphor problem. Line-level craft is solidly publishable but not yet sharpened to maximal density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatical, with a mild lyricism that creates a consistent texture and a few strong images (the seed as “possibility just born,” the brook’s flow echoing puzzle flow). At the same time, key abstractions and motifs are repeated with near-identical wording, creating a sense of scaffolding and mild redundancy rather than accumulation. Figurative language is generally safe and coherent but also leans generic, often telling us what things “symbolize” instead of letting image and action imply it. Momentum is more meditative than propulsive, which suits the mode but keeps the piece from feeling sharply cut.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is generally polished, with good rhythmic variation and many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus theme, action plus mood). Repetition of key phrases (“tending to the unspoken,” “macerate the sorrow,” “off-key wind”) reads mostly as intentional patterning rather than unedited looping. That said, there are spots of conceptual redundancy where adjacent lines restate similar ideas about grief, echoes, or haunting without materially advancing pressure. Figurative language is frequent but coherent; the main opportunity is trimming a few near-duplicate abstractions to heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with some strong images (“boundaries of light…thinning like parchment held to a flame”). However, there is notable conceptual and syntactic repetition—phrases such as “Through the veil of sleep,” “interiorized the exteriors,” and “to make friends with uncertainty” recur in ways that sometimes feel like paraphrase loops rather than fresh turns. Abstract noun clusters (“foggy lucidity,” “present awareness,” “accept this longing without resolution”) blunt immediacy. The overall rhythm and clarity remain solid, but the line-level craft falls short of fully refined, publish-now compression.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and generally clear, with a good sense of sequence, and paragraphs move the story forward without major clutter. There is some scaffold and repetition—phrases like “creative destruction,” “stifling destiny,” and reasserted motivations appear a bit often, and reagent listing edges toward exposition. The line “encapsulating the tone of frozen bloom” exemplifies a tell-heavy, slightly meta register that dulls the otherwise solid prose. Tightening abstraction and cutting redundancy would significantly sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The line-level writing is polished, grammatically clean, and often evocative, with several striking phrases and images. Yet there is noticeable repetition of concepts and formulations (beginnings in endings, silence as full, “serenely electric”), and some paraphrase-looping where sentences restate the same idea with minor variation. The density of metaphor and abstract reflection occasionally slows momentum and dulls the impact of key insights. Tightening redundancy and trusting images over explanation would significantly sharpen the piece at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean, rhythmic, and easy to follow, with decent information density and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Some language slips into slightly purple or abstract cosmic diction, and key phrases like “permanent transient” and “resiliently positive outlook” feel closer to conceptual labels than sharply embodied images. Still, there are no major loops, artifacts, or muddled metaphors, and the final image is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, with some effective lines (“a silence so deep it felt like a prelude to chaos”). There is noticeable conceptual repetition and paraphrasing—multiple sentences reassert that memories are altering, reality is both real and imagined, and the calm is unsettling—without adding pressure or new nuance. Figurative language is moderate and mostly coherent, but several phrases verge on abstract cliché (“texture of connection,” “beginning of her journey”) rather than concrete image. Momentum holds, yet line-level refinement and compression would be needed for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is clean, with varied sentence structure and generally efficient information delivery; most sentences do more than one job (worldbuilding plus mood, or character plus theme). There’s some reliance on familiar abstract phrases (“shattered old paradigms,” “void filled with awe and unease”), but they don’t derail clarity or momentum. The prose balances description, action, and reflection without obvious loops or scaffolding. It’s polished and publishable with only minor tightening of abstractions and on-the-nose theme statements.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lines are generally clear, grammatically clean, and rhythmically varied enough to maintain flow. There is some mild purple and repetition (“reeling hush,” stacked abstractions like “incidental heroism,” “silent war against oblivion”) but not enough to derail clarity. Several sentences do double duty for mood and information, and there’s little outright scaffolding or looped paraphrase. The prose is competent and occasionally evocative, but it doesn’t yet reach the compression and surprise expected at top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly concise, with purposeful description that advances both mood and action. Some images are fresh, but others lap into mild repetition or generalized language (“her fear a little lighter,” “purpose clear”), especially as the story closes. Figurative density is moderate and rarely purple; momentum generally holds from tunnel entry through escape. Line-level craft is solid and publishable with minor tightening rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, largely free of clutter, and most carry multiple duties (setting, emotion, and theme at once). Repetition patterns (“After the radio static cleared…,” several “She had…”) read as deliberate echoes rather than careless loops. A few sentences veer toward abstract telling (“This was the wisdom she sought”) and thematic declaration, which slightly dulls the otherwise rich imagery and momentum. There are no significant grammatical or syntactic artifacts, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally polished, with vivid images (“deep, black flaw running through its core like a frozen lightning bolt”) and efficient worldbuilding embedded in action. Sentences do multiple jobs—advancing plot while building atmosphere—and there is little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative density is high but controlled; metaphors are coherent and do not muddle action or stakes. A slightly more varied sentence rhythm in the midsection could add propulsion, but line-level craft is already strong enough for competitive venues.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clear and fluent, with strong, concrete images like herbs floating and stones weighted to the core, and most sentences do more than one job. There is modest redundancy in thematic statements and some abstract phrasing (“fears that festered in the silence,” “frostbitten hope”) that could be sharpened into more specific embodiment. Still, rhythm and syntax vary enough to maintain momentum, and there are no major mixed metaphors or line-level confusions. Trimming a few explanatory lines would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line-level writing is grammatically clean and easy to follow, with a steady rhythm and no major figurative misfires. Many sentences repeat structures and concepts (“tarnished wonder,” “resonantly soft,” “the gap between knowing and understanding”), creating a low-level loopiness that could be tightened. Prose tends toward telling emotional states instead of embodying them in fresh sensory or kinetic detail, which flattens peak beats. Nonetheless, there’s a coherent cadence and no serious clutter or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is clean and largely free of grammatical issues, with a steady rhythm that reads smoothly. Yet many sentences do the same conceptual work—restating Elian’s mission, his respectful rebellion, and the hope he carries—leading to paraphrase loops and a sense of telling rather than dramatizing. Figurative language is used sparingly and coherently, but the line-level lacks the compression and variety that would heighten momentum and sharpen key beats for an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and largely efficient, with strong sensory images and a good ear for rhythm; sentences often do double duty for atmosphere and character. There is some repetition of motifs and phrases (“misting hush,” “whispering gleam”) and a tendency toward stacked modifiers that occasionally verge on purple, but they don’t obscure clarity. Momentum is gentle yet steady, without scaffolding or obvious loops. A bit more pruning of adjectival density would bring it closer to elite-line precision.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clear, rhythmic, and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme, and there are few outright clumsy constructions. Nonetheless, there is some conceptual redundancy and mild purple phrasing (“realm of pure narrative energy,” “luminous space where narratives floated like constellations”) that could be trimmed for greater sharpness and momentum. Tighter line-editing to reduce repetition and over-glow would likely elevate this to a more elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is largely clean and rhythmic, with clear syntax and few, if any, mechanical errors; information density is good, and most lines advance either mood or action. There is some reliance on repeated constructions and abstract formulations (“the tone of the night was one of luminous absence,” “the action was meant to vitalize”), which can read as slightly scaffolding or explanatory rather than fully embodied. Figurative language is occasionally generic or stacked but not to the point of real opacity. The line-level craft is solidly above average, though a sharper pruning of redundancy and abstraction would be needed for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and flows smoothly, with some strong individual lines and a confident, consistent cadence. However, it leans heavily on repeated abstract formulations (“enveloped secrets,” “cosmic possibility,” “improbable longing”), creating a sense of conceptual and lexical looping rather than forward-driving specificity. Figurative language is dense but not always grounded in concrete detail, which slightly dulls the intensity of peak beats like the disorientation sequence. Still, there are no major artifacts obscuring causality, and most sentences do some atmospheric or structural work.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally well-shaped, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with concrete sensory anchors like “salt, damp earth, and the faint, sweet rot of apples.” Metaphors (broken constellations, sea glass, skeletal hulls) mostly cohere and reinforce one another, and there’s little overt scaffolding or redundancy. A few phrases and motifs (“broken constellations,” “crisp nostalgia”) recur enough to feel mildly hammered rather than deepened, and some exposition lines could be compressed. Still, the prose remains clear, propulsive, and polished enough to support an elite-market submission with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and efficiently descriptive; sentences often carry both image and emotional function. Repetition of key motifs (shadow, leaves, swing creak) builds texture rather than feeling like scaffolding. A few lines drift toward purple or slogan-like (“steel and silk in her voice”; “Resilience had been mentored”), softening the impact of otherwise strong images. Overall momentum holds, and there are no significant clarity or grammar issues.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean and largely grammatical, with some effective images (colors as streams of emotion, a net of pure intention). There is noticeable repetition of key terms and modifiers (“wonder,” “radiant hush,” “insatiable creativity”) that can feel like mild synonym-churn rather than intensification. The figurative language sometimes leans into purple without adding new information, but it doesn’t significantly obscure clarity or closure. Line-level craft is competent and occasionally pleasing, just short of the tight economy and surprise expected at elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and rhythmically varied, with evocative but legible imagery (“its fibers coarse and smelling of salt and time”). Sentences usually do more than one job—advancing action while maintaining atmosphere—and there’s little outright scaffolding. That said, there is noticeable reliance on similar constructions and repeated abstraction (silence as “heavy,” “accumulated,” “interlaced hush”), which occasionally feels like concept reiteration rather than fresh embodiment. The language flirts with purple but mostly stays controlled, keeping momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean, copy-error free, and often evocative (e.g., “rain-scoured fresco vault,” “blurred and ghostly”). That said, it suffers from paraphrase loops and recycled phrases, especially around core concepts (“methodically curious,” “empathy for the silence,” “rain-scoured,” “shielded openness”), which dilute impact and slow momentum. The closing paragraphs explain what earlier images already suggest, blunting the final cadence. Overall, it’s solid but needs tightening and more varied texture to reach elite line-level.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are generally clear and well-constructed, with a steady rhythm and few outright clunky lines. The image of books “slumbering in aqueous silence” and the snow globe besieged by a “perpetual flurry” are precise and effective. However, the later paragraphs lean on repetitive, abstract phrasing (“physics of letting go,” “integration into the cosmos,” “universal current,” “sophisticated melancholy”) that softens impact and feels slightly over-written. The line-level craft is solid but could be tightened and grounded more in concrete image to reach a truly elite register.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally polished, grammatically clean, and rich in image, with several lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Yet it leans into purple repetition (“driftingly alert,” “tinkersong wonder,” multiple mentions of mist and lightning/thunder) without always adding new pressure or information. Many sentences pile modifiers and abstractions in similar rhythms, which softens momentum and occasionally blurs emphasis. The line-level craft is solid and readable but not as ruthlessly economical or varied as top-tier short fiction typically demands.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level craft is generally smooth and readable, with clear syntax and a pleasing rhythmic variety. Some metaphors and modifiers verge on purple or redundant (“warmly inquisitive anticipation,” “felt fated,” repeated invocations of “affectionate detachment”), diluting impact. Information density is solid but not razor-sharp; a few sentences summarize or restate interior states rather than advancing them. The final cadence is clean and lands the intended mood without being obscured by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is clean and readable, with few syntactic or grammatical slips and mostly clear images. Repetitions of key phrases and structures (“After the string broke,” “dusty starlight,” “spooled wholeness”) generally function as motif but border on redundancy, as they rarely bring new nuance when they recur. The prose leans into abstraction and conceptual language, occasionally sacrificing vivid physicality or surprise. Still, information density is decent, and there are no serious artifacts that obscure meaning or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level writing is controlled and efficient: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without padding. Figurative language (e.g., “fractally precise,” “stolen a piece of the firmament”) is apt and not over-stacked. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; the prose keeps its momentum even in descriptive passages. A touch more variation in sentence rhythm at the end could heighten the impact of the final realization, but current execution is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clear and fluent, with some nicely chosen images (e.g., “strands of luminance, seemingly stranded between the birds' wings”). There is mild repetition (especially of “sociable isolation” and explanatory phrasing) and some scaffolding sentences that could be trimmed without loss. Figurative language stays within control and doesn’t lapse into muddle or purple, but the line-level never quite surprises or compresses meaning in a striking way. Momentum is serviceable, though occasionally slowed by redundant explanation of what the reader can already infer.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished, rhythmic, and image-rich, with few if any syntactic errors or clumsy constructions. Many sentences multitask—building atmosphere while advancing motion or interiority—so line-level density is decent. There is some repetition of favored phrases and a mild tendency toward purple abstraction in emotional description, but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or momentum. Trimming a few near-duplicate beats and on-the-nose explanations would elevate it to genuinely standout craft.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level writing is clean, rhythmic, and largely free of scaffolding or loops; nearly every sentence carries either image, worldbuilding, or emotional charge. Recurrent metaphors around plants, light, and resonance create cohesion, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. There are a few familiar turns of phrase and slightly on-the-nose constructions (“their hearts full of a hope that had weathered thorns to finally bloom”) that blunt sharpness. Overall, though, clarity and economy remain strong and no artifacts interfere with closure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmical, and easy to follow, with few outright redundancies or syntactic stumbles. Several lines do effective double duty, advancing both concept and mood (e.g., the lighthouse beam pulsing with her song; the puppet mending with golden light). However, there is noticeable reliance on similar abstract constructions and repeated adjectives (“soft,” “gentle,” “final,” “beautifully flawed”), along with stacked, elevated metaphors that sometimes verge on purple. Information density is acceptable, but line-level variety and precision would need tightening for top-market readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences are generally clear, varied, and purposeful, with minimal scaffolding or repetition, and most lines do more than one job (world, mood, and stakes at once). Figurative language is used sparingly and mostly effectively; “graceless beauty” is a strong motif rather than purple excess. There is mild redundancy in the closing thematic explanation, but it doesn’t materially drag momentum or blur the closure image. Grammar and sequencing are clean, supporting smooth reading.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is clean and readable, with mostly precise sentences and efficient progression from scene to idea to outcome. There is some redundancy and a noticeable reliance on familiar abstractions and phrases (“every end is a beginning in disguise,” “symphony of molecules,” “transforming loss”), which feel a bit generic for this level of ambition. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent; it occasionally leans purple without quite obscuring meaning. Overall, the prose is solidly publishable but lacks the compression, freshness, and risk that mark elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is smooth and largely clean at the sentence level, with a strong ear for cadence and some striking images. Yet there is noticeable repetition and paraphrase—key phrases like “quantifying absence,” “integrated fragmentation,” “glimmering parole,” and restatements of the same realizations recur without adding new pressure. Abstract noun clusters often replace concrete embodiment, softening immediacy and momentum. The overall effect is attractive but somewhat padded and concept-heavy for the word count, which an elite venue would expect to be tighter and more texturally varied.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, with strong imagery and relatively few syntactic or grammatical errors. Yet there is noticeable redundancy: concepts and metaphors (tidal pools, sandpapering, subsuming) are reiterated without always adding new nuance, creating a mild sense of looped scaffolding. Figurative language occasionally veers toward purple or stacked abstraction, though it remains mostly coherent. Tightening repetition and cutting a few near-duplicate lines would sharpen momentum and increase information density.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally fluent and controlled, with good information density and a clear progression from sentence to sentence. Some metaphors and phrases recur or verge on purple (“borrowed starlight,” “vigorous tender sound”), but they are not so stacked as to obscure sense or drag momentum. There is mild redundancy in restating the clock’s symbolic role and the silos’ separation, yet not enough to feel like scaffolding. Line-level craft is solid and readable, if a bit safe and occasionally sentimental for the standards of top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with some striking images (the spectrum painting the canyon walls, the spiderwebbed mirror reflecting lives instead of her face). However, figurative language is dense and often repetitive—phrases like “quaking reverie,” “archeologist of abandoned dreams,” and “entangled memories” recur without always deepening meaning. There’s a tendency toward abstract phrasing and summary (“The period of transformation intensified,” “Her actions remained chaotically precise”) instead of fresh, concrete instantiation. This produces a mild purple-prose sheen and some conceptual redundancy without fully obscuring sense.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and rhythmically controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and plot. There is some repetition of key phrases (“threshold effects,” “clandestinely luminous,” “seeds of vigilance”) that edges toward incantatory but doesn’t quite tip into redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and aligned with the world’s logic; it rarely muddies sense or momentum. A bit of conceptual abstraction could be tightened in places to heighten immediacy, yet line-level craft is solidly above average.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images and a consistent sonic quality that supports the subject matter. There is some mild overwriting and conceptual redundancy (reasserting silence, stillness, and empathy in similar ways), but not enough to seriously drag momentum. Sentences usually do more than one job—world-building, tone, and theme at once—though a few could be cut for concision. Line-level craft is above average but not yet razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly propulsive, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization. Vivid images such as twilight “bleeding into indigo” and the dent pulsing with his heartbeat are effective. However, there is mild abstraction and redundancy—reiterating “correlating,” “translating silence,” and covenant backstory—that could be tightened, and the figurative density edges toward purple in places. None of these issues obscure causality, but they keep the line work just below elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, but it leans into repetition and abstraction (“the path to empathy,” “varieties of silence,” “her mission,” “her cause”) that could be compressed or dramatized. Several adjacent sentences rephrase similar ideas about empathy and silence without adding new pressure or image, creating a mild paraphrase-loop effect. Moments of concrete specificity (the clasp’s faint click, silence between heartbeats) are strong but diluted by explanatory sentences that tell us what they mean. Rhythm and sentence variety are serviceable yet rarely leveraged to heighten or release tension.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clear, rhythmic, and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. At times, the language edges toward purple, with stacked metaphors and repeated conceptual phrases (“undercurrent of wisdom,” “tide of thought”) that could be pared back for greater sharpness and momentum. Nonetheless, there are few true redundancies, and causality and action remain intelligible throughout. Line-level craft is solid and occasionally striking, though not yet at an elite, cut-to-the-bone standard.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clear, grammatically clean, and flows well, with good sentence variety and efficient scene progression. Descriptive language is generally well-chosen and not overwrought, and information density is respectable—most lines do real work for setting or concept. There is some mild redundancy and a tendency toward explanatory phrasing in the latter third, but no major loops or purple patches that drag momentum or obscure meaning. At an elite level, one would expect a bit more compression and sharper, more surprising turns of phrase in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is fluent, generally concise, and often carries multiple functions (atmosphere, character, and theme) in single sentences. Some phrasing tips into repetition and abstraction—“foresight,” “convergence,” “silence,” and “cultivate” recur enough to feel slightly didactic rather than texturally intentional. Figurative language is mostly controlled, but a few lines feel like conceptual restatements instead of fresh images. Momentum holds through to the end, though trimming some thematic scaffolding would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level writing is polished and grammatically clean, with a strong rhythmic sense and some striking images (“a rainbow imprisoned and yearning for freedom”). Yet the prose frequently layers abstractions (“oscillating repose,” “certify wonder as essential”) and similar constructions, creating a mild purple, repetitive feel. Figurative language appears densely and sometimes redundantly without always adding new facets, which slows momentum. Despite this, clarity is maintained and the closure image lands intact.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence-level craft is clean and readable, with few grammatical or syntactic missteps and a consistent rhythmic calm that suits the contemplative mode. Several lines carry multiple functions (atmosphere plus theme plus action), and key images like the gilded flute and driftwood markers recur usefully. However, there is some paraphrase-like repetition and reliance on familiar constructions and metaphors (“calm after a storm,” “harvest insights from failure”), and abstraction occasionally replaces concrete texture. The prose is solid and serviceable, not yet razor-honed or formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, dense with information, and most images do more than one job. The recurring phrases (“deliberate ambiguity,” “transposed empathy”) feel like intentional leitmotifs rather than lazy repetition. A few formulations edge toward mild purple or conceptual redundancy, but they don’t seriously impede clarity or momentum, and the closure image remains sharp. Overall, the prose supports rather than overwhelms the story’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, well-punctuated, and rhythmically varied enough to maintain flow, with some nice images (“stretching the moment like taffy,” “rocky spine of the ridge”). There is some conceptual repetition and explanatory layering that could be tightened, particularly around the pendant’s function and the memory-to-myth motif. Figurative language is used sparingly and mostly coherently; it rarely becomes purple or confusing. Line-level craft is above average but not yet razor-honed—several sentences reiterate information rather than adding new pressure or texture.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and flows without major confusion, and some images (rainbows cast across icy patterns, crystalline trees in mist) are effective. However, there’s noticeable redundancy and cliché (“struck her like a physical blow,” “her world tilted on its axis,” reiterations of her mission and groundedness) that could be cut for concision and freshness. Sentences often explain what the images have already implied, reducing density. The rhythm is serviceable but not especially varied or propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose often carries vivid images and strong cadence, and key objects (loom, bead, silence) are described with memorable specificity. However, figurative language and modifiers are dense, with repeated constructions and phrases that edge toward purple and occasionally feel redundant rather than additive. Some sentences perform similar emotional work back-to-back (silence advancing, world fraying, her vitality draining), softening momentum. Line-level craft is solid but could be tightened for concision and sharper impact.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically sound and easy to follow, but it relies heavily on repetition and paraphrase (“quietly determined,” “deliberate,” “coax resilience from rubble,” “awakening,” “defiance”), which dulls momentum and freshness. Many sentences summarize rather than doing layered work, so information density and propulsion are modest. There is some purple-leaning diction (“azure defiance,” “bartered awakenings”) that feels more ornamental than earned in scene. Line-level craft is competent but not at the precision or compression required for immediate top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, syntactically varied, and free of mechanical errors, with some striking images (“hands stained with starlight”). At times, it leans into mild purple prose and conceptual repetition—“weight,” “murmur of dreams,” and similar formulations recur without always adding new nuance. Explanatory sentences about method (“His method was through parallel universes...”) slow momentum and tell what the scene could show. Line-level craft is solid but not razor-honed; some trimming and sharpening would increase density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sentence-level variety and a high density of lines that do double duty for setting and emotion. Figurative language is vivid yet controlled; while the piece leans lush (“air hummed with a luminescent ache”), it largely avoids mixed metaphors or redundancy. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or filler scaffolds, and pacing is well modulated between calm observation and charged action. Minor tendencies toward purple at times are more a stylistic risk than a true flaw, slightly restraining a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and mostly clear, and key images (the glass wick catching starlight, the emerald beam over water) land. However, there is notable redundancy: phrases such as “otherworldly routine,” “shadowed elation,” “accidentally prophetic,” and “through total internal reflection” recur without adding new angles. Several adjacent lines paraphrase each other’s concepts, giving a slight sense of purple, padded texture rather than taut progression. The prose works but lacks the ruthless compression and variation expected at a top market.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence-level craft is mostly clean, with few outright errors and a pleasant rhythmic variety, and many lines carry multiple duties (worldbuilding, mood, and interiority at once). However, the prose often drifts into purple territory with stacked modifiers and repeated conceptual phrasing (e.g., “quietly explosive,” “valley-mist wonder,” reiterations of “stories” and “iridescent” in similar constructions). Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea—beauty masking peril; stories clinging to certain souls—without adding new pressure or detail. This ornamental density slightly slows momentum and dulls the closure beat’s sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is clean and readable, with mostly clear sequencing and serviceable rhythm, and avoids egregious purple excess. Still, there are noticeable abstractions, mild cliché (“silent corridors of her heart,” “her heart skipping a beat”), and paraphrastic reiterations of ideas (e.g., miracles in simple things restated in slightly different language). Information density could be higher; several sentences summarize emotion or theme instead of letting concrete images carry them. Line-level craft is solidly competent but would need tightening and sharpening to meet top-tier literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and rich in metaphor without devolving into confusion; many lines do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Information density is solid, though some middle paragraphs re-explain the songs’ communal function in slightly expository language that could be tightened. Figures are generally coherent and apt; there is little synonym churn or obvious scaffolding. The overall effect is lush rather than overblown, but trimming a few abstract summarizing sentences would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and flows without major confusion, and there are no glaring line-level artifacts or mixed metaphors. However, it leans heavily on repetition of key phrases (“nestled paradoxes,” “enlarged tranquility”) and abstract summary, which thins momentum and specificity. Many sentences do single-duty explanation rather than carrying layered information through image and action. The language is solidly functional but lacks the compression, vividness, and textural surprise of publish-now literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are mostly lean, varied, and purposeful, with few redundancies and clean grammar. Figurative language is present but measured, and most metaphors are coherent and apt, doing multiple jobs at once (e.g., gardening as “archaeological love”). There is some tendency toward abstraction and stacked conceptual nouns in places, but it rarely muddies sense or drags momentum. The closing lines land crisply, with a clear, concrete image set (“journal, the bread, the quiet tea house, and her own gentle hands”).

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and readable with a solid ear for cadence, and most sentences advance both atmosphere and situation. However, there are noticeable redundancies and echo phrases—core lines like “to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion” recur almost verbatim, and some sentences paraphrase others without adding pressure or detail. Figurative language occasionally drifts toward purple or over-dense without furthering escalation, creating a sense of sameness. These issues don’t obscure causality, but they do soften momentum and keep the line-level craft from feeling razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and rhythmic, with strong noun-verb choices and sensory density that mostly pulls its weight. There is some redundancy and mild scaffolding—re-explaining the false starts, reiterating the “comforting unease,” and restating that she had “until sunrise” even after the urgency is clear—which slightly slows momentum. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, though a few phrases lean generic rather than precise (“her resolve unshaken,” “heart pounding a rhythm”). Line-level craft is strong but not ruthlessly tight; trimming repetition and sharpening a few abstractions would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, varied, and purposeful, with sensory density that does double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Metaphors like “terrestrially cosmic bridge” and “pockets of sunlight clinging to them like cloaks” are vivid without becoming incoherent or overmixed. There is some repetition in explanatory phrasing and occasional near-summary (“This was the terrestrially cosmic truth”) that slightly flattens momentum, but not enough to obscure causality or dull the ending. The prose edges toward purple at moments yet stays controlled and readable.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear, rhythmic, and free of mechanical errors, with some strong images (charcoal-stained fingers, the prismatic cave, the lock as a held failure). Sentences often carry more than one job—advancing both mood and action—and there’s reasonable variation in structure. However, there is mild purple-leaning repetition and abstraction (“auroral sorrow” repeated, several “she felt”/“she knew” formulations) that could be tightened for greater impact. The strongest moments are concrete (sketching her younger self, leaving the lock behind), suggesting the piece would benefit from shaving a few high-level, summary lines.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are clear, grammatical, and mostly economical; exposition about the world and her history is handled in smooth, compact paragraphs. Several lines do double duty, carrying both atmosphere and theme, and there are no glaring loops or metaphor muddles. Some passages edge toward explanatory summary (e.g., the direct articulation of realizations and motives) where a more dramatized beat would have greater impact. Line-level craft is solid but not yet at the razor-sharp, everything-earned standard of top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    The line-level writing is sound: sentences are grammatically clean, generally clear, and often do double duty for both image and theme. Some images (the iceberg’s prismatic light as “visible music”) are evocative and well-chosen. However, there is noticeable repetition of certain formulations and abstractions, and occasional edging into purple prose without new informational gain. The overall momentum is more gently meditative than propulsive, which fits the concept but limits intensity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and mostly concise, with some strong images like “tiny, crystallized terrors” and “a silent, brilliant flame.” There is mild redundancy and abstraction in the back half, where sentences restate theme more than advance scene, softening momentum. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent; it stops short of full purple-prose excess. Line-level craft is clearly competent, but not yet pared to the density and freshness an elite venue would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with generally clear sequencing and minimal redundancy. Some metaphors and idioms are conventional (“weight lifting from his shoulders,” “raspy melody,” “heavy with history”), which keeps the line-level effect pleasant but not striking. Information density is decent: sentences typically advance character or situation without obvious filler. There is a mild tendency toward abstract summary in key emotional beats, but no major loops or artifacts that damage momentum or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, readable, and occasionally striking, with good information density and few wasted sentences. Metaphors (spider, web, music in code, encrypted vulnerability) are consistent rather than chaotic, though at times they edge toward the purple. Some lines paraphrase prior content (her vow, her calm defiance, the lab’s “mysterious familiarity”) without adding new pressure, which slightly dulls momentum. Still, rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the piece from feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally polished, with vivid metaphors, good sentence variety, and high information density; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or world. Physical and sensory details (swinging lanterns, halite cubes, heavy-then-weightless soil) are concrete and clear, and the sequencing of action is easy to follow. There is some repetition and mild purple tendency—phrases like “gleaming silence” and explicit thematic restatements recur, and several sentences in the ending paraphrase the same realization. Tightening those loops and trimming the more didactic lines would sharpen momentum and leave the final image more potent.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.5)
    Line-level writing is grammatical and clear, but heavily reliant on repetition and abstract modifiers, which dilutes impact. Key phrases and concepts are cycled many times with minimal new information, creating a sense of synonym churn and scaffolding in the final third. Figurative language generally makes sense but stays broad; there are few precise, surprising images to carry weight. The rhythmic monotony of similarly structured sentences contributes to a meditative feel but also to momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and musical, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and sentence rhythms varying enough to avoid monotony. Extended metaphors (city as library, bones and veins of buildings) are coherent and not over-stacked to the point of confusion. There is some density of figurative language that occasionally risks purple, but it doesn’t materially obscure sense or closure. Information is efficiently compressed for backstory (the sugar pretext, the weekly teas) without sacrificing momentum in this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentences are grammatical and clear, and the line-level work mostly carries story, mood, and information efficiently. There is noticeable redundancy in concepts and phrasing (“translated her isolation into independence,” “tragically radiant,” repeated star/dawn markers) that could be tightened without loss. Figurative language and abstractions sometimes edge toward purple or generic (“a realm of deep shadows and softer light,” “a testament to the power of turning pain into purpose”), diluting impact. The closure image is legible but not sharply cut, and the piece would benefit from more economical, specific lines at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally fluent and grammatically clean, with some graceful images (the thorn catching “the aurora’s gleam like a fragment of the twilight sky”). However, there is noticeable redundancy in both concept and phrasing—the idea of “calibrated treason,” the thorn as a key with no lock, and her long endurance of guilt are restated without adding pressure or nuance. The diction occasionally tips toward purple and abstract (“motivation to forgive the unfinished,” “calibrate her own redemption”), which slightly dulls immediacy. Line-by-line, most sentences carry weight, but a tighter, more concrete pass would significantly sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level craft is grammatically clean and generally clear, but it leans heavily on abstract nouns and repeated formulations (“webs of intrigue,” “progressive disclosure,” “universe hummed its secret song”) that create a sense of redundancy. Figurative language is serviceable but often generic or imprecise (“reed-blown melancholy,” “boundless connections”) and rarely grounded in concrete sensory detail. Several adjacent sentences restate similar ideas—particularly around true vs. false echoes and the nexus’s corruption—dampening momentum. The prose is functional but not yet sharp or economical enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and clear, with several strong images (walls “like frozen constellations,” dreams as “borrowed starlight”). There is some conceptual and phrase repetition that veers toward scaffolding rather than intensification, and several lines state what the reader already infers (“This selfless act was the pure thing Kaelen aimed to salvage”). Many pivotal beats—particularly the investigation—are told in compressed summary, reducing line-level vividness and momentum. The figurative language is coherent but safe, without the sharp, surprising precision expected at a top literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, with vivid images and mostly smooth rhythm; many sentences carry dual duties of scene-setting and thematic echo. However, it leans toward purple at times (“scintillatingly somber,” repeated motif explanations) and occasionally paraphrases its own insights in slightly different words. Figurative language density is high without always deepening meaning, which dulls momentum in what is already a low-pressure piece. Still, line-level clarity holds, and there are no serious grammatical or syntactic faults.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, economical, and vivid, with strong images like “radioactive dust that glowed faintly under a bruised sky” and the milky, cracked diamond pulsing in his hand. Sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and plot) without obvious scaffolding or repetition, though a few explanatory lines (“The liquidation hadn’t been an accident…”) lean toward summary. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there are no major figurative muddles or template cadences. A slight reduction in abstract explanatory clauses in the climax would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, rhythmic, and clear, with many lines doing double duty for mood and character (“The descent was a symphony of thunder and revelation, each step a beat in the rhythm of change”). However, figurative language is dense throughout, leading to occasional purple over-saturation and minor redundancy (reiterating “gritty whimsy,” “lyrically prophetic,” and storm/radio metaphors in similar ways). There are no serious clarity issues or scaffolding loops, but some sentences could be pared back to sharpen impact and momentum. The final images land cleanly despite the lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong imagery and a good ear for cadence (“sunlight filtered through cracks in the dunes like scattered gold”). There is some paraphrase/redundancy—variations on redemption, atonement, translation, and preservation are reiterated in similar abstract terms. Figurative density occasionally borders on purple (“positively wistful,” “lonesome splendor,” “pocket full of captured dawns”) and could be trimmed for tautness. Still, clarity and momentum hold, and no line-level artifact significantly obscures cause/effect or dulls the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatically sound, with strong sensory images and some effective metaphors (ice like shattered glass, sound waves soothing the marina). There is noticeable repetition of concepts and descriptors, and a tendency toward purple phrasing that occasionally blurs precision (“fleshly ethereal presence,” “tangible light and whispered echoes”). Several adjacent sentences paraphrase each other’s emotional state or purpose, which slightly drags momentum. Nonetheless, the line-level craft remains serviceable and occasionally evocative rather than obstructive.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with smooth syntax and few mechanical issues. Yet there are clear paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancies—“patient revolution,” “unyoke,” “softly purposeful,” and explanations of what unyoking means recur without adding new pressure or nuance. Some lines define terms already evident from context (“To unyoke meant to release, to set free from a burden…”), which slightly dulls momentum. The prose is solid and at times beautiful, but could be tightened to avoid repetition and heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and generally fluent, with some nice atmospheric touches (the drip of water echoing like a heartbeat, the lantern’s flicker animating shadows). However, there is noticeable repetition of phrasing and concepts (“entangled memories,” “watchfully calm,” overt statements about control and freedom) that could be tightened for greater impact. Some lines tilt toward purple or abstract (“fortified vulnerability,” “tapestry of resilience”) instead of grounding emotion in fresh sensory or situational specifics. Rhythm is sound but not especially distinctive at a sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose generally shows strong line-level craft: sensory specificity, varied sentence structure, and multi-function sentences that advance both atmosphere and character. There is some repetition of signature phrases (“vibrant hush,” “in the calm before realization”) and a few spots of near-purpling where abstractions pile up (“a guilt he had carried for years,” “redemption forged in the quiet spaces between regret and action”). Most metaphors are coherent and apt, though the density is occasionally high for the low-pressure moments. Overall momentum remains intact, but a rigorous edit could trim redundant or theme-telling lines.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong: precise images (acid sea, prismatic dance of the kaleidoscope) and clean syntax move the story forward without confusion. There is minor redundancy and occasional purple-leaning abstraction (“archaeology of the soul,” repeated “throughout the evolution”) that could be tightened. Information density is good, with most sentences doing multiple jobs of worldbuilding, mood, and action. No major loops or figurative muddles interfere with clarity or the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and mostly concise, with few true redundancies and a good density of information per sentence. Some phrases and images repeat in slightly varied form (“sensed absence,” “silence,” “ghosts,” “void”), which can feel a bit circular rather than progressively intensifying. Figurative language is apt but occasionally leans toward the generic-poetic, and several key insights are stated twice in adjacent lines. Line-level craft is solid and publishable in many venues but falls short of the sharpest, most economical literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and image-rich without tipping into full purple; phrases like “shadows curled like smoke” and “air feel thin” are effective and concrete. Sentences vary reasonably in length and structure, and most lines carry both atmosphere and narrative information. There is some mild abstraction/repetition (“mapping empathy onto action,” restating his calm intuition) but not enough to stall momentum or obscure sense. No major figurative muddles or scaffolding artifacts interfere with the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with smooth syntax, strong nouns/verbs, and a mostly steady rhythm; there are no major clarity issues or grammatical faults. Some sentences carry multiple jobs—setting, emotion, theme—without bloating. That said, the piece leans toward repetition and mild purple-lyric abstraction (“a fold in patience,” “windborne solace,” “gripped reality loosely” cycled several times), which can flatten momentum and feel slightly templated. Tightening redundant lines and varying imagery would lift the prose into a more precise, less self-conscious register.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with no major clarity failures. The prose carries some pleasing images, but it leans into repetition and mild purple tendencies, especially with recycled constructs (“by drawing parallels…,” “passionate subtlety,” “gently persuasive clarity”) and thematic restatement. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase one another conceptually rather than adding new pressure or detail, which gently erodes momentum. The closure image is still legible, but could be sharper and more compressed with tighter, less abstract language.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.5)
    Grammar and mechanics are clean, and individual sentences are mostly clear, but there is substantial paraphrase looping and diction redundancy (e.g., “whisperfield calm,” “peripheral awareness,” “echo of wisdom” recur with near-identical function). Many lines restate the same idea with slightly different wording, which dilutes momentum and information density. Syntax is highly uniform (subject-verb, similar clause lengths), giving the piece a droning cadence that undercuts its own images. Tightening repetition and varying rhythm would markedly improve line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and uses specific, sensory images effectively (bees humming, metallic tang of decay, children playing in the dust). Most sentences do more than one job, advancing atmosphere and theme simultaneously, and there are few genuine redundancies. At the same time, the line-level texture leans on familiar abstractions (“collective soul of the town,” “visual symphony,” “legacy of resilience and love”) that feel generic beside the stronger concrete details. Trimming these summary phrases and trusting the images would sharpen momentum and elevate the craft.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally fluent and evocative, with some strong images (hush thick with dust; crystal painting “auditory pictures”). Yet there are clear redundancies and occasional clunkers, such as “a massive, defunct chandelier hung like a skeletal chandelier,” and repeated motifs (“weathered innocence,” “suspended hush”) that become formulaic rather than intensifying. Modifiers and metaphors sometimes stack to the edge of purple, slightly slowing momentum. Line-level craft is competent but not ruthlessly pared or freshly precise enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished, with few if any clumsy constructions, and most sentences carry multiple jobs (advancing image, theme, and emotion together). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and on-theme (fog, echoes, tides, aging), creating a unified texture rather than a jumble of mixed metaphors. There is some conceptual redundancy—echoes, forgetting, and longing are named repeatedly in similar ways—so momentum occasionally softens instead of sharpening. Still, clarity remains high throughout, and the closing images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, grammatical, and purposeful; many lines carry dual loads of atmosphere and theme (“To capture the flare's entirety, the camera needed to break free from time's flow, just as a rocket escapes gravity”). However, there is noticeable repetition of certain abstractions and phrases (“luminous ache,” “changelessly constant,” “harnessing the ephemeral”) that verges on scaffold, and some sentences state what the surrounding images already imply. Figurative language remains coherent and non-muddled, but a slight tendency toward aphoristic phrasing and redundancy keeps this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level writing is clean and grammatically sound, with some pleasing images (clouds “like whispers,” fragments holding wholeness). The main weaknesses are repetition of key abstractions and a tendency to tell emotional states or thematic conclusions rather than compress them into fresh, concrete images. There’s mild purple shading in phrases like “scent of hope” and “pulsing stillness,” repeated enough to feel like scaffolding. Overall, the prose is competent and occasionally lyrical, but not yet sharpened to elite-density precision.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is clean, syntactically varied enough, and mostly free of clutter; sentences typically do more than one job (world-building plus character plus motion). A few phrases and constructions recur (“quietly deliberate,” explanatory clauses like “meaning…”), and there is some summarizing where scene could heighten immediacy, but these don’t seriously drag momentum. Figurative language is light and coherent, avoiding purple excess. Line-level craft is solidly publishable but not yet at a dazzling, high-density level.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally fluent and rhythmically controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information. Imagery—opalescent tooth, cleft in certainty, constellation of fireflies—is clear and often striking. Yet there is a noticeable density of elevated abstractions and thematic restatements that create mild redundancy and occasional purple overtones, especially near the ending. Tightening repeated ideas and trimming a few grand statements would sharpen impact without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean, generally clear, and often beautiful on the line, with some strong images (the glass as “purged of its oceanic burdens,” the cave’s silence as “a canvas for her introspection”). However, there is noticeable redundancy—ideas of weighing, stillness, mist, and gentle light recur with minimal new information—and some sentences accrete modifiers (“serpentine mist,” “reflectively vibrant,” “pearl of stillness”) to the point of mild overload. This produces a sense of slight overwriting and slows momentum in a piece that already relies on quiet interior shifts. Tightening loops and pruning a few decorative phrases would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is polished, with strong imagery and generally efficient sentences that each contribute to atmosphere, character, or theme. There is some tendency toward redundancy and explicit metaphor explanation, as in the cluster of “grafting,” “pruning,” “scar tissue,” and “mosaic” metaphors in close succession, which slightly blunts impact. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and grounded; it rarely lapses into true purple prose or mixed metaphors. Momentum is appropriately measured for a lyric piece, and clarity of action and emotional throughline is never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often sonorous, with some strong images (the shell warming, pulsing with hopes). Yet the density of modifiers and metaphors trends purple, and several sentences restate similar ideas (mist/hush/void/whisper) without adding new pressure or specificity. Cadence can feel monotonous due to similar sentence lengths and structures. Line-level craft is solid but would benefit from pruning and sharper, less generalized imagery at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clear, grammatically clean, and often pretty, with some effective images (“the world leaned in to listen,” the tendril curling as “keeper of golden stories”). At the same time, it leans into repetition and near-paraphrase (“remedy,” “alignment,” “golden stories,” “sacred practices” recur with similar phrasing) that slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is frequent but rarely strained; the issue is more accumulation than confusion, creating a soft, almost uniform texture. Trimming redundant sentences and varying rhythm would significantly sharpen its impact for high-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid imagery, clean syntax, and mostly efficient sentences that each add atmosphere or advance the ritual. There is some redundancy and mild purple-prose drift (recurring “moving stillness,” reiterated motivations and explanations) that could be tightened for greater impact. Figurative language is coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or outright muddle. Line-level control is solid but not razor-honed enough to feel fully publication-ready at a top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. There is some repetition of concepts and phrases (“wounded season,” cellar of reason, variations on echoes reflecting) that skirts paraphrase without quite becoming looped scaffolding. Imagery leans lush but rarely into outright purple, and syntax remains clear and readable throughout. Tighter pruning of near-duplicate lines, especially in the midsection describing methods, would heighten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and high-density, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. A few phrases verge on purple or abstract (“boundary-lessly trapped,” “pouch woven from starlight and intention”) and certain structures repeat (the repeated “After the first snowmelt” and similar cadences), which can feel slightly ornamental. Nonetheless, clarity is rarely compromised; action and sequence are easy to track. There’s little scaffolding or synonym-churn, and the final images land crisply.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and rhythmically smooth, with some effective sensory layering (rain, wood, light). There are noticeable paraphrase/idea loops—“harvest lessons from loss,” “crystallized time,” “hauntingly practical,” “contain them”—that repeat without always adding new pressure or nuance. A few lines tip toward purple or explanatory, particularly where theme is spelled out, but clarity remains intact. Overall information density is decent, yet tightening repetition and abstract phrasing would raise momentum and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is smooth and readable, with few outright clunky lines and a decent balance of sentence lengths. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent, though some metaphors are familiar or slightly redundant, contributing mild purple overtones. There are a few conceptual repeats (ambitions eroding, fractured stillness, chronologically confused) that could be tightened. Information density is good, and momentum holds, but the language lacks the precision and surprise expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is clean, syntactically varied, and usually economical; most sentences carry at least two jobs (image + theme, or action + interiority). Some phrases and concepts recur a bit mechanically (“maze of intentions,” “redirected flows,” “stoic wonder”), and a few lines summarize what’s already dramatized, slightly dulling momentum. The final paragraph in particular leans on abstraction (“engage with the world’s complexities”) instead of a concrete culminating image. Still, there are no major artifacts, and line-level craft is solidly above average.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid imagery and varied sentence structures that support a slow, contemplative rhythm. Information density is high—most lines do double duty for mood and character—but there are clear signs of overwriting: stacked modifiers (“glacial hush,” “hidden sunrise,” “petrichor nostalgia”) and repeated adjectives (“excruciatingly gentle” four times) create a slight purple sheen and minor redundancy. Some phrases could be pared without loss to clarity or resonance. Despite this, clarity and momentum are not seriously harmed, and the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and generally clear, with some striking phrases (“the serene upheaval of this dawn,” “the silence of the morning radio was a blanket”). Yet there is noticeable repetition of key abstract terms and structures, giving a slight sense of scaffolding and paraphrase loops. Many sentences tell us about realizations rather than dramatizing them through fresh, concrete detail. Overall momentum survives, but the language rarely surprises or compresses multiple functions in a single, charged line.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is mostly clear and fluid, with strong sensory images and only occasional repetition or padding. Figurative language (“oceanic hush,” “lightning-born form”) is generally apt, though the cumulative effect edges toward purple in places without always adding pressure. A few sentences restate similar ideas about patience, preservation, and weaving without deepening them, which slightly dulls momentum. Still, grammar and rhythm are controlled, and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and often graceful, with strong images like “autumn leaves fell like forgotten memories” and the thread pulling light from shadows. Some lines veer toward purple or redundant, repeating concepts (“lonesome splendor,” “geography of healing,” variants of “absences explained”) without adding new pressure. Rhythm is readable but leans on similar sentence structures, which slightly dulls momentum. Still, clarity is maintained and there are no major artifacts or figurative muddles.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.0)
    Several sentences have strong, memorable imagery (“stalactites that dripped with the memory of water”), and the prose is mostly clear and grammatically sound. That said, there is noticeable scaffold and synonym looping—ideas like flawed genesis, bitter sweetness, mechanized sterility, and hypothesizing are reiterated with minimal new information. Sentence structures and paragraph rhythms are relatively uniform, which flattens momentum in what should be high-pressure beats. Overall, the line-level work is serviceable with flashes of beauty but lacks the compression and precision demanded at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally strong: vivid images, varied sentence rhythms, and solid information density where description often doubles as thematic work. Some imagery edges toward purple or repetitive (clouds as herds, lapping water, multiple invocations of peace and calm), but it remains coherent rather than muddled. There are few, if any, true scaffold or synonym loops; most lines move character, setting, or theme forward. Tightening a handful of overtly declarative lines and trimming one or two descriptive redundancies would bring it to a very high tier.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and imagistic, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., the box panels as dead constellations that later realign with the revived sky). There is some repetition of favored abstractions (“sidereal patience,” “defiant hush,” luminous imagery) that edges toward over-patterning but doesn’t quite stall momentum. Figurative language is mostly coherent and grounded; only occasionally does density flirt with excess. Overall, sentences carry good information density and forward motion, but a light pruning would sharpen impact for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is largely strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with figurative language that usually clarifies rather than muddies. Key motifs (“quiet sigh of falling petals,” “approximated infinity”) recur in a way that builds pattern. However, a few phrases are reused almost verbatim without added pressure, creating mild paraphrase-loop feel and a hint of purple repetition. Line-level control is good enough for high-tier venues but not so immaculate that no tightening is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is clean and mostly clear, with a smooth rhythm and a few strong images (the ghost “shimmering like heat haze,” monarchs as “airborne dance”). At the same time, there is noticeable repetition and abstraction—many sentences summarize interior states or insights instead of dramatizing them, and key thematic lines verge on purple or redundant. Figurative language clusters (“network,” “woven,” “fabric”) are conceptually aligned but occasionally feel overexplained. Line-level craft is solid but not sharp enough for immediate top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean, easy to follow, and maintains a consistent, gently lyrical cadence. However, it relies on repeated abstractions and formulations (“incremental absolution,” “shared balance,” “searing reverie,” “ethically diligent”) that create a sense of scaffold and reduce information density. Sentence rhythms and paragraph moves feel somewhat templated, with many lines summarizing interior states rather than advancing them through fresh image or action. Despite this, clarity and basic momentum are preserved, and no figurative muddle obstructs closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with a steady rhythm appropriate to a contemplative, atmospheric piece. Certain phrases and concepts (“uncharted echoes,” “velveteen gloom,” “tenderly organized”) recur, but they stop short of true synonym loops or scaffold bloat. Figurative language is fairly restrained and tends toward clarity rather than muddle, though it leans a bit on a familiar, slightly purple gothic lexicon. Line-level craft is solidly professional but not yet compressed or surprising enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with some excellent lines (e.g., the lake cracking and thawing in response to his writing). Information density is high, and most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and concept. However, there is noticeable abstraction and repetition of similar ideas (“predictive models,” “constraints,” “seeding innovation”) that could be pruned or made more concrete, edging toward mild overwriting. A bit more variance in texture and more grounded sensory detail under peak beats would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant and rhythmic, with many lines doing double duty for mood and information. Some abstractions (“infusing it with the essence,” “half-remembered lore”) and mild repetition slightly blunt immediacy, but they don’t obscure sense. Figurative language is mostly coherent and on-theme, though it sometimes leans toward the generalized rather than the sharply concrete. Line-level craft is strong enough for publication, but a light tightening could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, well-paced, and often do double duty with image and meaning (e.g., resin “of regret and hope”). There is some conceptual and syntactic repetition (“somber marvel,” “crystallize a fleeting emotion,” explicit restatements of method and motivation) that could be pared without loss, indicating mild scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. The final paragraphs, in particular, land cleanly without artifact noise.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, and many sentences carry more than one function (worldbuilding plus theme, for instance). At the same time, there are noticeable paraphrase and diction loops—particularly around “agonized,” “rationally rebellious,” “abrasive calm,” and “competing narratives”—that dilute momentum and information density. Much emotion is carried in abstract nouns and labels instead of fresh, concrete images, which keeps the line-level from feeling sharp. Nothing crucial is obscured, but the stylistic repetition and conceptual telling would need tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms, strong sensory verbs, and relatively high information density. Motifs (autumn, stillness, braiding, subtracting noise) recur in a mostly controlled way, though some phrases verge on repetition and mild purple (“vanishing arts,” “traveled stillness,” moral-lesson formulations). There are few, if any, genuine artifacts or syntactic glitches; momentum is maintained despite the reflective mode. Tightening a few redundant thematic restatements could further sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally striking, but it leans heavily on repetition and explanatory scaffolding. Concepts like “synaptic plasticity,” “gentle rebellion,” and “create something beautiful from the ruins” are reiterated without adding new texture, creating paraphrase loops. Figurative language is serviceable yet sometimes generic or over-explicit, and many sentences do only one job instead of layering function. This flattens momentum and weakens the impact of the otherwise strong closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and generally concise; most sentences advance either image, world, or emotional frame. There is some repetition of key words and ideas (“wonder,” “nectar-dusk,” the box’s purpose) that edges toward redundant, especially in the final third. Figurative language is mostly controlled and coherent, though a few phrases feel slightly stock (“like a precious flame,” “made life worth living”). Overall momentum holds, but trimming a few summarizing lines in the closing paragraphs would tighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    The line-level writing is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with a strong sense of atmosphere and few outright clunkers. Some redundancy and scaffold creep in—several sentences paraphrase the same insight about displaced objects sanctifying spaces, and “hush/blaze” motifs are reiterated instead of developed. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent; it occasionally risks purple (“streetlights’ glow created a hushed blaze”) without adding new nuance. Tightening repetition and trimming overt explanation would appreciably sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly economical; sentences usually carry multiple functions (world-building plus theme) without obvious clutter. There are some paraphrase tendencies and conceptual repetitions, especially in the closing stretch, where similar insights are restated with slightly different wording. Figurative language is largely coherent, but leans heavily on familiar abstractions rather than fresh, sensory-rooted images. Rhythm is serviceable rather than striking, but it keeps momentum without major stalls or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and grammatical, with a readable rhythm and few outright stumbles. However, there is noticeable repetition of key abstractions (texture, opportunity, perpetual motion, boundless confinement) and a tendency toward paraphrased insight, which introduces mild redundancy and sap momentum. Figurative language is competent but often generic or explanatory rather than surprising. Line-level tightening—especially in the reflective concluding third—would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-dense without becoming incoherent; sentences typically do double duty with atmosphere and thematic work. Repetition of certain phrases and structures is present but not so heavy as to feel like scaffolding or loops, and the metaphors remain internally consistent. Line-level clarity holds even in more figurative moments, and the final images land crisply. The main constraint on a higher score is that the diction occasionally leans toward the abstract and could benefit from a few more concretely embodied beats under emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density—most sentences carry character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Metaphoric language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There are mild brushes with purple (e.g., “a funeral bouquet for a lost tradition”), yet they remain intelligible and consistent with the story’s aesthetic. Little to no scaffolding or redundancy appears, and the final paragraph lands on a clean, resonant cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong information density: many sentences advance atmosphere, worldbuilding, and theme at once. Metaphoric language is generally clean and coherent (e.g., the island “breathing,” time as a “loom”), and there are few to no scaffold or paraphrase loops. Some repetition of phrases like “latent radiance” and occasional near-purple constructions slightly risk over-saturation but stay just this side of controlled lyricism. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum from discovery through climax to the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, with vivid but not overwhelmingly dense figurative language (“paint peeling like sunburnt skin,” “tomb of forgotten laughter,” “a hunger made visible”). Most lines perform multiple functions—advancing plot while deepening mood or character—which keeps momentum high. There are few, if any, scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and the closing paragraphs land cleanly without purple excess. A touch of abstraction in the thematic statements is the only notable soft spot, but it doesn’t materially dull the prose’s clarity or force.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly clear, with good rhythmic variation, and many do double duty for image and concept (“a fragile, luminous dome between day and night” efficiently sets tone and time). Some phrases and concepts recur a bit heavily (“fractal,” “resonance,” “euphony”), nudging toward purple and slight redundancy without adding new pressure. There are no obvious syntactic stumbles or confusing images, and the climax reads cleanly. A modest tightening of repeated metaphors would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, with high information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and character at once. Figurative language is purposeful and not overstacked, and there are few if any true loops or scaffolding sentences; rhythm varies enough to avoid a mechanical feel. A couple of moments edge toward abstraction or redundancy (“sunwashed dread,” “seed planted in the cracked earth of their old fears”) but they don’t materially dull the closure image. Grammar and sequencing are clean, so momentum stays intact despite the reflective tone.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and mostly well-paced, with a smooth read-aloud rhythm and no major artifacts or loops. Some lines paraphrase each other (“rescue truth from a pit of lies” / “strip away the layers of deliberate falsehood”) and conceptual phrasing appears where sharper concrete detail could carry weight. Figurative language is controlled and not overwrought, though occasionally on-the-nose. The prose is solidly serviceable but could be tightened and made more texturally distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with many sentences doing double-duty for atmosphere and character, and images like the inkwell as “a small, heavy anchor in the drifting world” are memorable. There is some overwriting and repetition (“wrest meaning from the silence, to pull coherence from the void”; “wrested these stories from the void”), and density of metaphor occasionally edges toward purple. Still, clarity and momentum are generally preserved and the closure image is clean. A light line edit for redundancy and intensifier trimming would align it with top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with clear syntax, logical sequencing, and good information density; almost every sentence contributes to atmosphere, process, or thematic development. Yet there is noticeable repetition of key abstractions (“reclaimed stillness,” “dappled resolve,” “alternative hypothesis,” “honest origins”), and some sentences paraphrase prior ideas in slightly different words without adding pressure. Figurative language occasionally leans purple or conceptual rather than concrete. These mild artifacts reduce propulsion and keep the prose from feeling razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clear and efficient, with strong images like “dream orbs floated like captive fireflies” and “paper wings glowing with soft, internal light.” There is a tendency toward conceptual repetition and mild purple prose (“luminous torment,” “brilliant, painful clarity,” multiple restatements of grief-to-hope) that dilutes impact without obscuring meaning. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to keep momentum, and there are no major grammatical or structural slips. Tightening redundancy and trusting concrete moments over conceptual phrases would markedly elevate the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally tight and controlled, with strong images doing multiple jobs (the geode as both personal relic and experimental tool, the fire-bloom wedding as both memory and inciting trauma). Line-level rhythm varies well, and there is little scaffolding or redundancy; the paragraphs mostly carry new pressure or insight. Some formulations lean toward purple or conceptual (“intangible tangible,” “terrible, luminous clarity”), and the climactic knowledge dump is more told than shown, but these do not materially obscure causality or closure. Overall, information density and readability are high, with only minor tendencies toward abstract overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.0)
    The lines are grammatically clean, and the sequence of actions is generally clear, with a steady if gentle momentum. However, there is noticeable repetition of phrases and concepts (“brilliant dimness,” “missing pieces,” “frequency of belonging,” “following star trails”) that sometimes restate rather than deepen. Several sentences operate as scaffolding or thematic summary, especially in the final third, softening impact and edging toward sentimental abstraction. More compression and fresher, concrete phrasing at key beats would sharpen the piece considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are generally clean, varied, and purposeful, with strong control of rhythm and few syntactic or clarity issues. The prose often does double duty—advancing narrative while shading theme—but leans on abstract nouns and repeated constructions about “weight,” “burden,” “truth,” and “regret,” causing some mild redundancy. A few lines paraphrase nearby content (e.g., reasserting how guilt gnaws and burdens) instead of adding new pressure or image. It’s solidly publishable line work but not yet at the taut, stripped precision of top-tier pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is clean, with few if any grammatical issues and a generally good sense of cadence. Some metaphors (“furrowed hush,” “mist parting like a curtain”) are effective, though a couple of phrases and ideas repeat in slightly different wording, edging toward redundancy. The prose occasionally leans into abstract summary (“Her uncommonly thoughtful nature had turned the tide”) when a more concrete image could do the work. Overall momentum holds, but the language could be tightened further to shed mild sentimental and explanatory scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentence-level craft is clear and grammatically solid, with straightforward sequencing and no confusion about physical action. That said, there’s notable redundancy—motifs and phrases recur with minimal development (“backlash of regrets,” “merrily melancholic,” and “to align heart and action” are reiterated rather than deepened). Information density is adequate but not taut; several sentences restate emotional states instead of layering new texture. Rhythm and syntax are serviceable but a bit monotonous, lacking the compression and surprise expected at top-tier markets.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and consistently clear, with straightforward sequencing and no serious confusion at the line level. However, there is a noticeable reliance on familiar metaphors and abstractions (“barren soil of his heart,” “simple truths,” “kindle empathy”), as well as paraphrase-like repetitions of the same ideas across adjacent sentences. Many sentences share similar structures and beats (“He [verb]…”), leading to a mild drumbeat cadence. While this doesn’t break the story, it keeps the language from feeling lean, surprising, or maximally efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is generally polished, with evocative metaphors and efficient rhythms that carry momentum through what is essentially a single extended ritual. The sequence of spice descriptions is especially strong, doing double duty as atmosphere and magical mechanism. There is some over-reliance on similar abstract formulations (“cosmic intimacy,” “eternal bond,” “cycles of life and beyond”) and a bit of thematic restatement that could be cut for greater sharpness. Nonetheless, clarity is never in doubt, and most sentences contribute meaningfully to mood or progression.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and theme) and the scene reads cleanly with no syntactic confusion. However, the prose leans toward density—frequent metaphors and stacked modifiers (“choking beauty,” “cloudbound repentance,” “drowning in stars”) create a persistent lushness that sometimes blurs edge and momentum. There are mild paraphrase and emphasis loops around regret and lost time that could be tightened without cost. Still, clarity holds, the closure image is sharp, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and economical yet vivid imagery (“crystalline traces of a final, desperate cry,” “a profound, welcoming silence”). Key motifs—shimmer, stitching, light—are repeated just enough to feel patterned rather than redundant. Occasionally the language skirts purple or conceptual abstraction, but it doesn’t obscure causality or dull the closure image. Line-level momentum is steady, with few to no scaffold sentences or obvious loops.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and largely clear, with some strong images (lightning bugs “like tiny heartbeats,” light on dark sand). Yet there is significant conceptual repetition—sentences and even full lines restate transformation insights in slightly different wording, which blunts momentum. Figurative language leans on familiar binaries (light/dark, ending/beginning) without much fresh torque, and several late paragraphs summarize emotional conclusions instead of embodying them. Line-level craft is solid but not sharply economical or layered enough for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often vivid (“walls humming with a soft, internal radiance”), and key objects are clearly handled. Yet there is significant repetition of ideas and phrases across adjacent sentences and paragraphs—especially around the blackout, silent revolution, and cradle of sparks—that operates as paraphrase loops rather than deepening. Some lines restate the same stakes in slightly different words, slowing momentum in the back half. Figurative language is generally coherent but occasionally tips toward cliché (“pregnant pause,” “spread like wildfire”).

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, syntactically varied, and momentum-preserving; most sentences carry both image and narrative function. Some images and phrases recur in ways that edge toward purple or redundant (“shimmering,” “borrowed dawn,” generalized cosmic language), but they don’t obscure causality or the closure beat. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the line-by-line rhythm supports rather than drags the scene. It’s strong, publishable prose that could benefit from a light tightening of repeated motifs and modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatically clean, and rhythmically smooth enough to read without stumbling. Some images are strong (glass dome trembling, scars as constellations), and most sentences carry at least one job of mood or information. However, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases (vigil, masks slipping, storm-kissed wonder, rarefy) in ways that feel more like prompt adherence than organic echo, and several sentences paraphrase each other’s ideas. The figurative and declarative density in the climax leans toward slight overstatement, which blunts impact rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally clear and fluent, with solid sentence variety and no major grammatical issues; key actions are easy to follow. At times, figurative language stacks into mild purple (“hidden overture beckoned from the sundial's coded angles, a geometric sonata”) and some phrases repeat conceptually (“dignified chaos,” “transform the enigma of existence”), creating a sense of thematic telling rather than compressed image-work. There is minor redundancy in summarizing what images already imply, but no severe loops or artifacts that obscure causality. Overall, it’s readable and occasionally vivid, though in need of tightening for high-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: clean syntax, few redundancies, and a good balance of image and clarity. Some phrases edge toward purple or conceptual redundancy (“luminous fracture,” “incandescent possibility,” explicit restatements of the same idea), but they don’t obscure sense or closure. Information density is solid—the piece mostly avoids scaffolding and tells background efficiently. A touch more variation in sentence rhythm and a slight pruning of abstracted phrases could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally fluent and image-rich—“sky bled from silver to deep orange,” “path of solid light,” “temporary sanctuary woven from memory and light” carry both atmosphere and function. Line-level clarity is strong; causal sequences are easy to follow, and there are few if any syntactic or grammatical slips. There is mild repetition of key nouns and some abstract phrasing (“steely longing,” “strategic creativity”) that could be sharpened into more concrete, character-specific language, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum. Figurative language is present but not so stacked as to feel overwrought or obscure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with straightforward syntax that keeps events legible. However, there is heavy reliance on simple declarative sentences and paraphrase loops—many late lines restate that the memory is safe, the duty fulfilled, the ridge will bloom again, etc., without adding new pressure or image. Key coined phrases (“empirically whimsical,” “luminous doubt”) recur without deepening, creating a sense of lexical rather than conceptual repetition. The line-level craft is functional but lacks compression, variety, and surprise; momentum in the final third noticeably flattens.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    The language is generally clear and fluid, with some strong images (“cerulean waters,” “texture of history and guidance”) doing double duty for mood and theme. There is a mild tendency toward abstraction and repeated phrasing (“rhythmically placid,” explicit re-mention of cerulean regret) that slightly blunts momentum but doesn’t seriously obscure meaning. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense or mixed that it becomes purple or confusing. Line-level tightening—paring back explanatory sentences and a few near-duplicate ideas—would move this closer to elite polish.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose opens with a cliché ("shattered dreams") and leans heavily on abstract noun phrases ("unimaginable density," "grand conclusions") that reduce immediacy. The writing tells the reader what to feel rather than showing the physical reality that prompts the feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is laden with purple abstractions and forced phrasing ("harmonic emptiness," "drifting resonance"). Key phrases are repeated to the point of becoming artifacts ("patterns," "scorched testament"). The density of abstract nouns suffocates the concrete action, and the line-level logic often drifts into non-sequitur comparisons.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant repetitive looping occurs with prompt phrases ("unshaken marvels" appears four times; "rectify" four times), creating a mechanical rhythm. The prose is dense with adjectives and filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt"), which dulls the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is grammatically clean but suffers from low information density due to the reliance on summary and abstract nouns. Sentences function largely as scaffolding to move the plot forward ("He packed his few tools," "Finally, when the last piece was set"). There is little rhythmic variety to match the intended tension.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("heavy as the humid night air," "eyes bright with gratitude") and repetitive phrasing. Required elements appear as awkward labels ("gently persistent") or repetitive text artifacts ("amplified quiet") rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is overwritten and adjective-heavy ("profound, spiritually curious yearning," "full, fragrant bloom"), reducing narrative momentum. There is a reliance on abstract nouns and telling, with key moments filtered through weak phrasing ("nature compelled her") rather than strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is dense with abstract metaphors and "of" constructions ("texture of time," "geometry of hope") that clutter the imagery. This reliance on poetic abstraction over concrete sensory detail weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition artifacts degrade the prose; the phrase "staggering grace" is pasted in four times, and "impede" appears three times in clumsy constructions. The writing feels like a checklist of prompt words glued together without rhythmic variation or lexical care.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose suffers from telling over showing, frequently explaining the meaning of images immediately after presenting them. Phrasing is often repetitive or cliched ("clung like salt," "tasted of regret"), and the reliance on abstract noun constructions creates distance rather than immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetition artifacts drag the score down; the phrase "luminous disbelief" appears three times, "reinterpret" three times, and "quietly savvy" twice. These blatant loops suggest a checklist approach that disrupts the prose rhythm and narrative immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is weighed down by telling ("dramatically narrating," "simple yet profound") and oxymoronic abstractions ("weighty lightness"). Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a "Description, explanation of meaning" pattern that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.3)
    Prose is overwrought with abstract nouns and adjective-heavy descriptions ("faint, sibilant urgings", "trembling certainty"). The phrase "firmly adaptive" is inserted awkwardly into the sentence structure, disrupting the rhythm. The writing tells rather than shows, relying on summary to advance the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of prompt phrases ("summarizing silence" x4, "hush" x4, "retell" x4) which creates a mechanical, looping rhythm. Abstract nouns ("essence," "void," "patterns") crowd out concrete imagery. The density of "tell" statements stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is polished but reliant on summary and abstract nouns ("vibration," "tapestry," "essence") rather than concrete sensory details. There are minor repetitive artifacts (using "remarkably composed" twice) and a tendency to tell the reader what is happening ("aiming to amalgamate") rather than showing the process.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases ("ambiguously clear," "resonant hush," "words became unnecessary") creates a mechanical, scaffolded rhythm. These phrases appear 3–5 times each in a short space, reading as a checklist rather than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is severely marred by the mechanical repetition of multi-word phrases ("blooming withering," "mended deception," "wisely pragmatic") which appear 3-4 times each in a short text. This creates a "checklist" effect that destroys narrative flow and creates significant text artifacts. The reliance on telling over showing further weakens the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.1)
    Grammar and flow are competent, but the prose suffers from adjective clutter ("soft, mechanically warm glow," "complex, shimmering model") and lacks muscular verbs. The repetition of "mechanically warm" and "icy warmth" feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.6)
    Prose is functional but marred by awkward phrasing ("She was lately inspired by") and repetitive sentence structures ("She [verb]"). The writing relies on "telling" ("Her motivation was singular") where scene work is needed to generate momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is marred by repetitive usage of prompt phrases (e.g., "auroral sorrow," "swallowed truth" appear multiple times) and relying on clichés ("spat erratic numbers," "painted the sky"). These artifacts create a loop-like quality that dulls the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by adjective-heavy telling ("reckless disregard," "profound mass") and passive constructions. The pacing drags during the radio sequence, where expository backstory halts the immediate momentum of the tunnel scene.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.9)
    Flow is disrupted by the repetitive insertion of stock phrases ("regenerative silence," "crumbling peace") and a checklist-style conclusion. Abstract nouns often crowd out concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=2.2)
    Line-level craft is severely impacted by artifact loops; the phrase "beneath the hush of dreaming roots" appears seven times, acting as a forced refrain that stops momentum. Adjective-noun pairings are repetitive and abstract ("careful joy," "quiet spring," "peaceful silence"). The reliance on "telling" over "showing" renders the prose dense with summary but light on immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.4)
    Phrasing is often clunky ("Using these as his method") or reliant on clichés ("brittle as autumn leaves," "heart beat a rhythm"). The insertion of the prompt attribute "sensitively perceptive" is syntactically awkward and violates the show-don't-tell principle. The repetition of "bronze quiet" feels mechanical rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.0)
    The prose is severely marred by the repetitive, unintegrated pasting of prompt strings ("after last orders," "transpose life," "orchestrate"), creating a disjointed and artificial rhythm. The reliance on abstract summary over concrete imagery prevents any immersion or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is marred by severe repetitive phrasing within a short word count; "unraveled stillness" appears four times, and "plumb/plumbed," "decorated," and "muffled clarity" are cycled repeatedly. The reliance on abstract nouns ("possibility," "truth," "concept") creates a dense, opaque texture that obscures the action. These artifacts signal a lack of lexical control and significantly drag on the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from severe template cadence ("She picked," "She transposed," "She connected," "She recalled"), creating a monotonous rhythm. Repetitive use of specific phrases like "upturned hush" (3x) and "chronologically homesick" (3x) reads as forced insertion. High density of filter verbs ("She felt," "She sensed") distances the reader from the sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is weighed down by adjectivitis ("rain-slicked," "ancient," "faint, rhythmic") and passive constructions. The use of "darkening brightness" as a descriptor is clunky and confusing. Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a "He [verb]... He [saw]..." pattern that creates a mechanical rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from a high density of abstract nouns and purple phrasing ("filament of hush," "reawakening," "patterns of feeling"). "Audibly muted" is used clumsily ("audibly muted performance"). The text relies on clichés ("crucible of healing," "thawing the ice") instead of fresh, concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose relies heavily on "telling" rather than "showing" (e.g., "methodical mind pieced together"), distancing the reader from the action. Repetitive sentence structures (Noun-Verb openings) and the forced repetition of specific phrases ("layered tranquility," "intuit") create a mechanical cadence. Causality often occurs in summary within the narration rather than in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is mechanically functional but weighed down by abstract nouns ("oblivion," "composure," "legacy") and purple phrasing ("ultraviolet truth"). The insertion of prompt phrases like "aromatically cautious" feels awkward and label-heavy rather than organic to the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from a high density of stative verbs ("It was a time," "He was a man," "This action... was his method") and abstract nouns that dilute imagery. Clichéd phrasing ("sound without mirth") and "tell" constructions weaken the line-level momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by abstract "telling" and diagnostic phasing ("She found a magnificent simplicity"). "Unbinded" reads as a usage error (standard: "unbound") or an awkward neologism without sufficient context. The repetition of key phrases ("magnificent simplicity," "chronic hush") feels like a scaffold rather than a motif, and the rhythm is often monotonous due to a lack of syntactic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=3.0)
    A significant structural loop ("As the transformation completed") repeats three times, acting as a mechanical crutch that disrupts flow. The prose is weighed down by abstract nouns and "telling," lacking the density and propulsion required for professional publication.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.1)
    While grammatically functional, the prose relies heavily on abstract telling ("initiated an investigation," "unfolded with cautious exuberance"). Clichéd phrasing ("eyes misty with memory," "beacon," "void") replaces concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive artifacts, with prompt phrases ("boldly sympathetic," "luminescent ache," "webs of kinship") each repeated three times in a short text, creating a scaffolded feel. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("shimmering crater," "pliant reeds," "radiant sense") reduces information density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from severe syntactic monotony, with nearly every sentence following a "Subject-Verb-Object" or "Subject-Verb" pattern (Template Cadence). This creates a droning rhythm that saps momentum from the climax. Phrasing is often repetitive ("sculpting time," "borrowing time") and functional, lacking the density required for this band.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases ("gently inventive" x4, "dovetail" x3, "ambiguous loss" x3) creates a mechanical, checklist texture. These insertions disrupt prose rhythm and result in awkward syntactic constructions like "dovetail action."

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers severely from "keyword stuffing," where specific phrases ("ferromagnetic tape reel fragment," "kindly methodical," "sapphire hush") are repeated verbatim multiple times, creating a robotic, checklist-like rhythm. These artifacts disrupt flow and destroy immersion, reducing the narrative to a mechanical exercise in including prompt elements.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is competent and clear, but marred by the awkward, verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("circuitously sincere," "sustaining transformation") that disrupts the rhythm. There is a reliance on filter verbs ("she realized," "she saw how") that distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("wryly earnest," "thresh meaning from experience," "haggard awe"), which appear twice each as conspicuous artifacts. This repetition creates a mechanical feel and breaks immersion, suggesting a checklist approach rather than integrated craft.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by adjective clutter ("strange, persistent fog," "spontaneous, joyful symphony") and filter verbs ("recognized," "realized," "felt"). Phrasing is often abstract, using oxymorons like "bright darkness" as substitutes for precise description. The required phrase "steadily unpredictable" is integrated awkwardly, disrupting the rhythm of the sentences it inhabits.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.6)
    Prose is weighed down by "scaffold" sentences that explain intent ("She was driven by a singular motivation," "Her method would be through..."). The integration of prompt phrases is clunky and mechanical, disrupting rhythm. Figurative language is often trite ("ended not with a bang") or abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from heavy reliance on abstract nouns and "tell-y" adjectives ("analytically artistic," "pulsing truth"). "Frozen tears that lined the walls" and similar phrases lean into cliché and purple prose, while sentence structures remain repetitive and declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from adjective stuffing ("brittle scroll," "haunting calls," "tapestry," "brave compassion") and abstract nouns that dull the imagery. Sentences often function as scaffolding to explain the plot rather than evoking it. The rhythm is monotonous, lacking the variation needed to build tension.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition of key phrases constitutes a major craft flaw; "spatial mutiny" appears four times, "intrigue" four times, and "hushed thunder" three times in a short text. These loops create a mechanical template feel, reducing the prose's momentum and freshness. The reliance on abstract nouns and adjectives ("profound intrigue," "palpable tension") further dilutes line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by oxymoronic clichés ("deathly vitality," "waited actively") and mixed metaphors ("tone shifting from stone to stream"). Crucial moments are summarized with abstract nouns ("equations... unfolded") rather than shown through concrete observation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.9)
    Repetitive sentence structures (subject-verb openings like "He moved," "He carried," "He waited") create a monotone template cadence, and the prose often tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with evocative phrasing ("drifting ash," "palimpsest of a life") that establishes a strong mood. While occasionally adjectival, the line-level craft is solid and propels the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of required phrases ("resonant hums" x6, "gloomy cheerfulness" x3, "ephemeral compass" x4), creating a mechanical, algorithmic texture. Clichés like "the wind howled" further weaken the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is functional but leans on abstract emotional descriptors ("hopeful desperation" is used twice) and clichés ("silent war," "imposing shadows") instead of concrete imagery. The reliance on explaining the significance of actions ("It was a tangible link to the past") rather than showing their impact slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from "telling" emotions and traits directly ("dawnlit melancholy," "purposefully curious") rather than showing them. Adjective/adverb clutter ("purposefully," "profound," "iridescent," "palpable") slows the rhythm and reduces impact. The text relies on abstract nouns ("legacy," "despair," "isolation") where concrete details are needed.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("ghostly shroud," "harmonious dance") and filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew"), which flatten the narrative into summary rather than active scene.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.8)
    Line-level execution is marred by abstract phrasing ("insight and instance") and reliance on adverbs ("subtly confident," "focused intensity"). A notable grammatical error ("Elias's subtly confidence solidified") disrupts reading flow. The prose frequently tells the reader how to feel rather than evoking the sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive looping, with "wild hush" appearing four times and "infinitely patient" and "shared balance" three times each in a short text. The writing relies on filter verbs ("He felt," "He knew") and abstract summaries, lacking the density and variation required for literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is marred by clunky, passive sentence structures used to house constraints (e.g., "He was the sender of a desperate distress signal"). "Telling" dominates over "showing," and the repetition of the phrase "lonesome splendor" feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose quality is marred by clunky syntax required to fit specific elements ("hummed with the action of hover"), creating visible seams. Over-reliance on stock abstract metaphors ("pulse with secrets," "tapestry of distrust") reduces information density and vividness.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is heavily filtered ("He saw," "He felt," "He remembered") and relies on adverbs and abstract nouns to do the work of description ("lovingly venomous," "mournful elation"). Clichés abound ("flood his mind," "ice and fire," "cut short by tragedy"), and the prompt phrases are pasted in awkwardly as expository sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns and "telling" summaries ("This tone permeated the air") rather than concrete imagery. Sentences often follow a repetitive structure that explains the significance of actions instead of dramatizing the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from high density of filter verbs and clichés ("days that bled into weeks," "roots snaking"). The repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("purposeful wandering," "warmly curious") creates a mechanical, scaffolded rhythm that disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from clichéd phrasing ("Dawn broke," "deep-seated need") and repetitive insertion of prompt keywords ("carefully inventive," "juxtapose," "futuristic nostalgia") that disrupt flow. Adverb-heavy telling replaces concrete showing throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant cliché usage ("coiled like vipers," "skittered") and overwrought phrasing. The final sentence creates a mixed metaphor ("darkness that was louder than any scream") that strains the closure image, triggering a penalty for artifacts in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from cliché ("eyes that saw beyond the veil") and repetitive scaffolding ("She [verb]" sentence starts). The "unsent letters" motif is restated mechanically multiple times, and the recurring insertion of the phrase "fierce tenderness" feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of key phrases ("shrewdly innocent" and "lotus-hearted ache" both appear twice in a short span), reading as a checklist rather than organic description. The text relies on abstract nominalizations ("collective fear," "gentle warmth") and high-density adjectival strings that slow momentum. The repetition triggers the text-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density and noun-adjective pairing ("vivid mural artist," "damp, crumbling walls," "stark contrast"), creating a breathless, purple texture. Several phrases are clichés ("distant as the sun," "bleached bones") that dull the imagery's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe repetitive artifacts mar the prose; "methodically playful" appears three times, and "nested awakenings" four times in a short text. The prose relies heavily on abstract filter verbs ("felt," "perceived," "sensed") and flowery descriptors ("bewitching," "enchantment").

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from frequent "telling" ("Her method was ingenious," "unwitting ally") and adjective clutter that slows momentum. Clichés ("broken record," "standing her ground") and abstract nouns ("chaos," "defiance") replace concrete imagery, and the "template cadence" (Adjective Noun Verb Adjective Noun) becomes repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=1.5)
    The prose suffers severely from loop artifacts and scaffolding, with specific phrases ("shyly unstoppable," "ensconce," "reef-shadow joy," "off-key wind") repeated verbatim 3-4 times in a short space. This repetition creates a robotic, checklist-like texture that obscures any potential lyricism and prevents immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition artifacts degrade the prose; "gently systematic" (4x), "foxglove regret" (3x), and "long-forgotten song" (3x) appear verbatim throughout. This distinct looping of multi-word phrases creates a template cadence that reads as checklist-filling rather than narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose relies on clichés ("tangled web," "paths diverged irrevocably") and oxymoronic labels ("carefully reckless abandon") that clutter the sentences. Abstract descriptors replace concrete imagery, and the repetition of prompt phrases feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.9)
    Line-level craft is marred by abstract noun-adjective pairings and awkward insertions of prompt phrases ("slyly heartfelt," "dappled resolve") that disrupt syntactic rhythm. The prose often "tells" the reader what is happening ("ingenious mind devised a plan") rather than showing the specific mechanical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("shattered her world," "flower blooming in a withered garden," "web of communication") and abstract summaries. The high density of stock phrases and the lack of concrete, specific imagery prevents the writing from achieving literary traction.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("intuit" is used repeatedly as a catch-all for action) and awkward adjectival clusters like "featherly determined." The reliance on abstract nouns ("fractured hush," "chaos," "awe") creates a vague, dense texture without sensory precision.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is cluttered with abstract adjective-noun pairs ("softly ingenious methods," "luminous respite") that obscure clarity. The text relies on telling over showing, leading to low information density and a lack of propulsive rhythm. "Softly ingenious" is particularly jarring as an unmotivated modifier.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=2.1)
    Severe repetition of keyword artifacts degrades the prose quality; "cheerful gloom" (4x), "transliterate/d" (6x), and "conjecture" (5x) appear with distracting frequency in a short space. The writing relies almost exclusively on telling and abstract nouns rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.8)
    Competent sentence variation is undermined by purple prose ("whispering," "pricked," "symphony of controlled variables") and a lack of information density. The narrative relies on "telling" the audience's reaction ("wide-eyed wonder") rather than showing specific, grounded details.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from heavy repetition of specific phrases ("obsidian grace" x3, "fledge" x3, "nostalgia ban" x4) and clunky modifiers ("moonstone cabochon dust speck"). The reliance on "purple" descriptors and passive constructions stalls momentum and obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but leans into purple phrasing ("dawn bled light," "radiant storm of color") and alliteration. While mechanically competent, the use of phrases like "noctilucent reckonings" feels like forced prompt insertion rather than natural diction for the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=2.1)
    The prose is dense with abstract nominalizations, mixed metaphors ("transmute personal agony into a universal language"), and repetitive sentence structures. Several phrases are repeated mechanically ("slow dance of celestial bodies," "hard softness," "gently skilled"), creating a template cadence. The reliance on therapy-speak prevents any concrete imagery from taking hold.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is competent but flowery ("gentle sea caresses"), relying on adjective-heavy description; "template cadence" in the middle action beats (she did X, then Y happened) reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from abstract noun scaffolding ("histories," "truth," "resilience") and cliché phrasing ("glimpse of the past flooded her senses"). Adverb-adjective pairings like "sensitively perceptive" and "singular motivation" weaken the description.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is dense with "telling" constructions and purple adjective-noun pairings ("dusky harmony," "palpable stillness") that stall momentum. Prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly ("stood perceptively calm"), creating grammatical friction and highlighting the artificiality of the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers significantly from the repetitive, verbatim insertion of prompt phrases (e.g., "operatively gentle," "muster," and "anchor ideals" each appear nearly three times). This creates a "checklist" cadence that breaks immersion. The writing relies on clichés ("spiderweb glistening with dew," "golden shadows") and abstract telling over concrete showing.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is functional but suffers from adjective stacking ("delicate, fossilized shell," "deep, jagged fissures") and standard phrasing ("ethereal light," "profound silence") that dulls the imagery. While there are no mechanical errors, the reliance on abstraction prevents the line-level work from achieving the "fractured grace" it describes.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose relies heavily on a repetitive "adjective, adjective noun" cadence ("gentle, persistent flurries," "soft, insistent lullaby," "sharp, clear note"). Telling replaces showing in key moments ("Her motivation was simple yet profound," "moved with a bodily poetic grace"), and the density of abstract nouns dilutes the scene's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from severe "artifact" issues, with keywords ("meteor hush," "campfire story stick") repeated frequently enough to create a checklist effect. A grammatical error ("Her uncommonly serenity allowed her...") results from clumsily forcing a required phrase, and the reliance on abstract labels obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing of key terms ("interrupted cadence," "transiently rooted") within a short space creates artifact loops and signals prompt-stuffing. Clichés like "tears pricking his eyes" and "heart ached" weaken the emotional delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.1)
    The specific phrase "snowmelt ardor" appears three times and "technically gentle" twice in a short text, creating a conspicuous looping artifact that feels like checklist compliance. While the sentence structure is generally varied, these repetitions and some purple phrasing ("cradle of rediscovery") detract from line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.8)
    While there are moments of strong imagery, the prose is often cluttered with adjectives and forced prompt phrases ("precisely playful," "ethereal grit") that disrupt the flow. Repetitive noun phrases ("decaying directive," "wafer seal") and tell-y sentence structures reduce line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=2.6)
    The prose is severely marred by the verbatim repetition of awkward phrases ("empirically ironic," "dusky harmony," "schematic representations") three to four times each in a short space. Tautologies like "the irony was empirically ironic" destroy clarity and immersion. These repetitive artifacts stifle momentum and read as forced keyword insertions rather than organic craft.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés ("flowed like a river," "burning with unresolved anger") and awkward phrasings used to integrate prompt elements ("possessed the attribute of reappearing"). The reliance on abstract nouns and passive constructions drains momentum and texture from the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from telling over showing ("The tone was one of fragile beauty") and relies on clichéd imagery ("brittle bones," "diamond-like sparks"). Repetitive sentence structures and explicit labeling of atmosphere flatten the narrative impact.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from "keyword stuffing," mechanically repeating prompt terms ("feisty determination," "feisty spirit," "accidental revelation," "accidental wisdom") in a way that creates artificial rhythm and tells rather than shows. Information density is low due to the reliance on summary and scaffolding sentences ("Elara decided to persist").

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.3)
    Functional prose is weakened by telling ("This realization struck her with the force of a meteor") and adverbial shortcuts ("Suddenly," "oddly heavy"). The line-level craft relies on abstract descriptors rather than concrete action to convey internal states.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from "telling" and repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("carefully resourceful" appears twice as a descriptor; "unheard symphony" appears twice). Abstract metaphors ("complex harmony of urgency and silence") obscure rather than clarify the sensory experience, and the rhythm is flattened by expository sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant "thesaurus-itis" and cliché ("fog clung... like a shroud," "fractured heart"). Abstract nouns and adjective-heavy telling ("blissfully aberrant") replace concrete imagery, resulting in a sluggish rhythm and low information density. The text relies on "scaffold" sentences that explain significance rather than showing it through action.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing and text loops; "warmly methodical" and the "confusion into clarity" motif are repeated verbatim as bookends, feeling like forced checkpoints. Descriptions rely on abstract nouns ("energy," "logic," "chaos") rather than concrete sensory details. The rhythm is monotonous, mirroring the lack of narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition artifacts, specifically the phrase "gently luminous," which appears four times as a static epithet. The writing relies heavily on abstract noun-adjective pairings ("deafening storm," "ethereal clarity") that tell rather than show.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("thistle-blown hope," "shard of hush") that reads as forced insertion. The phrase "retrocognitively blessed" constitutes a significant register artifact that breaks the lyrical flow.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is cluttered with filter verbs ("He noted," "suspected," "realized," "conjectured") that create distance. Recurring scaffold sentences ("He descended," "He moved," "He recorded") and adjective stacking ("soft embrace," "unyielding plain") stifle momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from synonym churn and abstract noun phrases ("essence of the fortress's sorrow," "potential energy") that obscure concrete action. There is a reliance on clichés ("boots crunching softly," "vast, empty canvas") and filter verbs that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by filter verbs ("She saw," "She felt," "She sensed") and abstract nouns ("texture of time," "essence of transition"). The reliance on telling over showing creates a barrier to immersion, and the rhythm is repetitive, lacking the propulsive density required for high-band literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is polished with good rhythm, particularly in the lists of silences. However, the density of adjectives in the climax ("vast, intricate lattice," "palpable, warm stillness") slows the momentum, and the forced inclusion of prompt phrases occasionally results in clunky syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is heavily marred by template cadence, with a persistent "Subject-Verb" sentence structure (e.g., "Elara remembered," "Elara ceased," "Elara felt," "Elara smiled"). This repetitive scaffolding creates a monotonous rhythm that kills momentum and highlights the summary nature of the text.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=2.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("ruby flake" appears six times) and awkward prompt-forcing ("Through the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals..."). "Wisely adventurous" is a clumsy epithet that weakens descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is dense with mixed metaphors and abstract phrasing ("void so full of absence it had its own weight") that obscures rather than illuminates. Line-level artifacts include "purple prose," "filter verbs" (he sensed, he understood), and "synonym churn" regarding emptiness and shadows. The writing prioritizes sounding profound over clarity and momentum, resulting in significant drag.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is overwritten and repetitive, with specific phrases like "virtuously mischievous," "shadowseam wonder," and "quantum promise" appearing multiple times as jarring labels. Heavy adjective-noun pairing ("tactile reminder," "metallic certainty," "ethereal light") clogs the rhythm, and the reliance on abstract metaphor ("sound like a universe sighing") obscures the concrete action of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=2.3)
    Severe phrase looping triggers major penalties: "golden shadows" appears six times, "sepia reading room" four times, and "bridge of intuition" four times in a short text. The prose is cluttered with abstract nouns and clichés ("first yawn of evening," "threads of intuition"), lacking concrete imagery or syntactic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose suffers from severe artifacting, with specific phrases ("factually mystical," "shivering bliss," "murmured allegiance") repeated verbatim 3–4 times in a short space. This creates a robotic, template-like cadence that disqualifies the work from professional consideration.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from purple phrasing ("palimpsest of time," "hummed with the examined unknown") and adjective-heavy descriptions that slow momentum. Clichés such as "balm on her own heartbreak" and "aching wound" replace fresh, specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=1.5)
    The prose is severely marred by repetitive looping of prompt phrases ("carefully resourceful," "plans unraveled," "tyranny of indifference") which appear verbatim multiple times. This creates a mechanical, fill-in-the-blanks rhythm that destroys immersion. The writing relies heavily on abstract telling ("surge of coded freedom") rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=2.8)
    Significant deduction for repetitive scaffold loops: the phrase "As dewdrops formed" (or variations) is used five times as a mechanical transition, often starting paragraphs. Key phrases ("vested hush," "quietly vivid") are repeated to the point of semantic satiation, dulling the prose momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers severely from "artifact" repetition, with specific phrases (e.g., "regional folklore," "emerged transformed always," "mossy delight") appearing ~5 times each in a short text. This keyword stuffing destroys sentence-level variety and momentum. The "moonstone cabochon dust speck" is a clunky noun cluster that halts the flow every time it appears.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is functional but laden with adjectives and standard descriptions ("roaring curtain," "swirling leaves"). The phrase "uncertainly certain" reads as a forced oxymoron that disrupts the flow. There is a reliance on telling over showing, with summary sentences diluting the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, with vivid imagery like "scrubbed the soot" and "veins of gold." However, the text suffers from forced phrasing ("factually mystical," "kintsugi intentions") that creates clunky rhythmic bumps. There is a tendency toward abstract noun stacking ("profound gravity," "luminous regret") that creates a slightly purple texture.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases constitutes a major artifact failure; "luminous ache" appears five times and "modestly fearless" four times, creating a robotic loop. The prose is laden with adjective-noun clusters that clutter the rhythm without adding density.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is functional but marred by clichés ("creeping tide") and heavy abstractions ("coordinates of suffering," "visceral memory"). The writing often tells the reader what to feel through metaphor stacks ("shores of a painful wakefulness") rather than grounding the experience in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of complex phrases ("elusively tangible," "eternal instant," "between childhood and now," "anchors of intuition") each appearing three or more times creates a mechanical, looping rhythm. These artifacts clutter the prose and break immersion, reading like a checklist rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("Leo saw," "Leo felt," "Leo realized") and explanatory telling ("The dust told a story of neglect"). Clichéd phrasing ("silence had grown thick," "sickly glow") and abstract metaphors dampen the textural impact and immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from abstract noun usage and adverbial clutter ("serenely," "chaotic energy," "destabilizing attribute"), which distances the reader. The reliance on telling ("This pattern revealed a sequence") rather than showing the process drains momentum and tactile engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.4)
    The text suffers from repetitive phrasing ("burnished sorrow," "poetically inclined mind" both appear twice) and scaffolding sentences ("Her motivation was clear"). Abstract descriptors ("sorrowful beauty") replace concrete imagery, and summary is used in place of active scene building.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=2.9)
    Basic grammatical errors undermine the prose significantly ("a event," "a ancient," "a entity"). The repetition of prompt phrases ("tinkersong wonder" appears three times; "mending what isn't torn" four times) creates a mechanical, scaffolded rhythm. The density of adjectives slows the momentum without adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetitive artifacts (three uses each of "resonant hush" and "hinged awakenings" in a short space) indicate a lack of polish. A blatant typo ("a offering") further degrades the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is functional but dense with adjectives and abstract nouns ("swirling, depthless nebula," "timewoven alliances"). While grammatically sound, the reliance on "telling" summaries and heavy modifiers creates a sluggish rhythm that distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant repetition of prompt phrases ("umbral tenderness" x3, "reckoned" x3, "dawning hush" x3) creates a mechanical, fill-in-the-blank rhythm. These text artifacts and the timeline confusion (autumn to spring to autumn) undermine line-level coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns and clichés ("weight of history," "resonance of long-held secrets," "searing reverie") instead of concrete imagery. Crucial realizations are summarized ("The truth was complex, fraught with moral dilemmas") rather than shown through specific details.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.6)
    Heavy scaffolding artifacts mar the prose, specifically the awkward, repetitive insertion of the phrase "through working memory" (four times) and "rejected the false comfort" (three times). The text relies on abstract nominalizations ("chemistry of transformation") instead of concrete verbs and images.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.4)
    Syntactic monotony is a significant issue; nearly every paragraph is driven by "He [verb]" or "The [noun] [verb]" constructions, creating a drumbeat rhythm. The prose relies on clichés ("shivers down his spine," "opened his eyes") and adjectival padding ("delicate and precise," "pale petals").

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is grammatically functional but marred by the clumsy, repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("wild serenity," "furious tranquility") that act as semantic loops. The mixture of diction—scientific terms like "entropy" alongside "incantations"—creates a jarring textural artifact that disrupts the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=3.3)
    Sentence structure is repetitive, relying heavily on "She [verb]" and "Her [noun]" openers that create a drone-like cadence. Required phrases like "after the glue dried" and "credibly curious" are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the flow and acting as visible text artifacts rather than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is marred by heavy repetition of prompt phrases ("primal elegance," "yellow lantern glass," "shooting star tracking station") which appear as inserted keywords rather than organic description. Sentence structure is repetitive and list-like ("He watched...", "He held...", "He swept..."). The density of abstract nouns creates a "purple" effect that lacks friction.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is marred by clumsy integration of required phrases, resulting in telling rather than showing ("Through contextual clues" used as a transition, "His motivation was clear"). The writing suffers from passive construction and abstract nouns, and the "timeframe" sentence reads like a register error, sounding more like technical analysis than narrative fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is functional but saturated with clichés ("flower opening to the sun," "fabric of moments," "time... as a river"). The relentless use of weaving/tapestry metaphors becomes repetitive, and abstract nouns replace concrete imagery in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.6)
    Prose is dense with filter verbs ("He felt," "He remembered") and abstract modifiers; the repetition of prompt phrases like "burnished hush" and "woven dawns" creates significant artifact drag. The text tells rather than shows, explaining the poet's "warmly attentive" nature instead of demonstrating it.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies on repetitive lexical artifacts, specifically the phrase "brazen calm," which appears three times (opening, middle, end) and feels like a forced scaffold rather than a natural motif. "Gently systematic" is also repeated. The reliance on filter phrases ("Elara observed," "She felt a surge") distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is competent but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("bronze quiet" appears twice; "dusty footprints" repeats). There is a logical clash in imagery—footprints are "dusty" on a path described as "rainwashed" and "gleaming from recent showers." The writing relies heavily on summary and abstract descriptors ("glow of doubt") rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is marred by the mechanical, repeated insertion of prompt phrases ("narrow vastness," "submerged concord," "after the reef dies") which disrupts the rhythm. The text relies on "telling" summaries and adjective-heavy descriptions ("tiny promise," "brittle and brown") rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.6)
    Line-level craft is marred by clichés ("silence that felt like a held breath") and forced phrasing to accommodate prompt elements ("intuitively descriptive nature"). These artifacts disrupt the flow and lend the prose a manufactured feel.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive phrasing ("echoed silence" appears three times; "temporally stretched" appears three times; "gilded compass rose" appears three times) within a short span. The sentence structure is often passive or expository ("His motivation... was to..."), lacking rhythmic variety and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by modifier density ("needle of ancient ice," "sickly green halo") that slows momentum. There is a reliance on stock phrasing ("heart full of purpose," "shrouded in mist") that dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose is weighed down by "purple" abstraction ("nomadic penumbra," "shackles of forgetfulness") and a pervasive reliance on filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized," "seemed to"). Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a passive cadence that reduces narrative momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("mist in her mind," "bloomed like flowers," "threads in the tapestry"). Abstract nouns dilute the imagery, and the rhythm is repetitive and list-like.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases ("woven hush," "winnow," "productive fidgeting," "fierce repose" each appear 3–4 times) creates a mechanical, checklist-like rhythm. These text loops distract significantly from the prose flow and readability.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is polished but suffers from significant lexical repetition; words like "truth" (10+ uses), "refract" (7 uses), and "shards" clutter the text. The reliance on abstract nouns over concrete verbs slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose flow is disrupted by clunky prompt insertions ("dire enchantment" used twice as a label) and mixed metaphors ("quilt of collective consciousness"). The reliance on abstract adjectives reduces the immediacy of the physical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is dense with abstract telling ("movements slow with nostalgia," "painful yet liberating") and clichés ("broken peace," "gentle hum"). The reliance on adjectives to convey emotion robs the scene of immediacy, and the sentence structures often repetitively frame the protagonist's thoughts as absolute truths.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is frequently overwrought, relying on clichés ("shattered like glass") and forced oxymorons ("screaming tenderness," "silent sound") that obscure rather than clarify. Abstract concepts like "vibrations of intent" are described with high density but low concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from a reliance on abstract nouns and "therapy-speak" concepts ("raw solace," "necessary comfort") instead of concrete imagery. Sentence rhythm is repetitive, often utilizing a "telling" structure that summarizes emotional shifts rather than dramatizing them.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose relies heavily on expositional scaffolding ("Elara, a rational truffle forager...", "Elara's motivation was simple..."). Several metaphors are stock clichés ("fortress of logic," "words that felt like ash"), and filtering verbs ("She felt," "She saw") distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from passive constructions ("The method he employed was by observing gaps") and clunky, meta-fictional phrasing ("The core concept of these borrowed memories haunted him"). Information density is low due to the summary style. There are logical disconnects in the imagery (e.g., "mist... soft, gray orb" describing the world). Filter verbs clutter the text, reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    Repetitive sensory tags ("glimmer," "shimmer") and the clumsy recurring phrase "empirically intuitive" clutter the prose. The writing is functional but lacks the fresh, specific density required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=3.6)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("weight of her crown," "cage," "liquid mercury"). The forced insertion of "lacy menace" creates a semantic category error that disrupts the tone. Sentence structures are repetitive, creating a monotonous rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is cluttered with abstract nouns ("essence," "potential," "meaning," "presence") that obscure concrete action. "Directed spontaneity" and other prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the rhythm. There is a reliance on telling ("words landed with the force of a revelation") instead of showing the impact through sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is burdened by a high density of similes ("like a rag doll," "like broken teeth," "like a stubborn stain") and clichés ("silence so profound," "physical weight"). These artifacts and the reliance on abstract noun constructions dilute the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is overwritten with "purple" abstractions and mixed metaphors ("clung to the city like a silent prayer," "muffling the world in a trembling calm"). Abstract nouns (grace, hope, resilience) replace concrete imagery. The writing tells the reader how to feel rather than evoking the sensation through specific detail.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=3.0)
    Significant issues with repetitive phrasing (loops of "shed," "stories," and "saturated hush") and "tell-y" sentence structures ("Her motivation was..."). A major logical break occurs when the protagonist speaks aloud "during this held breath," physically contradicting the action. Abstract nouns replace concrete imagery throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is competent and clear, with some strong sensory details ("scent of aged paper"). However, it relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("profound hush," "mournful sonata," "tangible memory") that soften the impact of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=2.2)
    Severe repetition of key phrases ("resounding hush" appears ~7 times; "universe's hiccup" ~6 times) creates a distracting, template-like cadence. The prose relies on clichés ("echoed like a thunderclap," "mist under a rising sun") and abstract labels rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=3.0)
    The text suffers from severe artifacting and looping, with key phrases ("After blowing the whistle," "eminently peculiar," "razor edges," "counting backwards") repeated 3–5 times each in a short space, creating a checklist-like cadence. This repetition, combined with heavy filter verbs ("He saw," "He realized," "He felt") and abstract noun phrases, stifles narrative momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.1)
    Significant repetitive artifacting disrupts the prose; the phrase "quiet wildfire" appears three times, "familiar stranger" four times, and "physics of letting go" three times in a short space. These repetitions, along with abstract noun phrases, create a scaffolded, rhythmic monotony that dulls the narrative impact.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases (e.g., "clover melancholy" and "lucid contradictions" appear four times each), which creates a template cadence and disrupts flow. Additionally, the reliance on telling over showing ("symbol of fragile illumination") reduces the information density and vividness of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose leans heavily on abstract summary to convey the climax, describing the result of the magic ("clarified her thoughts," "making the pain less sharp") instead of showing the sensory process. While grammatically clean, the reliance on explanation over dramatization saps the scene of momentum and visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is marred by severe repetition of prompt phrases ("haunted euphoria," "gently thorough," "context had changed") which appear multiple times as static labels. The writing relies almost exclusively on telling/summary ("Her work was gently thorough") rather than showing concrete action, creating a mechanical, checklist-like rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies on repetitive abstract labels ("desperately jocular" appears three times; "reciprocity" three times; "polite anarchy" twice) which acts as a scaffold rather than organic description. Key emotional beats are told via abstraction ("catalysis of emotion he could not name") rather than shown. The density of "tell" over "show" slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose rhythm is generally smooth, but register slips like "downloaded into her soul" clash with the "ancient, wordless" tone. The text relies heavily on abstract adjective-noun pairings ("profound stillness," "quiet blaze") that reduce information density and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.5)
    Abstract phrasing ("chaff of her failure," "cascade of relational truth") creates a barrier to immersion. The prose relies on tell-heavy metaphors and repetitive descriptors ("unbend... straighten," "dried-up pen... exotic nib") that stall momentum and distance the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition, with the phrase "joyful sorrow" appearing three times, functioning as a text loop. Clichéd imagery ("liquid silver," "symphony woven within") and abstract nouns dilute impact. The reliance on label-adjective pairings ("graceful farewell," "profound connection") reduces information density.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is marred by the clumsy, repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("volcanic tenderness" appears three times) and "telling" constructions ("His motivation was to..."). The reliance on adjectives over verbs slows momentum and weakens specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is heavily reliant on static "to be" verbs ("Elara was," "Her method was," "The dream was") and repetitive sentence structures that stifle momentum. Abstract nouns ("infinite possibilities," "ethereal gold") replace concrete imagery, resulting in "purple" description that tells rather than shows. There is a lack of lexical specificity, relying instead on generic sci-fi/fantasy gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose relies on standard adjective-noun pairings ("uncanny ability," "hurried shuffle," "confident stride") and oxymorons ("calculated spontaneity") that read as prompt-patching. The writing is competent but lacks freshness, relying on clichés ("alive with," "cutting through the... darkness").

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is dense with abstract nouns and forced adjectival phrases ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension") that clutter the imagery. The story relies on telling over showing ("Her motivation was clear," "This was her lesson"), and the repetition of prompt-specific phrasing disrupts the rhythm. Line-level momentum is stalled by the need to explain the significance of actions rather than letting them land.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is overwritten and reliant on cliché adjective-noun pairings ("visual symphony," "tapestry of unease," "protective shroud"). Metaphors are frequent but often mixed or ornamental, reducing narrative density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose relies on abstract descriptors ("innate grace," "fluid contrast," "melancholic song") and tells the reader what to feel rather than evoking it. The phrase "combative tenderness" is inserted as a definition rather than arising from the character's voice or situation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is burdened by purple abstractions ("skeleton of color," "echo in the void") and frequent filter verbs that summarize experience instead of dramatizing it. The reliance on explaining the significance of actions ("This was her method...") halts momentum and reduces immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose relies heavily on "telling" over "showing" ("His motivation was pure," "As an aesthetically driven soul"). Sentence structures are repetitive and declarative, lacking rhythmic variety. The text includes explanatory scaffolding ("symbolizing the end of an era") that dilutes the immediacy of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose is weakened by abstract telling and hollow modifiers ("fascinating ways," "effortless precision," "serene composure") instead of concrete imagery. The reliance on summary for pivotal moments (the painting process) robs the story of immediacy, and the sentence structure often lacks rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition artifacts driven by the prompt. "Golden shadows" appears six times, "propel/propelled" four times, and "powerfully gentle" three times in a short text. These repetitions act as scaffolding, creating a template-like quality that obscures the narrative flow and reduces lexical variety.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is marred by the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("subdued ardor," "genuinely artificial," "curtains of intention") which appear multiple times as clumsy labels. This creates a scaffolded, checklist feel that disrupts the rhythm. The repetition of "genuinely artificial" specifically reads as a forced oxymoron rather than an organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=2.9)
    Significant "text artifact" failure: specific phrases ("After the cryptocurrency crashes," "multiplying paths," "steadily curious") repeat in a fixed structural loop across paragraphs. This scaffolded repetition destroys prose rhythm and immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of key phrases ("anguished joy" x3, "innocence" x4) which read as checklist insertions rather than organic description. The reliance on abstract telling ("steadily unpredictable," "transcendent joy") reduces line-level impact and density.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant prose artifacts mar the execution. The phrase "softly deliberate" is repeated verbatim (paras 1 and 3), and "luminous" appears three times (screen, act, regret), creating a distracting echo. Additionally, "force a metamorphose" (para 4) is a grammatical error (using the verb as a noun) that disrupts flow.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished but suffers from density issues, relying on adjective-heavy phrasing ("silent, silver shroud," "palpable quiet") and standard similes ("fragile as a bird's egg"). While mechanically clean, the writing draws attention to its own poetic ambition rather than the action itself.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from lexical repetition ("meteor hush" and "displaced miracle" both appear multiple times in a short space) and cliché ("shattering glass"). The density of abstract metaphors ("story of impact") occasionally obscures the concrete action of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition artifacts mar the prose; "hushed thunder" appears four times, and "spatially imaginative" and "incubate" are looped as labels rather than integrated actions. This repetitiveness creates a drag on momentum and highlights the artificiality of the prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive looping, with phrases like "remembered stardust," "unwritten calendar," and "shadowed rapture" repeated 3-4 times each in a short space. The writing is adjective-heavy and relies on abstract nouns, lacking the muscular verb-noun density required for high-quality fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns and prompt-phrase repetition ("glowing dune," "wave functions") rather than concrete, specific action. Phrasing like "pulsed like slow heartbeats" and "needle through cloth" leans on cliché, and the density of adjectives ("fractured," "discordant," "divergent") slows momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose relies heavily on "telling" scaffolds ("Her motivation was clear," "This was her confirmation") that sap momentum. Phrases like "forever changed" and "unlocked deeper understanding" read as clichés that flatten the closure image. There is a lack of sentence-level propulsion, with the narrative prioritizing summary over dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("patience of ages," "velvet blue," "sentinels") and filter verbs ("felt," "realized") that distance the reader. The phrase "shoreline lullaby" is repeated three times as a static tag rather than a developing motif, creating a repetitive loop without accumulating weight.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose relies heavily on "to be" verbs and static descriptions ("was a tangible force," "was a choice"), which stalls momentum. Several phrases appear to be inserted to satisfy prompt requirements ("seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope") without being rhythmically or tonally integrated into the sentences. The reliance on telling over showing weakens the impact of pivotal moments, particularly the realization in the archives.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is purple and overwrought ("strata of dust," "cycles measured across the pause"), prioritizing ornamental phrasing over clarity and momentum. Melodramatic lines ("stain the pages with truth") distract from the narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by summary artifacts ("The delayed revelation was that...") and the forced, repetitive use of specific phrases that disrupt flow. Line-level tension is low, as the writing tends to explain the significance of events rather than showing them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is heavily laden with oxymorons and purple phrasing (&quot;thunderous serenity,&quot; &quot;silence that was anything but empty&quot;) that reduce clarity. Relying on filter verbs (&quot;She knew,&quot; &quot;She felt&quot;) and abstract summaries creates distance and drags momentum during what should be the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is weighed down by adjective stacking ("intricate, cryptic," "steamy, mineral-scented") and abstract nouns ("significance," "potential"). The reliance on summary transitions ("words slowly revealing," "began drafting") drains momentum from pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is dense with abstract nouns and repetitive labeling ("pearl of stillness" and "somatic" both appear three times in a short text). There is a pervasive reliance on telling over showing ("She was quietly talented," "quiet triumph"), and the sentence structure often loops into explanatory clauses that kill momentum. The phrasing "The action of freeze often followed" is particularly awkward and mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is dense with abstract nouns and filter verbs ("He saw that he had not failed," "He feared that abyss"), heavily favoring telling over showing. While technically functional, the reliance on internal summary and metaphorical strings ("threads," "knots," "kaleidoscope") stalls narrative momentum and obscures the physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is dense with modifiers, creating a repetitive rhythm of adjective-noun constructions ("relentless gales," "volatile fluid," "dreamlike lethargy"). Telling often replaces showing, particularly with internal states. Filter verbs clutter the pivotal moments of realization, dulling their impact.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose suffers from awkward "text artifacts" where prompt phrases are inserted verbatim ("bravely conflicted," "blink that follows surprise") disrupting natural flow. Sentence structure is repetitive and relies on clichés ("shiver of anticipation," "heart pounding"), creating a mechanical rhythm that lacks literary density.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is marred by heavy repetition of prompt words ("inculcate," "chaos," "tranquil blaze") and abstract telling ("senselessly perceptive nature"). Sentence structures are repetitive, and keywords are shoehorned in awkwardly, disrupting the natural flow.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is heavily marred by the repetitive use of required keywords ("zigzag" appears four times; "rail spike" six times) within a short word count, creating a distracting echo. This keyword stuffing flattens the momentum and highlights the artificiality of the construction. Sentence structures are often repetitive ("Kael [verb]..."), reducing the line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.0)
    The phrase "solemn playfulness" creates a repetitive artifact, appearing twice effectively verbatim. The logic of the "proof by contradiction" metaphor is muddled; finding the evidence technically means the proof *succeeded* in disproving the assumption of innocence, yet the text claims the proof "was failing."

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and mixed metaphors ("hummed with a meteor hush," "phantom frequencies," "tapestry of redemption"). Abstract nouns frequently replace concrete verbs, and the density of adjectives slows momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is weighed down by adjective stacking ("messy, confusing silence," "deliberate, graceful sweeps") and abstract phrasing ("deep, pervasive unease"). The reliance on summarizing emotional states ("faces easing from tension to wonder") drains immediacy and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is burdened by heavy abstraction ("map of states of being," "retrocognitive surge") and "therapy-speak" labels ("trauma," "empathy," "states of being"). Phrases like "warm coldness" and "retrocognitively trapped" are clunky and disrupt the rhythm, prioritizing complex descriptors over concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is weighed down by excessive modification and cliché metaphors ("tapestry of renewal," "shattered glass," "weeping violets"). There is a reliance on "telling" via abstract nouns ("possibility," "eternity," "despair") instead of grounding emotion in concrete action. The phrase "Elara was synesthetically blessed" is a clumsy expository tell that disrupts the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("fractally precise" used twice, "somatic markers" three times) and abstract summary that distances the reader. "Willowglass hope" feels like a forced insertion that clashes with the surrounding diction. The reliance on telling ("The evidence was in the growing tapestry") flattens the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose relies on abstract telling ("vivid, tangible charts," "ancient magic") and clunky phrasing ("factually mystical event") rather than concrete imagery. Filter verb stacks and standard adjective-noun pairings ("elegant, silent grace") stifle the line-level energy.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose leans toward purple abstraction ("sourceless light," "tangled knot of inevitability") rather than concrete action. A significant tense error occurs with the forced insertion of a prompt phrase ("As the truth unravels, she began"), disrupting the timeline's grammatical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose suffers from heavy "purple" description and a reliance on telling over showing ("promised renewal but delivered only memory"). Cliché similes and abstract nouns crowd the sentences, reducing information density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=2.4)
    The text suffers from severe repetitive artifacts, reusing complex phrases like "spindrift serenity," "percolate," and "ambient awareness" multiple times in identical constructions. These "Mad Libs" insertions destroy rhythm and create a mechanical, low-density texture.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("He sensed," "He saw," "He realized") which distance the reader. "Sharp gentleness" is an oxymoron used twice that confuses rather than illuminates. The writing tells the reader what to feel ("fragile peace," "profound connection") rather than evoking it through imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.1)
    Severe repetitive artifacts harm the prose; prompt phrases like "quivering hush" (3x), "instill/ing" (5x), and "wistfully pragmatic" (2x) are pasted in verbatim. This mechanical repetition, combined with the "She [verb]" sentence stem loops, creates a significant drag on readability.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is marred by severe repetitive loops, specifically the phrase "brittle awakening" (used four times) and "atomically reflective" (used three times), which read as unintegrated prompt artifacts. The reliance on filter verbs ("she saw," "she realized," "she understood") dulls the immediacy of the scene. The phrasing is often abstract and repetitive, lacking rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract noun constructions ("universe of intention," "sanctified by the shared experience") that distance the reader from concrete reality. "Prismatic quiet" reads as a forced poeticism rather than a precise image. The writing is mechanically fluid but suffers from a lack of density and specific, grounded action.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant "telling" artifacts, most notably the direct insertion of the prompt phrase ("The tone of the night was one of ethereal grit") as a descriptor. Over-reliance on modifier-noun pairings ("fervent factions," "grim determination," "calculated anger") slows momentum and distances the reader from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=2.6)
    Severe keyword stuffing creates a mechanical rhythm; full phrases like "blueprint drafting compass point" and "spatial mutiny" are repeated endlessly (4-7 times each) without variation. This results in heavy "template cadence" and scaffold artifacts that obstruct immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but overwritten in places ("lance the swelling secret," "fibers of her coat"), leaning on abstract metaphors to carry plot weight. While there are no glaring technical errors, the reliance on "telling" the emotional significance of the ribbon rather than "showing" it through sensory detail weakens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=2.0)
    The prose is marred by egregious repetition, with specific phrases ("nervously confident," "spongey dread") each appearing three times in a short text. The writing relies almost exclusively on telling rather than showing, draining the piece of immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of key phrases ("dynamically observant," "scaffold wrap flutters," "luminous disbelief") creates a scaffolded, fill-in-the-blanks rhythm. The prose is dense with abstract modifiers ("radiant awe," "cosmic truth," "stark beauty") and paraphrase loops where the same idea is restated in adjacent clauses.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is weighed down by the clumsy insertion of prompt phrases ("perceptively calm demeanor," "dusky harmony"), resulting in abstract, adjectival writing. The reliance on telling over showing flattens the rhythm and distances the reader from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose leans heavily on filter verbs ("She felt," "She saw") and clichés ("flowing... like a balm"), explaining emotions instead of evoking them through concrete action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density that often obscures clarity ("unbend the rigid silence," "swirling orchard vortex churned"). Key prompt phrases like "warlike serenity" are inserted awkwardly as descriptors rather than established atmospherically. The repetition of "unbend" feels mechanical and forced to meet a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of multi-word phrases ("anxious elation," "purposefully curious," "maze topiary clipping," "eclipsed covenant") within a very short word count. This creates a "checklist" cadence that deadens momentum. The reliance on adjective-heavy description ("tiny, intricate piece," "shimmering portal") obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=3.5)
    Line-level craft is heavily penalized by the "paste-bomb" repetition of prompt phrases ("fiercely gentle" and "dusky resolve" both appear three times), which creates a distracting loop artifact. The prose tends toward the purple ("cocoon of introspection," "whispering boots") and abstract, prioritizing adjective density over concrete action and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from weak transitions ("Suddenly," "Then") and heavy reliance on "telling" ("tangible echo," "hollow quiet"). Phrases like "echo valley longing" feel mechanically inserted rather than organic to the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.9)
    The text suffers significantly from the repetition of prompt phrases as inserted artifacts; "kindly methodical," "haunted ambitions," "touching distance," and "analogical thinking" each appear multiple times verbatim. This repetition creates a checklist feel and disrupts the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is polished but relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("ethereal," "abiding wonder," "serenity") and static "telling" constructions. There is a lack of sentence-level propulsion, and the rhythm becomes monotonous due to the repetitive structure of the tasks described.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is weighed down by filter verbs ("He felt," "He saw," "He realized") that create narrative distance and dull immediacy. Reliance on abstract nouns (hope, sorrow, essence) and clichés ("tears welled," "walls around his heart") prevents the imagery from becoming concrete or visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density and sentimental abstraction ("raw solace," "tapestry of faded ink"). Several "tell" sentences summarize emotional states that should be dramatized, and the "daringly methodical" phrasing feels like an awkward insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe artifact penalties apply for the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("cautious exuberance" x4, "propagation delays" x4, "cyclically reversed" x5) within a short text. This mechanical looping destroys rhythm and immersion, reading like a checklist rather than a story. Abstract nouns replace concrete imagery throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose has good rhythm and density, but tends toward "purple" descriptors ("bruise-purple," "shimmering air," "unseen wind"). The insertion of required phrases occasionally disrupts the natural flow.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of specific phrases ("lucidly watchful," "radiant hush," "threshold of stillness" each appear three times), creating a mechanical, looping cadence. Adjective density is high ("delicate blend," "latent energy," "soft, green luminescence"), resulting in purple prose that dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers severely from looped artifacts and scaffold phrases repeated verbatim ("forgiving the unforgivable," "vineyard hush," "kindly decisive," "think better"). This repetition creates a mechanical, robotic cadence that disrupts immersion. The reliance on abstract nouns and telling over showing creates a low-density text.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract telling ("unshakable conviction," "inner detachment") and explanatory metaphors that distance the reader from the scene. This abstraction prevents the "cloak" and "mirror" from feeling like tangible realities.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but relies on familiar metaphors ("seeds awaiting rain," "sand under tide") that lack freshness. The repeated phrase "sycamore hush" attempts to frame the tone but feels slightly ornamental and repetitive in a short space.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose suffers severely from verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("pulse left wandering" appears six times; "layered dust" three times; "historically reverent" three times). This creates a mechanical, checklist-like rhythm that disrupts immersion. The density is low, relying on abstract nouns rather than concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from abstract descriptors and filter verbs that distance the reader from the action. Key moments are summarized rather than shown, and the repetition of abstract phrases ("lingering luminance," "brilliant dimness") becomes tautological rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is functional but laden with clichés and scaffold sentences ("He moved," "He believed"). Prompt phrases like "wandered purposefully" are inserted awkwardly, creating oxymorons that contradict the purposeful, linear nature of the character's quest.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of key phrases ("wavelength align," "quiet enthusiasm," "stellar doubt," "static bursts") which appear as inserted keywords rather than organic language. The diction leans heavily on abstract nouns and "tell" constructions ("She believed," "She wondered"). This repetitive, summary-style phrasing stalls narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose suffers from abstract phrasing ("wove her essence," "crystallize the echo") and a density of filter verbs that tell the reader the character's reactions rather than showing them. "Bruised purple" and "ghost on the air" are clichéd descriptors that reduce freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from high repetition of key descriptors ("lukewarm" x3, "naive/naivety" x4) and abstract phrasing within a short word count. A basic grammatical error ("a event") and reliance on filter verbs weaken the line-level momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from heavy abstraction ("shared meaning," "deep respect," "profound satisfaction") and telling instead of showing. Key phrases from the prompt feel inserted rather than organic ("precisely humane," "mirrored hush"), and the rhythm is repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("ancient freshness" and "kaleidoscopic waterfall" both appear twice in a short text) and purple description. Clichés like "lead into gold" and "hard-won wisdom" flatten the impact. The density of adjectives slows momentum without adding specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant repetition of multi-word prompt phrases ("soundless echo," "remembering through muscle memory," "watcher's burden") creates a scaffolded, mechanical rhythm. "Attentively inventive" is a clunky modifier stack that tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from abstract telling and list-like descriptions of emotion ("grief, joy, fear, and hope") instead of concrete imagery. "Psychic reverberations" and similar phrases add clutter without clarifying the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("sparked a curiosity," "worked tirelessly," "kindred spirit") and abstract "telling" rather than sensory "showing." Adjective stacking and awkward phrasing ("mystery seed mail") reduce clarity and impact, while the summary mode in the final paragraph kills momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prompt word "macerate" is repeated three times, creating a noticeable lexical loop that feels forced rather than organic. The prose relies on melodramatic clichés ("extinguished like a star in a dead sky") and heavy modification that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=2.6)
    Severe repetitive artifacts (e.g., "Through the veil of sleep" x5, "dimensionally homesick" x4) and clumsy jargon ("interiorized the exteriors") suffocate the prose. These loops serve as padding rather than rhetorical emphasis, halting momentum and obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose suffers from heavy adjective stacking ("stoically sensitive," "resolved determination") and relies on clichés ("flash of insight," "heart-stopping moment"). Key prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly as labels ("encapsulating the tone of frozen bloom") rather than woven into the fabric of the sentence. The rhythm is repetitive, often following a "He [verb]... [explanation]" structure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.9)
    Significant repetition artifacts ("serenely electric" x4, "hollywood star fragment" x3, "shard of hush" x3) create a stuttering, checklist-like cadence. High adjective density slows momentum without adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is weighed down by adjective-heavy telling ("cold, piercing starlight," "resiliently positive") and abstract nouns. There is a lack of sensory density and concrete verbs, making the action feel floaty. Phrasing like "practiced hope" feels over-written and imprecise.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe repetition of key phrases ("unsettling calm" x4, "texture of connection" x4, "realistically imaginary" x3) creates a distracting scaffold that dominates the short word count.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is functional but marred by awkward prompt insertions ("balancedly curious" is a jarring adverb-adjective pair) and repetitive emotion labels ("somber marvel" appears twice). Abstract phrases like "shattered old paradigms" and "cosmic realities" reduce density and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is weighed down by abstract nouns ("existence," "oblivion," "destiny") and telling via adverbs ("persistently curious"). There is a reliance on stock phrasing ("ethereal light," "shifting shadows") and summary, avoiding the concrete density required for high-band literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is functional but heavily reliant on clichés ("breath hitched," "heart pounded," "clawed at her," "eternal dance"). The narrative tells rather than shows, summarizing emotional shifts instead of rendering them.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.8)
    Phrasing often relies on abstract nouns ("luminescence," "solace") rather than concrete particulars, and a typo ("a artifact") mars the polish. The clash between digital metaphors ("defragment") and physical ones (ink divination) creates a confused aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose has momentum, it suffers from a high density of stock metaphors and clichés ("silent witness," "sky the color of dried blood," "frozen lightning bolt," "desperation clawed"). These artifacts flatten the imagery in a story that demands high textural novelty. The mechanical proficiency is high, but the creative diction lacks freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from significant usage errors, notably using the verb "metamorphose" as a noun ("the metamorphose began," "memory of metamorphose"). The text is dense with abstract modifiers and "purple" descriptions that obscure clarity. Rhythm is monotonous, and the reliance on "telling" summaries drains momentum from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=2.5)
    Prose is marred by the forced, repetitive insertion of prompt words ("resonantly soft" x4, "uproot" x5), creating severe text artifacts that disrupt flow. The writing relies heavily on telling ("It was a relic of transformation") and clunky sentence structures to accommodate the required terms.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose suffers from repetitive vocabulary ("foster," "broken promises," "absences") and purple abstractions ("threads of connection," "torn social fabric"). The reliance on telling—explaining the significance of the bottle and the mail rather than showing it—stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("hours bled away," "dust motes dancing," "doors yawning") and repetitive use of prompt phrases ("misting hush" x3, "whispering gleam" x3). These artifacts flatten the texture and reduce the narrative's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose relies on abstract metaphors ("equations danced") and expositional scaffolding ("Her attribute was...") that violates the "show, don't tell" standard. The density of abstract nouns creates a "purple" texture without precise sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose suffers from high densities of abstract phrasing ("hush of improbable beginnings," "dreams bled into reality") that distance the reader from the physical action. Sentence structures are somewhat repetitive, and the word "vitalize" feels mechanically inserted rather than organic to the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is laden with purple abstractions ("enveloped secrets," "celestial silence") and lacks concrete imagery. Phrase repetition is a significant issue, particularly the triple use of "improbable longing" and double use of "unassumingly bold," which reads as forced prompt adherence rather than organic description. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings weakens the verb strength and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.0)
    Significant reliance on scaffold sentences hinders momentum (e.g., "Her motivation... was to," "Her method... was by," "She needed to detect"). These constructions create a distance that prevents immersion. Adjective density is high, often slowing the rhythm without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("steps a soft shuffle"), with strong imagery in the shards. However, the reliance on clichés ("steel and silk," "every ending can be a beginning") and the prompt-inserted oxymoron ("combative tenderness") detract from the freshness of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is weighed down by abstractions ("hush of budding hope that draped the dawn") and a high density of filter verbs ("She felt," "She knew"). Sentence structures are repetitive and formulaic, creating a monotonous rhythm that drags the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant artifacting lowers the score; the phrase "lucid unrest" appears three times and "silence" six times, creating a repetitive lexical loop. The insertion of "Across sharing a secret" as a dialogue tag is grammatically incoherent and breaks immersion. Adjective-noun pairings are often standard and lack freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe penalty for text artifacts/loops: the phrase "rain-scoured fresco vault" appears five times, "methodically curious" four times, and "shielded openness" three times. This repetitive scaffolding destroys narrative rhythm and creates a distinct "template" feel that obstructs immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is functional but marred by "miraculous" shortcuts to explain away impossibilities and mixed metaphors like flakes serving as a "map." The repetition of the prompt phrase "sophisticated melancholy" as a label within the text flattens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant "text artifact" penalties apply due to the forced, repetitive insertion of specific phrases ("driftingly alert" appears five times; "tinkersong wonder" appears three times) which creates a mechanical, looping rhythm. The prose relies on abstract nouns and telling ("unspoken needs were finally being acknowledged") rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from cliché ("heart pattering," "quiet drumbeat," "glowing softly") and adjective-heavy constructions that slow momentum. Phrasing is occasionally awkward, such as "the action of the narrative began to unfold," which reads as meta-commentary. The line-level craft lacks the density and freshness required for high-band consideration.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe repetitive artifacts degrade the prose quality; the phrase "quietly explosive" is used four times as a modifier, and "dusty starlight," "brass telescope," and "spooled wholeness" are looped repeatedly. This redundancy violates the template-cadence check and creates a rhythmic drone that obscures any line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from logical overreach, such as the protagonist "feeling" microscopic fractal patterns, which strains physical credibility. There is a tendency toward "telling" emotions through adjective-heavy phrasing ("profound hush," "heightened stillness").

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition artifacts degrade the prose; "stranded luminance" appears five times and "sociable isolation" four times in a very short text, creating a hollow echo chamber. Causality is weak at the line level, exemplified by the phrasebook magically falling open to the exact necessary page.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose relies on telling over showing and contains metaphorical clashes ("driftwood nostalgia" in a frozen library violates the setting's physical logic). Repetitive phrasing ("hauntingly bright" used as both descriptor and event) and abstract adjective strings dilute the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose is functional but laden with heavy adjective-noun pairings ("pervasive despair," "gentle, healing radiance") and overwrought metaphors ("brambled thing"). The reliance on abstract labels ("collective effort," "profound peace") weakens the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from the repetitive insertion of required phrases ("pane of hush," "nested patterns," "beautifully flawed," "bruised awe," "vouchsafe") which appear multiple times as clumsy artifacts. This creates a checklist effect that disrupts narrative flow and reduces lexical variety.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing, specifically the triple use of "graceless beauty" and double use of "offhandedly exact," which feel like forced insertions. Clichés like "heart pounding" and "beacon of hope" reduce the impact of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from cliché ("tight knot in his chest," "winds of change" implied in "wind carry it away," "pieces fell into place") and low information density. Sentences often function as expository bridges ("As a polymer chemist, he understood...") or summaries of mental states, lacking propulsion and specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of keyword phrases ("incise" ~6 times, "glimmering parole" ~5 times, "quantifying absence" ~4 times) creates a mechanical, checklist-like rhythm that breaks immersion. The prose relies heavily on abstract summary ("quantifying the absence of fear") rather than concrete, sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=2.5)
    Forced usage of the word "subsume" leads to repeated, disqualifying grammatical errors ("As he subsume," "He had subsume"). Additionally, the verbatim repetition of long phrases ("analyzing tidal pool formations") creates a disjointed, scaffolded rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose relies on telling via abstract adverbs and adjectives ("empathetically decisive," "harmonious") instead of concrete imagery. Phrasing is often clunky or oxymoronic ("vigorous tender sound"), and the narrative summarizes key interactions (the language interspersing) rather than showing them.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is heavily burdened by filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt," "found herself drawn") and abstract noun-adjective pairings ("chaotically precise," "profound transformation"). Figurative language is often mixed or cliché ("spiderweb of lines," "hues of hope"), and the text relies on telling the reader what is happening emotionally rather than showing it through concrete action. There is a lack of verb strength, with much of the heavy lifting done by modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.3)
    Sentence structures are repetitive and declarative ("Elara was...", "She stood...", "Her motivation was..."), creating a halting rhythm that kills momentum. The prose leans heavily on abstract telling, and the prompt phrase "clandestinely luminous" is inserted awkwardly as a modifier.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose rhythm is severely compromised by the forced repetition of three distinct phrases ("intensely quiet," "symphonically minded," "empathy in motion"), each appearing three to four times in a short text. These artifacts create significant loops and drag, particularly when they clutter the closure. While individual sentences are grammatically sound, the repetitive phrasing reads like a checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("correlate," "silence," "hopeful melancholy") and abstract telling. The writing relies on scaffolded explanations of the magic system rather than concrete action, significantly reducing momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is weighed down by awkward, forced insertions of prompt phrases ("intuitively descriptive," "theatrical sincerity") that disrupt flow. The text relies on telling over showing, with repetitive sentence structures and abstract noun piles.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.0)
    Diction choices are distracting and jarring; "journalize" reads as bureaucratic, and "turning of the tide's thought" is an obscure abstraction. These artifacts disrupt the rhythm and clarity of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is readable but relies heavily on "telling" realizations ("He realized," "He understood"). The repetition of "whirling silence" feels ornamental. Sentence structures are somewhat repetitive (Subject-Verb openers), creating a flat rhythm during action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.4)
    Competent grammar, but the prose is weighed down by clichés ("scattered like confetti," "thick blanket") and abstract nominalizations. The usage of prompt phrases like "hazy precision" feels inserted rather than organic to the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is weighed down by adjective clutter and abstract noun phrases ("oscillating repose," "prism-songs"). Filter verbs and passive constructions rob the narrative of immediacy ("was synchronized with," "was not broken but transformed"). Phrasing often feels like a checklist of prompt words inserted without rhythmic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is weighed down by abstract nouns and forced phrasing, particularly the awkward insertion of "avalanchingly quiet." Sentence structure is repetitive and lacks rhythmic variety, often falling into a "He [verb]..." pattern. The reliance on telling over showing creates a barrier to immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished with strong density and evocative imagery ("mechanism clicking like a falling lock"). However, the pivotal description of the epiphany relies on "symphony" and "infinite complexity," stock descriptors that flatten the peak moment's originality.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is serviceable but marred by clichés ("phantom limb," "breath misting") and repetitive, forced usage of prompt terms like "germinate" and "vibrating sympathetically." The heavy reliance on abstract summary and telling reduces scene density, preventing the imagery from achieving genuine tactile impact.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose relies on high-density cliché usage ("struck her like a physical blow," "tilted on its axis," "hides in plain sight"). Line-level execution is dominated by "telling" constructions ("Elara was," "She intended to") that flatten momentum and distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=2.7)
    The phrase "stoically sparkling" is repeated three times verbatim, including in the final paragraph, creating a severe repetitive artifact that sounds algorithmic. The prose is generally overwrought ("tendrils of nothingness"), prioritizing purple description over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from heavy repetition of key descriptors ("deliberate" appears five times) and monotonous sentence structures ("He [verb]..."). The text relies on abstract summary and filter verbs rather than concrete, active imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and cliché ("loomed like behemoths," "fabric of reality becoming pliable"). Abstract phrasing frequently obscures concrete action ("discover the weight of a withheld truth"). The repetition of the clumsy phrase "cyclically spontaneous" disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is functional but marred by telling ("He understood now") and clunky sentence structures ("Elian's motivation... was to"). The repetition of the specific phrase "luminescent ache" reads as an unintentional artifact rather than a motif.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=2.1)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("total internal reflection" x4, "shadowed elation" x4, "ancient shadows" x4) within a short text creates a glitch-like, artificial rhythm. The prose is cluttered with "tell" statements and lacks syntactic variety, relying on a template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from abstraction ("quiet explosion of understanding," "ethereal wonder") and repetition of prompt phrases as descriptors. The reliance on adjective-heavy telling over concrete imagery slows momentum and blurs the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is dense with filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew," "she saw") and abstract nouns that dilute immediacy. Phrasing often leans on clichés ("heart skipping a beat," "simple yet profound") and summary.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.5)
    Repetitive sentence structures ("Her purpose was...", "Her method was...", "Elara's motivation was clear...") create a monotonous, list-like rhythm. The prose relies heavily on weak "to be" verbs and abstractions, stalling narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is marred by repetitive artifacts and forced phrasing. Specific terms like "enlarged tranquility" and "nestled paradoxes" are repeated three times each in a short space, creating a distracting loop. The writing tells rather than shows, using abstract modifiers instead of concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is grammatically functional but weighed down by abstract summaries and forced phrasing ("uncloak the full history"). There is a heavy reliance on filter verbs ("She perceived," "She noticed," "She believed") and telling, which dilutes the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant deduction for text artifacts; specific phrases ("gently meticulous," "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion," "quartz hush," "while illusions fade to memory") are repeated verbatim, creating a "mad-lib" scaffold effect. These loops, combined with abstract purple prose ("shimmered with a dying light"), severely impact flow and density.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but suffers from the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase ("comforting unease") which breaks immersion. There are instances of overwriting and mixed metaphors ("whispered deals that clung to the shadows like moss"), and reliance on clichés ("shifting sands," "heart pounding").

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished and readable with clear imagery, though it occasionally leans into passive telling ("Her skepticism was a core part..."). The line-level craft is competent but lacks the propulsion or density required for higher bands, often summarizing internal states instead of showing them.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is clogged with clunky prompt insertions ("charcoal-fingered portrait sketch artist," "mnemonically gifted") that disrupt rhythm. Sentences frequently act as scaffolding for required phrases rather than advancing the story organically.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.2)
    While grammatically functional, the prose relies heavily on filtering ("she noticed," "she realized") and cliché descriptors ("strained breath," "painstaking care"). The logical contradiction regarding the map's material (paper vs. zinc) in adjacent sentences indicates a lack of line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from clichéd phrasing ("tears to Elara's eyes," "fabric of reality") and abstract metaphors ("tapestry of sound") that lack sensory bite. "Muted vigor" reads as a slightly clunky oxymoron, and the rhythm remains monotonous throughout the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=3.0)
    The text suffers from severe repetitive looping, with "strangely organic" used three times and "static" five times in a short space. The reliance on summary scaffold ("The plan formed," "He remembered") prevents any density or momentum, resulting in a flat, mechanical rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("shattering the peace," "heavy with history," "flood of cherished memories," "weight lifting from his shoulders") that dull the imagery. The reliance on stock phrasing and abstract summaries prevents the creation of a vivid, tangible texture.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive subject-verb sentence structures ("She worked," "She began," "Her dance"). Abstract nouns and "telling" dominate ("narrated the transformation"), and key phrases are repeated verbatim as artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is functional but marred by adverbs ("mysteriously") and filter verbs; the phrase "gleaming silence" repeats to the point of becoming a text artifact rather than a motif.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=1.4)
    Severe penalty for patterned artifacts: prompt phrases like "terrestrially cosmic" and "smoothed hush" are looped incessantly (5+ times each), destroying prose rhythm. The text is riddled with scaffolded sentences and lacks lexical variety or density.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level execution is marred by diction errors (using "curdled" to mean deepened/transformed rather than spoiled) and clichés ("voice like the wind through an alley"). The reliance on adjective-heavy abstraction ("spectral transparency") reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=2.2)
    Severe repetition artifacts mar the prose; phrases like "tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve," and "translate her isolation" appear verbatim three to four times each in a short space. This looping creates a template-like cadence that destroys immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from awkward keyword insertion ("wisely enduring" as a verb phrase, "action to unlink") and abstract telling. Phrases like "shrouded in mystery and metaphor" are weak telling, and the repetitive sentence structures ("She [verb]...") create a monotone rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=2.6)
    Prose is dominated by "telling," abstract nouns, and repetitive sentence structures that stifle momentum. The forced inclusion of prompt phrases (e.g., using "progressive disclosure" as a diegetic mechanism) disrupts the narrative flow and breaks stylistic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=1.9)
    Severe text loops degrade the prose; "borrowed starlight" appears five times and "weaves truth carefully" three times in a short text. This excessive, verbatim repetition acts as a scaffold that obstructs narrative flow and indicates a lack of line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose suffers from adjective stuffing ("scintillatingly somber") and a repetitive rhythm that drags momentum. The text relies heavily on "telling" the reader the significance of objects rather than showing their impact through action.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose execution is hampered by stock phrasing ("bruised sky," "hours bled," "coalesced from chaos") and repetitive sentence structures. The heavy use of filter verbs ("noted," "caught," "felt") dilutes the immediacy of the character's experience. The line-level craft communicates the plot clearly but lacks density and freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from severe artifact insertion, where prompt instructions ("gritty whimsy," "lyrically prophetic") are pasted directly into the text as descriptors. Metaphors are dense and often mixed ("statement unfolding like a map," "heart a tuning fork"), and the sentence structure relies heavily on static "The [Noun] was [Description]" patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose relies on repetitive sentence structures (many sentences begin with "He [verb]") that create a monotonous rhythm. "Purple" phrasing ("soft sheen of old regrets," "dawn’s earliest whistle") obscures clarity with mixed metaphors and abstract description.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.2)
    Repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("logically emotional," "fleshly ethereal") creates jarring text artifacts that disrupt flow. Pervasive use of filter verbs and "telling" ("motivation was clear") flattens the prose momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is marred by severe repetition of prompt phrases; "softly purposeful," "restrained wildness," and "unyoke" appear multiple times in identical or near-identical constructions. This mechanical looping creates a chant-like monotony that draws attention to the writing process rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from the awkward insertion of required phrases ("Through empirical observation," "fortified vulnerability"), disrupting rhythm and natural syntax. Heavy use of abstract nouns and adjectives ("residue of dust and decay") creates a dense, sluggish flow, and the text relies on "telling" via adverbs rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is severely marred by the verbatim repetition of unique phrases ("vibrant hush" x3, "aptly deliberate" x2, "calm before realization" x2). Additionally, the insertion of "by the way light breaks through storm clouds" results in a syntactically tortured sentence that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose suffers from awkward phrasing and a significant grammar error ("Elara's steadily curiosity") resulting from the forced insertion of prompt keywords. Repetitive sentence openers ("Throughout the evolution...") create a monotonous cadence that draws attention to the story's artificial structure. The line-level logic of the decoding process is abstract to the point of incoherence, relying on word salad rather than grounded detail.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of prompt strings ("sensed absence" x3, "echo of forgotten songs" x2) in a short space. The reliance on "telling" over "showing" reduces density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("curled like smoke," "eyes like sea-glass") and abstract modifiers. The insertion of prompt phrases like "courageous anomaly" creates semantic confusion (attributing courage to ice patterns) that disrupts line-level logic.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe keyword stuffing creates repetitive text loops (e.g., "heirloom lace parasol tip" and "disaster relief volunteering" each repeated three times in full) that destroy prose rhythm. These artifacts read like a checklist, creating a template cadence that obscures the otherwise competent sensory description.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose relies heavily on filtering and summary ("He realized," "He saw," "He recalled"), violating the "show, don't tell" principle. The text is cluttered with explanatory scaffolding ("His motivation was not to dwell..."), and the insertion of specific terms results in clumsy, tell-heavy sentences that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("peripheral awareness" appears five times; "strangely honest," "whisperfield calm," and "kinetic parapet" act as loops). The prose relies on heavy scaffolding ("He knew," "He sensed") instead of immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is heavily overwritten ("visual symphony," "green embrace," "whispered secrets") and relies on filter verbs ("She noticed," "She saw") that distance the reader. Clichés abound in both description and dialogue ("eyes reflecting decades of toil," "smiling through tears"). The rhythm is monotonous, lacking tension-driven variation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from the robotic repetition of specific phrases ("weathered innocence," "suspended hush," "fractured sequences"), which appear three times each, reading like a checklist artifact. Tautologies and heavy modification clutter the sentences, reducing momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("breath on glass," "water through fingers," "evaporated like dew") and abstract noun phrases. These artifacts reduce imagery density and weaken the specific, sensory impact of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from heavy repetition of prompt phrases ("luminous ache" appears four times; "changelessly constant" three times) which creates a mechanical, checklist texture. The reliance on abstract descriptors ("beautiful, painful urgency") over concrete imagery results in "purple" overwriting that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is marred by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("hymning the mundane," "scent of hope," "pulsing stillness"). "Decisively kindness" appears as a grammatical error, and the reliance on clichés flattens the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition artifacts ("quietly deliberate" appears four times; "spoons" three times) flatten the prose rhythm and create a template feel. Phrasing tends toward the expository ("Her motivation... was") rather than active implication.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is often purple and abstract ("carved a cleft in her certainty," "constellation of fireflies"), distancing the reader from concrete experience. The phrase "nostalgic innovation guided her hands" creates a semantic clash (abstract concept performing physical action) that weakens line-level logic.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.5)
    Line-level craft suffers from significant repetition (three uses of "serpentine," three of "memories resurface," four of "weigh/weighed") and grammatical errors caused by forcing prompt phrases. The tense mismatch in "memories resurface" and the clunky insertion of "zephyr bloom" disrupt flow and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose has a smooth rhythm but relies on abstract noun phrases and repeated prompt labels ("honeyed hush," "quietly proactive") that tell rather than show. The density of figurative language occasionally blurs the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from heavy repetition of prompt phrases (&quot;spiral seashell fragment,&quot; &quot;solemnize,&quot; &quot;swirling hush&quot;) which breaks immersion. Phrasing is often clunky to accommodate these elements (e.g., &quot;Inside the whisper of closing pages&quot;), and the reliance on abstract nouns creates a lack of line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is heavily marred by prompt-injection artifacts and meta-commentary ("The core concept of... loomed," "Her motivation was clear," "The method was through"). These constructions break immersion and read like an outline. Additionally, the text relies on clichéd descriptors ("emerald leaves") and repetitive phrases ("golden stories," "gathering hush") that reduce information density.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by clichés ("cold bit into the bone," "stood like sentinels," "world held its breath") and abstract phrasing ("profound silence," "moving stillness"). Information density is low, with many sentences restating the mood or the character's competence without advancing the narrative. The reliance on explaining the significance of actions ("This method... was not mere whimsy") halts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose leans on flowery abstraction and pathetic fallacy ("nursing some deep injury," "echoes lingered like gentle whispers") rather than concrete imagery. The reliance on summary creates a sluggish rhythm devoid of propulsive scene energy.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from severe template cadence in the central section, using a repetitive list structure ("The first was... Next came... Then came...") that destroys momentum. Heavy reliance on abstract nouns and "telling" ("resisted her art," "overwhelm") flattens the imagery and distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition artifacts degrade the prose; "crystallized time" appears five times and "hauntingly practical" three times in a short space, creating a distracting loop. The writing consistently "tells" meaning through abstract nouns rather than "showing" through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant repetition of stock phrases ("eroded ambitions" and "fractured stillness" each appear three times) dulls the prose. The text contains clichés ("sharp as broken glass," "regret washed over her") and a jarring grammatical error ("the chronologically confusion lifted") that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is mechanically competent but suffers from lack of density and reliance on telling summary ("ignited his functionally creative nature"). The pacing drags during the montage, and the language often drifts into purple abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose fails the loop/scaffold screen with severe severity. The multi-word phrase "excruciatingly gentle" is repeated six times in a short text, alongside other loops ("petrichor," "hidden sunrise"), indicating a lack of basic revision and lexical control.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=2.2)
    Severe repetitive looping of key phrases ("training instincts" x5, "architecture of lies" x3, "morning radio" x3) destroys flow and readability. This keyword stuffing creates a robotic cadence and violates the standard for invisible craft, dominating the prose with artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is overwritten with abstract noun-adjective pairings ("oceanic hush," "silent promise," "deep stillness") that dull the imagery. Frequent use of filtering ("she believed," "she understood") creates distance and slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose is dense with abstract metaphors ("scent of decay and resilience," "geography of healing") that obscure rather than clarify. There is a reliance on adjective-heavy description ("vividly descriptive," "slender, faded red") and clichéd imagery ("autumn leaves fell like forgotten memories") that drags the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=2.1)
    Severe repetitive artifacts drag the score down; specific phrases ("hypothesizing about everything," "quaking reverie," "bitterly sweet," "through the discovery") are repeated verbatim multiple times, creating a mechanical, checklist-like cadence. This repetition creates synonym loops that flatten the prose and break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is weighed down by adjective stacking ("gracefully alert poise") and abstract clichés ("song of her scars"). The exact repetition of prompt phrases ("kelp-drift," "migration of clouds") creates a mechanical, scaffolded rhythm that dulls the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is dense with adjectival clutter and mixed metaphors ("prism that refracted certainty into spectra of doubt"). The explicit inclusion of prompt terms like "realistically imaginative" creates jarring semantic collisions that break immersion. The text relies on abstract nouns over concrete verbs, slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose is functional but clunky, often using weak linking verbs ("Her method was sonar pinging") and abstract clichés ("troubling serenity," "silent elegy"). The rhythm is monotonous, and the reliance on "telling" drains momentum from what should be high-stakes moments.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.6)
    Significant repetitive artifacts: the phrase "thundering calm" appears three times, and "fiercely meditative" twice, reading as forced insertions. The prose leans heavily on telling ("Her motivation was...") and abstract nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=2.2)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases (e.g., "tidal obsidian ridge" 4x, "incremental absolution" 3x) creates a robotic, template-like cadence. The prose is riddled with "tell-y" abstractions ("profound clarity," "searing reverie") that distance the reader. A glaring grammatical error ("ethically diligence") appears in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("velveteen gloom," "tenderly organized," "uncharted echoes," "shape of intentions" all appear 3–5 times in a short space) creates a stuttering, artificial rhythm. The prose relies on passive constructions and abstract nouns rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from abstract noun-heavy phrasing ("sturdy fabric of observed reality") and the awkward insertion of prompt terms ("groundedly imaginative nature") that disrupt the rhythm. There is a reliance on telling over showing ("The tone of this endeavor was one of sustaining transformation"), which stalls narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures ("She [verb]...") and a reliance on filter verbs ("she realized," "she felt") that distance the reader. While grammatically competent, the "thistled calm" motif feels forced, and the density of abstract summary prevents scene-level immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is weighed down by alliterative abstractions ("grief and graphite") and explanatory scaffolding ("This was her way of..."). The text frequently tells rather than shows, with prompt phrases inserted verbatim ("acting through incomplete information") in ways that disrupt the natural rhythm and syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant prose artifacts lower the score: prompt phrases ("agonized," "rationally rebellious," "abrasive calm," "competing narratives") are each repeated three times verbatim, creating a mechanical, algorithmic cadence. Sentence structure is monotonous, frequently relying on "Subject + Verb" openings.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is marred by the repetitive, awkward insertion of prompt phrases ("traveled stillness," "across unlearning hatred") which creates rhythm-breaking artifacts. Flowery descriptors ("dancing like tiny spirits") reduce information density, making the text feel decorative rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition artifacts mar the prose; specific phrases ("gentle rebellion," "synaptic plasticity," "informally wise") are looped multiple times within a short text. The writing relies on abstract nouns and filter verbs ("she knew," "she recalled") rather than concrete, immediate imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("clear as the evening star," "woven into the fabric of the night," "pulse like a heartbeat"). Narrative summary ("She had always sought...") replaces active scene work. The dialogue feels unnatural and expository, existing solely to convey plot information rather than character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition artifacts (loops) and forced phrasing. "Streetlights daydream/daydreaming" appears three times, "hushed blaze" twice, and "inadvertently profound" twice in a short space, creating a mechanical stutter. The density of abstract metaphors ("shard of hush," "silent fire") obscures rather than sharpens the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=2.2)
    Severe repetition artifacts degrade the prose; specific phrases like "cascading revelations," "incisively kind," and "structural weakness" appear 3–4 times each in a short space, creating a mechanical, looping cadence. The density of "telling" (explaining thoughts rather than showing action) halts narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("grim optimism" is used as a label twice) and abstract telling ("She was balancedly daring"). The reliance on adjectives over strong verbs dilutes the momentum of the ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies on clichés ("in her mind's eye," "tapestry of human goodness," "beacon in the night") and adjectival clustering ("methodically hopeful") that tells rather than shows. The density of information is low, with several sentences dedicated to summarizing the moral import of the visions rather than advancing the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with good density of image and action. A few phrases lean into standard literary metaphors ("face a map of her displacement"), but the line-level craft efficiently advances the story and maintains the melancholic mood.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally polished, but the text suffers from significant repetitive looping of prompt phrases ("neatly inventive," "latent radiance," "bleak exhilaration," "initiate") which act as visible scaffolding. These repetitions flatten the rhythm and distract from otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from clunky, adjective-heavy phrasing ("photographically cursed," "repulsive allure") and cliché ("gaping maw," "pure white erupted"). The archaic verb "unbosom" is used awkwardly, disrupting the rhythm and feeling forced rather than natural to the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally evocative and sensory-rich, though it occasionally leans into adjective-heavy description ("fragile, luminous dome," "complex, ever-evolving"). There is a tendency to "tell" the magic system's mechanics ("concept of sketched resonance") rather than letting them exist purely as image. Rhythm and momentum are solid.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=4.8)
    Key phrases ("sunwashed dread," "quietly driven") are repeated verbatim, creating a loop artifact. The climax relies on passive construction ("A visible crack... snaked," "a whisper... emerged") and abstract summary rather than concrete, immediate action. The prose tells the reader what to feel rather than evoking the sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from adjective/adverb bloating ("emotionally rational," "specific place," "quiet finality," "clear and fierce"). Sentence structures are repetitive, and the reliance on "telling" over "showing" stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of prompt-specific terms ("wrest," "interlaced absence," "hushed blaze") which creates a checklist feel. Additionally, the line-level craft relies on "tell" artifacts like the adverb-adjective construction "stoically sensitive" and mixed metaphors ("core of deep-feeling silt").

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is weighed down by "telling" artifacts and definition sentences ("Her motivation was singular"). The integration of prompt phrases is clumsy, resulting in awkward constructions like "Her resolve was dappled" that disrupt the rhythm and clarity of the line.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is functional but marred by significant scaffolding and "telling" artifacts (e.g., "The attribute of descending while ascending manifested again," "Her motivation was clear"). These meta-commentary phrases break immersion and treat narrative elements as checklist items rather than organic parts of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from adjective-heavy telling ("desperate, gnawing need") and the awkward insertion of required phrases ("intangibly tangible"). The repetition of the unique phrase "bleak exhilaration" (once in the middle, once at the end) reads as a loop rather than a purposeful refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is readable but cluttered with clichés ("missing pieces fell into place," "profound sense") and abstract nouns. The repeated use of the oxymoron "brilliant dimness" feels clunky. There is little rhythmic variety, with many sentences following a standard subject-verb-object pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from repetitive looping of prompt phrases ("quell" and "sieved hush" each appear three times) and reliance on clichés ("air thick," "crashed down," "heavier than any stone"). These artifacts and the high density of abstract emotional labels stifle the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.5)
    Line-level logic breaks occur, notably "The wind howled... a furrowed hush" (a howl is not a hush). The prose relies on adjective stacking ("storm-worn windblown") and clichés ("shed a heavy coat"), reducing the density and freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from severe, pervasive repetition of specific phrases (e.g., "merrily melancholic," "backlash of regrets" appear ~4 times each in a short space), creating a distractingly artificial template cadence. The final paragraph lists nearly every keyword in rapid succession, destroying narrative flow and density.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("clean slate," "stubborn stain") and visible scaffolding where prompt phrases are pasted in verbatim ("delicately robust," "jaded wonder" both appear twice). These repetitions act as text artifacts that break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from "purple" abstraction ("aroma like lost sunrises") and heavy filtering ("she felt," "she faced"). A high density of predictable adjective-noun pairings slows momentum and obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is functional but marred by repetitive usage of prompt words ("unfasten," "choking beauty") that creates a noticeable echo. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she understood") distance the reader from the climax of the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing ("ghostly resolve" appears in paragraphs 1 and 6; "profound" modifies both sadness and silence) dulls the prose's impact. The reliance on telling emotions ("unshakable happiness," "consumed her") creates a filter that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract telling ("understood the texture," "felt a profound peace") and clichés ("evaporated like morning dew," "flickering like tiny heartbeats"). Filter verbs ("realized," "knew," "felt") dilute immediacy, creating a summary effect rather than a vivid scene.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetitive artifacting disrupts the prose; specific phrases like "winking hush," "calmly inventive," and "cradle of sparks" are repeated verbatim multiple times as explicit tags. The prose relies heavily on "telling" via adjectives ("vigilant," "oppressive," "innocently") rather than showing through action, resulting in a sluggish, declarative rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is functional but marred by telling artifacts ("His motivation was pure") and expository summaries of action. The physics logic gaps (hovering dust vs. sliding world) create distraction at the line level, and abstract nouns replace concrete depiction in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is functional but laden with clichés ("masks would slip," "raw emotion") and purple phrasing ("furiously tranquil"). Rhythms are repetitive, and the text relies on abstract nouns over concrete verbs. Line-level craft is marred by "tell-heavy" constructions that summarize emotional states instead of evoking them.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from repetitive tagging; the phrase "dignified chaos" (or variations) appears three times, becoming a crutch rather than a motif. Metaphors are often mixed or cliché ("poised like a scorpion's tail," "shards that danced"). The text tells the reader what to feel ("serene and charged") instead of evoking those sensations through concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("companionable silence," "beacon in the night," "unshaken") and purple abstractions ("incandescent possibility"). Figurative language is decorative and frequently interrupts the scene's momentum to deliver authorial commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by "telling" artifacts and abstract phrasing ("motivation was simple, yet immense"). Required phrases like "strategically creative" and "steely longing" are inserted as blunt labels that disrupt the narrative flow. Sentence structures become repetitive in the middle section, creating a rhythmic monotony that dulls the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("luminous doubt" x3, "fantasy island" x4) and a lack of density. Abstract nouns clutter the sentences, and the "As she [verb]... she [verb]" sentence structure creates a monotonous rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is laden with filter verbs ("He felt," "He realized," "He understood") and abstract metaphors that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The prompt phrase "rhythmically placid" is inserted awkwardly into dialogue, and the reliance on "telling" the emotional state prevents the imagery from doing the work. The writing is technically functional but suffers from "purple" tendencies like "cerulean regret" that obscure rather than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    Repetitive motif loops ("blooming resistance," "forge beauty from anarchy," "rebuild") across beats create paraphrase churn without pressure gain, dulling propulsion. Dense images strong, but overwriting metaphors (e.g., "luminous fracture") strain in peak reflection; rhythm varies.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in projector whir-to-door beat; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in arbor metaphors ("pulsed with rhythmic light") slightly blurs peak entry but doesn't dull closure image. Clean propulsion to final note.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate in final third (e.g., repeated "cultural memory safe," "ridge would bloom again," "cycle would repeat"), dulling closure propulsion; template cadence in successive assurances triggers heavy deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies with scene (short steps in walk, breathing prose post-rain); density high, metaphors purposeful (e.g., mist intentions). Minor artifact: echoed "slow/placid" phrasing near start, but no loops dull closure. Propulsion clear to locket image.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: high density, no scaffold loops, varied sentence rhythm. Figurative language is sparse, accurate—“mud-smeared glass and shattered dreams” risks cliché but is instantly redeemed by the next scientific clause. No simultaneity errors or mixed metaphors. Minor −0.2 for one “stock” pairing (“shattered dreams”) that momentarily slackens texture.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean, with high information density; most sentences do two jobs (e.g., “scorched testament” fuses object + metaphor). One paraphrase loop detected: “she had retraced…to retrace the events” within 30 words; minor, does not obscure causality. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for frost observation, clipped for逃生 memory—matching tempo shift.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentences vary. Information density high—one line often fuses sensory, emotional, symbolic work. Figurative layering risks purple drift in para-4 (“silence fell like a permanent shroud”), but pattern is taught early and pays off. Two paraphrase loops (“unshaken marvels” 3×, “rectify” 6×) dull momentum; −0.4 keeps closure intact.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean, evocative, and mostly propulsive; sentences carry double duty. Occasional overwriting—“quietude perpetually fleeing ahead of him,” “thick, dark quilt”—and a few paraphrase loops (“the weight of the lens… puzzling companion… whispered of the sea”) nudge it off 8+ territory. No line-level artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong rhythm: paragraph lengths swell and contract with mission tempo. No scaffold loops; however, four consecutive sentences in the final paragraph open with “The…” creating template cadence. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“moon rise over weathered arches”). Minor tightening needed to remove two adjectives (“humid night air” → “wet air”).

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes with the scene: clause length literally expands and contracts to mimic inhale/exhale without drum-beat repetition. Figurative vehicles (wisteria as incense, sparks as unmailed letters) are spare, consistent, and paid off. No paraphrase loops; every sentence either advances the next strand-discovery or re-tones the air. One strained mixed metaphor—“forgotten tide” beside “sealed letter”—prevents 9.0, but it does not touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty: “She adjusted the maze’s layout, introducing hyperbolic folds that twisted space into non-repeating patterns” simultaneously advances plot, exhibits craft, and seeds the payoff. Figurative language is selective—“ghost-light of centuries” is the single metaphor for the shard—and avoids purple accretion. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new visual or tactile information. Minor scaffold appears in the repeated “she walked / she stood” openings, but the pattern breaks under the pressure of the disintegration beat.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paragraph rhythm varies; information is doubled in places (“abandoned carnival prize redemption center stood silent… its faded banners fluttered like ghosts” could halve). Metaphor density spikes in climactic planting paragraph—three metaphors in four sentences—without prior pattern, reading as purple overlay. Several scaffold phrases (“staggering grace” x4, “patiently strategic” x2) recycle instead of deepen. Read-aloud ear is fluid, but synonym churn (“staggering grace,” “unwavering hope,” “ultimate liberation”) dulls precision.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety strong; no template cadence runs. Figurative language is patterned early (“memories clung like salt”) and paid off, avoiding density penalty. Mixed metaphor risk—“colors screamed… a cacophony of blues and golds”—but stays within synesthetic rule set, so waived. Zero scaffold; every sentence layers salt, rust, or aurora data. High information density: “she calibrated a device, aiming to capture the precise frequency of faith dissolving” does three jobs—action, motive, stake—in 19 words.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density: “pigment swirling to reveal not a past memory, but a possible future” does triple duty—visual, thematic, foreshadow. Few modifiers are wasted; metaphors stay coherent (moonbeam as smoke). One scaffold loop: “luminous disbelief” repeated thrice without escalation; mild. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. No artifact touches the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with furnace heat; sentence lengths vary, paragraph cuts tight. Few metaphors, but “molten pearl” and “great fire awakens” tilt toward elevated diction; one mixed vehicle (“thawing heart of the landscape”) momentarily blurs physical logic. No paraphrase loops, but “contemplative” and “thoughtfully spirited” repeat as labels. Otherwise high density, clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense: one sentence often does two jobs (“clutching the whispering seashell half—a cracked, pearlescent heirloom…”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (rust, ivy, stars). Occasional elevated phrasing (“sibilant urgings coil”) is brief and voice-motivated. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge; paragraph cut test passed.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with the ritual pace; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layering is disciplined—one metaphor per beat, no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated phrase (“ambered hush”) is voice-motivated and stays legible. The only nit is slight scaffold in “she retold the silence of…” used thrice; not enough to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is mostly clean and vivid (“bow made of frozen light”) with high information density; metaphors are coherent. A few paraphrase loops (“its task complete… stood in serene silence”) repeat content without added pressure. No mixed metaphors or register drift; sentence variety is healthy. Artifacts appear but not in the final third, so 9+ is not disallowed.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences breathe with varying cadence; no loops or scaffold. Occasional stacked modifiers (“crystal whispering forecourt after rain”) flirt with purple, but each image forwards mood or mechanic, never stalls motion. Clean grammar; opening and closing lines anchor and release cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies from short horticultural commands to longer rolling clauses that mimic vine growth. Figurative control high: “blooming withering” oxymoron sustains without overwriting. Two paraphrase loops—“gardens know their gardeners” / “garden knew its gardener”—and one synonym pair (“elaborately” twice in four lines) slightly stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Information density is high—each sentence advances either setting, character, or concept. Metaphors are sparse and clean; the single mixed risk “hush of beating wings at rest” is justified by alien biology and paid off at closure. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, propulsive, and free of scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: one sentence often does setting, emotion, and metaphor—“water dripped…with a soft plink” layers sound, atmosphere, and ticking clock. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative control tight: “chest-high water” literal yet metaphorically baptismal; no mixed metaphors. Minor over-modifier in “unstable light reflecting off the dark, stagnant surface,” but clarity intact. Closure line is crisp, image-driven, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.3)
    Paragraph rhythm breathes with beats; sentence openings vary and avoid template cadence. Figurative phrases (“auroral sorrow,” “stone in her throat”) are spare and earned, never stacked. One paraphrase loop (“she had learned to smudge the lines… by occupying margins”) repeats concept without fresh detail; otherwise density is high. No grammar or pronoun drift; copy is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences do double duty: “his headlamp cutting a frail beam through the absolute dark” anchors space and mood. No scaffold loops; metaphors are sparse and mechanical, matching POV. Strong verbs (“crunching,” “glinted”) carry motion. One paraphrase echo: “weight of a swallowed truth” appears twice—minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences breathe with variable length; strong verbs (“clung,” “yawned,” “mend”) carry image. Occasional stacked abstractions (“weight of forgotten tales,” “symphony of quiet endings”) flirt with overwriting, but none cloud causality or dull the final image. No loops, no scaffold; diction stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; each sentence adds archival or bodily detail without paraphrase. Metaphors are coherent—“brittle as autumn leaves” aligns with burnt diary ash. Information density is high: “diaries accounts of skies tearing and stars falling” delivers world-quake in nine words. Rhythm modulates from slow caesura of “bronze quiet” to the forward rush of “stories flowed,” propelling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm modulates: long anaphoric swells build, then snap to monosyllabic row/drop/flash for momentum. Information density high—one line can layer sensory cue, plot step, motif echo. Occasional scaffold—“she orchestrated her liberation not through force, but by directing the flow”—restates prior sentence; one mixed metaphor “transpose her life into a new key” jars physical logic yet is saved by musical motif taught early. No loops near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, zero filter-verb stacks, every sentence advancing image or causality. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“unraveled stillness” returns in mutated form), and never muddies logic. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“simple, unadorned reality, secured”) that recharges the blue mark and silence motif.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory memory, musical notation, and metaphor. No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Figurative language is coherent under accumulative lens, but three adjacent “memory of” phrases in mid-section create template cadence (−0.2). Final third is clean; no artifact touches closure. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve via image, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “She traced the rim…its surface cool and waiting, like her own heart” fuses touch, simile, and interior state in one clause. No scaffold, no mixed metaphors; drum/needle imagery stays coherent. Variation in sentence length creates inhalation/exhalation rhythm matching listening scenes. Final line cadence—“always new, always alive”—earns its parallelism by echoing reversed motion.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: rain-gauge adjustment doubles as calm gesture and plot cue. Scaffolding minimal; only “layered tranquility” repeats without early pattern-teaching, minor. Strong verbs (fetch, cross-reference, devise) dominate. No mixed metaphors; weather imagery stays coherent. Final line cadence mirrors dusk-to-night transition effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; no template churn. Information density high—e.g., “crystal shadows danced under the filtered sun” does three jobs in eight words. Two adjacent near-repeats: “transformation completed as the blossom shed its pollen” echoes prior “transformation was underway”; mild loop, −0.2. No strained metaphors; register consistent. Closing line lands with punch.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: almost every sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work—e.g., “Its fibers held the memory of a desperate climb and the taste of a freedom he had never fully grasped.” No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay internally consistent. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for awe, staccato for the climb memory. Final line lands cleanly without overwriting, letting image carry resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong verbs and varied sentence length carry momentum; minor loop (“the chronic hush remained…”) and occasional stacked modifiers (“sunken orchard greenhouse, its glass dome…”) keep it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences multi-task (light/shadow “danced like silent patrons” sets tone + stakes). No paraphrase loops; only “transformation completed” repeats three times, a −0.3 template cadence. Metaphors are coherent—electricity as emotional Geiger counter. Opening line anchors voice and concept; final line (“blotter petal…crumbled into dust”) resolves with tactile cost. Density is high; every paragraph advances knowledge or charge. Hairline slip keeps it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clean, readable, with mild syntactic variety; no grammar faults. Recurrent stock phrases (“breezy library under the stars,” “cycles of compassion”) create template cadence; four mentions in 800 words feel scaffolded. Figurative language is sparse and safe; no mixed metaphors, but also no high-density compression. Line-level competence supports momentum without standout texture.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify.  Occasional elevated latinate diction (“pervasive, luminous silence”) edges above POV lexicon but momentary.  No mixed metaphors; reed/arboreal imagery stays coherent.  One paraphrase loop: “webs of kinship” repeated with near-synonyms in two adjacent sentences—minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; metaphor clusters are deliberate rather than algorithmic. One paraphrase loop: “borrowed time… sculpting time… time bent” within four lines; minor. Information density high; most sentences layer setting, action, consequence. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closure image remains clear. Line artifacts do not touch final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm accelerates with drip count, then exhales into longer reflective clauses—economical propulsion. No mixed metaphors; vehicles (orchard as circuit, mosaic as PCB) stay consistent with tech-mystic fusion. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory data, theory note, and emotional corollary. Only niggle: “dovetail” verb repetition four times; still reads as intentional motif binding joints rather than synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero scaffold loops; no synonym churn. Sentences carry double duty: “The sapphire hush deepened as the voice filled the room” advances both atmosphere and plot beat. Metaphors are sparse, coherent, and physics-loyal. Opening and final lines echo without mechanical symmetry, creating cadence payoff. Figurative language never obscures causality; high density maintained without purple drag.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence advances stance or atmosphere; no scaffold. Metaphors are consistent—storm, moss, leaf—without mixed-vehicle clutter. Rhythm accelerates into the release beat, then softens into acceptance. One paraphrase loop of “transformation” stems costs −0.2, but it never touches the closure image. Clean copy, vivid nouns/verbs, no hedges.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lean for 600-word scope; only one paraphrase loop (“the brooch seemed to pulse… he felt a strange pull”) costs −0.2. Metaphors are coherent—rain as ghost/guide—without mixed logic. Opening sentence anchors voice and stake; final line recharges amber image. Sentence variety is good; no template cadence. Occasional elevated diction (“haggard awe,” “thresh meaning”) fits Kaelen’s artistic lexicon and is earned. No scaffold, typo, or simultaneity error. Density high: every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax; no template cadence runs. Mixed-metaphor risk (“symphony of light and sound”) is acceptable because pattern is taught early and paid off. One paraphrase loop: “magnify everyday magic” / “magnify the faint magic” within 40 words costs −0.2. Information density is high; each sentence advances image or stakes. Closure line is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is largely clean: high sensory density without purple overload, strong verbs (“gleamed, dripping, clicked, sifting”). One scaffold pair detected: “fragments into meaning” / “scatter of records” within 3 sentences—minor loop, not near closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beat. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally lean and image-rich; most sentences do two jobs (action + metaphor). Sparse loops: “mist-shrouded…swirling vapors” is near-repetition but spaced; no paraphrase churn inside beats. Metaphors stay internally consistent (“arrows converge,” “stars align”). Minor scaffold: “she knew,” “she felt” filters appear but never cluster. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve cleanly. One mixed metaphor hiccup—“frozen tears lined the walls” (tears as architectural?)—but clarity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify without algorithmic drift. Information density high—one line can do world, body, and stakes: “The tile was cold against her palm, its symbols whispering of entangled memories.” No mixed metaphors; whales/migration imagery stays coherent. One paraphrase loop spotted (“memories flowed... memories flowing”) but does not touch closure; minor.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences fold setting, physics, and metaphor (“magnetic fields…prying open a gap in the fabric of everything”). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the refraction motif. One mixed metaphor—“violent ballet of plasma”—is forgivable at 750 words. Final line lands with crystalline snap: “a hushed thunder in his soul.”

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences triple-duty (scene, interior, symbol) e.g., “vintage ink pot, tarnished silver and dried crimson inside.” Figurative language sparse; when used (“ideas flowed like water”) it pays off closure image. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase. Sentence openings varied; paragraph cuts tight. Proofing clean; tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, and artifact-free; no synonym loops or scaffold sentences. Figurative load is high (“gilded-leaf,” “blooming labyrinth”) yet each metaphor is tethered to Elian’s craft or the setting’s scale, so density feels earned. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for ascent, clipped fragments at the moment of capture. Opening and closing lines are resonant bookends that recharge “textures” and “symphony” without sounding epigrammatic.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean, high-density; every sentence layers image and stakes without scaffold. Varied sentence cadence mirrors tide inhale/exhale; no template churn. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“metallic canyons” never contradict container scale. One mixed image (“drifting ash” beside industrial port) is minor enough to keep below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences breathe with cello pulses. High information density: single lines carry metaphor, memory, and prop state. No loops, no filter stacks, no mixed metaphors. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via image (“ghost of joy in the melancholy stillness”). Minor scaffold: “gloomy cheerfulness” repeated twice—acceptable as motif, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lean sentences, high density: “The raft city…crowded by a perpetual carnival” packs world, motion, tone in one. No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphor. Occasional mild adjective uplift (“vibrant, defiant magenta”) but color serves thematic coding. Final line cadence mirrors opening, closing bracelet neatly. Prose never slows momentum; readability instant.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is lean: no scaffolding, no paraphrase loops, each sentence either moves body, advances chemistry, or reframes light. Figurative control disciplined—only “sea of change” risks cliché but is saved by immediate physical anchor of palm-held grain. Rhythm modulates with light: long clauses in starlight, staccato clicks at dawn. Opening line anchors both vocation and stake: “Elara was a crater inspector” launches us into motion without throat-clearing; final line seals data and emotion in one cold canister—closure image complete.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence variety is good; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layer is restrained—three metaphors across 700 words—so density never clots. One paraphrase loop: “decode the feedback… into direction” appears twice in adjacent sentences. Otherwise propulsion is clean, with strong tactile verbs (“traced,” “released,” “soared”).

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences perform double duty: “Steam curled from the stone, melting the surrounding snow into a small, nascent stream” advances plot, sets temperature, and textures the lakebed. No scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors; modifiers are sparse, nouns specific (“rusted outpost,” “pallid sky”). Rhythm accelerates across the lake walk, then exhales into the quiet final image. One tiny register lift—“singular convergence”—reads earned because it is the phrasebook’s quoted term, not authorial inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is spare yet musical; no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges the rhythm motif. Information density high—“dust devils danced in silence” does three jobs in five words. Minor drumbeat repetition of “infinitely patient” is the single hairline slip that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence fronts; information often dual-purpose (“the temple’s grand architecture spoke of a lost civilization” advances both world and mood). Occasional modifier stacks (“lonesome splendor… decaying majesty”) verge on purple but stay tethered to Kaelen’s awe. No scaffold loops; metaphors internally coherent. Proofing clean.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors are spare and consistent (tapestry of distrust, fabric of life). Information density high: “the prison hummed with the action of hover” collapses setting, threat, and mythic rule into eight words. No mixed metaphors in peak beats; closure image is clean, unpadded.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is textured yet disciplined: no loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“resonant awakenings spread”) skirts purple but remains in POV lexicon. High information density; rhythm breathes with scene temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences breathe—length varies, openings rotate, no template runs. A few soft qualifiers (“seemed to sigh,” “felt the orchid solace”) cushion what could be sharper, but they fit the dream-logic mode. Metaphors are coherent (labyrinth as sleeping body) and do not collide. No loops, no scaffold, no synonym churn; information density is high. Could compress two near-restatements of “broken precedents,” but the redundancy does not obscure causality or dull the final glow.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm modulates naturally between long breathy clauses and fragmentary percussive beats (“She dug. Found. Read.”). Three near-identical openings (“She…”) create a minor template cadence, but the pattern breaks before the closure image. Figurative language is spare and germane—no mixed metaphors or synonym churn—maintaining momentum across 744 words.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly propulsive, but suffers micro-looping: “carefully inventive” is repeated twice in identical phrasing, and “juxtapose” appears four times in 700 words, dulling impact. Metaphors are coherent (golden corridor) but safe; no mixed vehicles. No scaffolding sentences or filter-verb stacks. Minor redundancy keeps it from high-band density.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm accelerates across the final third: clauses shorten, verbs strengthen—“She had to act.” No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new causal or tactile detail. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“shadows that mimicked constellations”—never crowding urgency. Line-level artifacts zero; flame, thread, and darkness remain physically consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence performs at least two jobs (world-building + interiority, or metaphor + stakes). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (moonlight as knitting needle, letters as rustling birds). One minor overwrite: “chorus of longing that vibrated in the humid air” approaches purple, but beat is brief and doesn’t touch closure. Final line lands with rhythmic snap—“a gentle companion on her new road”—that recharges earlier moon motif.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies, figurative layering is purposeful; no synonym loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrasing (“twilight space where the glass ceiling held the evening's bruised purple light”) risks purple but stays tethered to POV’s softened perception.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong image density but figurative runs stack in climactic beats (“ghostly orchard…dappled shade…phantom bloom”) without taught pattern, costing immediacy. Occasional scaffold: “the joy she sought was not… / the joy was not lost…” paraphrases within three lines. Pronoun and tense clean; spatial sequencing accurate. Final line earns keep—recharges fog/canvas motif.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long sentences for suspension, fragments for coin toss. Loops: “nested awakening” phrase recurs but serves pattern, not scaffold. One mixed metaphor: “web of sound” beside “suspension of coin” reads slight, but clarity intact. No filter-verb stacks; props tracked cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose keeps high density: “She shook the gourd rattle seed, its sound a call to arms” fuses action, object, metaphor in one stroke. No filter-verb clusters; verbs are strong (“scattered,” “burst,” “stumble”). Mixed but coherent metaphor—greenhouse “breathed,” time “stutter”—fits sci-fi warp premise; vehicles don’t collide. One paraphrase loop: “converging chaos” three times; isolated, doesn’t stall final image. Sensory layering (humid, iridescent, dry rattle whisper) braided through motion, not listed. Opening anchors voice/stakes; final line re-seeds motif, satisfying cadence shift. Proofing clean, no tense drift, pronouns clear amid multi-ally scramble. Well above publishable floor; only micro-loop keeps from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    High figurative density risks purple fatigue, but pattern is taught and accrual is purposeful; only isolated mixed metaphor (“reef-shadow joy filtered through memory”) mildly jars. No loops or synonym churn; each recurrence of “half-sung lullabies” adds semantic layer. Sentence rhythm varies, paragraph length modulates to mirror hush-crescendo. Closure line clean, propulsive, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is fluid and sensory, but overwritten streaks persist: stacked epithets (“shimmering, opalescent codexes,” “translucent petal”) appear in successive sentences without pattern-teaching, diluting urgency. Metaphors mostly cohere yet one mixed image (“clouds below resembled a sea of frozen milk”) slightly jars physical logic. No template cadence or paraphrase loops, and high information density is maintained. Artifacts do not touch closure, but the ornamental flourish keeps it from highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythmic control: paragraph lengths visually mirror tension—short paragraph for vow #5 beat. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new causal or sensory information. Metaphors stay physically coherent (“ink overflowed with light” parallels “archive seemed to breathe”). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“the silence breaking”) that recharges the ink-well motif.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“the building breathes”) and paid off. No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences. Minor over-prettifying in the final paragraph (“stars emerged…lullaby for the dormant giant”) keeps it just outside the 9-band, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: lines advance atmosphere plus motive simultaneously (“each flight a thread in the web”). Figurative language is selective—dust as constellation, songs as echo—without crowding high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected; paragraph breaks track emotional breath. Opening and closing sentences anchor and recharge the dust/skylight motif, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs—longer sentences for submerged calm, clipped fragments when she spots the swarm. No scaffolding loops; “burnt feather” returns only when meaning re-weights. Metaphors stay coherent (phoenix myth tied to actual warmth). Opening line could be sharper, but closing line earns its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.1)
    Ear-skimming rhythm, varied sentence shapes, low scaffold; occasional “conjecture” repetition and soft abstract qualifiers (“some,” “might,” “seemed”) diffuse intensity. Metaphors remain coherent within the geode’s physics; no mixed vehicles. Density high, momentum steady, but a few paraphrase loops (“paths disappeared… disappearance is transformation”) dull the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is supple; sentence openings vary. Occasional softeners (“seemed to,” “appeared to”) cushion imagery but don’t stall momentum. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. One paraphrase loop: “she stepped into the growing darkness, her mind already weaving new patterns of serendipity” repeats prior sentence’s gist—minor.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud cadence breathes with ritual; clauses lengthen then fragment under pain. Some metaphor stacking (“blanket of emerging stars,” “obsidian grace”) verges on purple but pattern is taught and serves climax; no loops or scaffold obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “dawn bled light across the water” compresses time and color in four words. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or concept. Metaphors stay coherent under optical logic—glass, water, light—never mixed. One tiny filter stack (“she watched, her breath still”) is forgiven because rhythm demands the pause before spectral explosion.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density—single sentences carry memory, metaphor, and motion: “cracked porcelain box…symbolized both fracture and wholeness.” Occasional micro-scaffold: “each step was a meditation, each breath an effort” restates the same idea twice; small −0.2. Mixed metaphors avoided; celestial dance and glowing box stay coherent. One homophone-level risk: “lead” used correctly. Final line propels outward, no drag. Rhythm ear-test passes; no algorithmic pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is musical and compressed; most sentences carry double duty (image + causality). Minor artifacts: “trial balloons… Each one was a question, a hypothesis…” is a paraphrase loop; “patterned-artifact” −0.3 applied. Mixed metaphors—“silent desperation” across timelines—are abstract but do not tangle causality. Filter-verb stacks absent; no clarity loss at closure. Overall rhythm serves accumulative swell without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative layer is dense—almost every sentence carries metaphor—but the pattern is taught early and sustains the lyric mode, so density is earned. A few minor over-writes (“dusky harmony” twice) but none touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is largely loop-free; sentences advance triple duty—image, interior, pressure. Minor scaffold: “manufactured drought” repeated twice early could compress once; “fractured grace” echoed three times edges template cadence but serves motif. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with paragraph breaks; final line leaves resolute echo.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.1)
    High-density lines do triple duty (world-building, interiority, metaphor); no scaffold loops. A single mixed image—“alarming serenity”—is flagged, but it is intentional oxymoron, not figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence lengths modulate, no paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks appear in peak beats. Metaphors stay coherent (“story stick guiding gestures like a conductor’s baton”). Some abstraction clusters (“ethical storytelling… moral weight… dominant tales”) verge on concept-labeling, dulling immediacy in two spots, but never enough to obscure causality or final image. Density remains high; each paragraph advances knowledge or stance. Clean copy—no typos or pronoun drift—keeps the score just above the median 7-band floor.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from long inhalations of description to clipped, heartbeat fragments at climax. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or action. Metaphors (“blushing stillness”) are coherent and paid off. Minor density of figurative language in one beat prevents 9.0 but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid, rhythmic, and mostly lean; sentences advance image or motive. Occasional lyrical clusters (“snowmelt ardor” twice, “luminescent remembrance”) flirt with purple but never stall causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. One mixed metaphor—“cradle of rediscovery” jars slightly against icebound architecture—keeps it from 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences perform atmosphere, interiority, and plot beat (“She pressed the disintegrating wafer seal…wall shimmered”). No loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent (storm-as-catalyst, not destruction). Rhythm breathes with pressure—sentence length contracts at gateway moment. Clean grammar; opening line anchors voice and stake.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clean, but occasional modifiers stack—“soft, internal light,” “seamless gradient”—and two near-restatements (“encrypted devotion…coded into architecture”) create mild paraphrase loops. Closure beat itself is uncluttered, preserving momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm is musical, yet figurative language slips into mixed metaphors ("sinking stone in a flowing stream"). Filter stacks are light, but near-paraphrase occurs: "resentment began to dissolve, released into the soundless void" restates the same motion. Sentence variety is adequate; paragraphing tight. No fatal artifacts, yet no line-level brilliance that heightens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences carry double duty (action + image) and avoid loops; “bloom of apples and decay of stone” compresses scent and theme in one stroke. Occasional elevated diction (“deciduous vows,” “conceptual repricing”) fits Elara’s craft-philosophy lens. Zero grammar slips; prop states (ribbon, quartz shards) tracked cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; sentences vary in length and opening. A few near-adjacent echoes (“simply complicated,” “nonlinear inheritance”) recur as thematic refrain rather than scaffold, so they read intentional. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops; closure image is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, high density: “volumes piled high into the misty peaks” does two jobs. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (“unheard symphony”) are limited, coherent, pattern-taught early. Closing sentence lands with varied cadence, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean, high density; sentences double-duty (image + interiority). Minor loop: “narrative threads” phrase repeated four times without new inflection (−0.3). Mixed metaphors (“garden bloom like flowers”) are cliché-adjacent but brief. No artifact touches closure; read-aloud rhythm varies. Precision keeps it above 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is scaffold-free: no paraphrase loops, no template cadence, every sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse, surgical—“visual static that defied logic”—and never clusters to clog the high-stakes beat. Rhythm accelerates with parataxis as the rope glows, then exhales into longer cadence when the study solidifies, mirroring the ontological weld. Opening and closing lines are perfect bookends: “adaptable archivist” vs. “complex made clear,” a sonic click that recharges the title’s promise.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, tactile, and mythic data without scaffold. Metaphors (ice as frozen tears, bloom of hush) stay coherent and grounded. No loops or synonym churn; clauses vary naturally. Opening and closing lines bookend with stone glow, achieving circular ear-test satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm climbs from low wind-hum to staccato beat matches the mounting tension; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors (“thistle-blown hope,” “shard of hush”) and both return to charge closure. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances angle, memory, or sensation. One near-scaffold “she realized” is offset by immediate sensory payoff, so artifact does not touch the climax. High density: “blood on silica” simultaneously shows injury, stakes, and material fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“whispers rose like steam”), and paid off at closure. High information density: each sentence layers memory, body, and tool. One coherence nit—stormlit observatory “pulsed with soft internal light” borders on atmospheric cliché, but does not occlude closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: “petals unfurling in the fading light” does triple duty—visual, temporal, foreshadowing bloom. No scaffold loops; each sentence either advances ignition logistics or deepens mood. Metaphors stay coherent within fire lexicon—flame as “transient flower,” explosions as “defiant chord”—so density never clutters clarity. Final line “night…hummed with the memory of light” earns its poetic lift because the prior beats have trained the reader to accept sonic afterglow as real effect.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean: zero paraphrase loops, no template cadence; figurative language is spare and tide-specific. Information density high—one sentence often layers sensory detail, emotional state, and metaphor (“texture of time here—it was gritty like sand, yet fluid like the incoming tide”). No mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are anchored and resonant. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt,” “she saw”) but they serve chronicler stance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative language is sparse, deliberate: “slowly closing fist” appears once and earns its keep. High information density—each sentence advances setting, character, or stakes. No mixed metaphors; “intangibly tangible” is the concept’s name, not a muddle. Copy is clean; no typos or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, and high information density—lines often do two jobs (e.g., “The gondola drifted onward, its motion smooth and relentless” advances plot while re-cadencing hush). Minor template cadence in “She… She… She…” triplet mid-story (−0.2). No strained metaphors or loops; “vaulting hush” is precisely coined. Clean grammar and spatial tracking; the prose never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clean but leans on abstract intensifiers (“magnificent,” “mesmerizing”) and stacked adjectives. No loops or mixed metaphors, yet information density is moderate—some sentences do only one job.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythmic control is strong: sentence length varies with respiratory cadence, propelling the lyric accumulation. Only two paraphrase loops (“loaded emptiness” echoed) and one therapy-speak phrase (“shared wounds”) slightly dull the peak; -0.2 applied. Metaphors stay coherent—bridges/ash/breath—without mixed vehicles. No filter-verb clusters or template cadence. Final image is clean, uncluttered, and earns its pause.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density: “soft, ethereal light…casting shifting blue and green patterns” does three jobs (sensorial, tonal, foreshadowing spectrum of diamond). Rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are crisp. Two minor loops: “pressure…pressure” in adjacent sentences mid-climax; “glitchy text messages” phrase repeats unchanged. No mixed metaphors; clarity holds at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluid, with varied sentence lengths and strong auditory cadence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. A few stacked metaphors in peak memory beat verge on purple but do not obscure causality. Opening and closing images are crisp; middle paragraph drifts into repeated “golden shadows” without new charge.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is vivid but leans on stacked modifiers (“luminescent fruits… factually mystical light”) that slow high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops, yet “shivering bliss” is repeated without escalation, dulling the final cadence. Metaphors stay coherent—strings, puppets, orb—avoiding mixed vehicles. A single filter-verb cluster (“seemed to pulse, seemed to ripple”) appears mid-scene, just under the 9+ disqualifier.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    High information density—each sentence layers archival process with emotional stakes. No loops or synonym churn; “dust” recurs with purpose. Metaphors (dust = palimpsest) stay coherent. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge motif. Minor scaffold: repeated “small kindness” phrasing near end (−0.2). Closure image untouched; keeps high band.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are clean. No loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“auric lagoon,” “coded freedom”—without purple overload. Information density is high; each sentence advances image or action. Opening and closing lines are crisp, with the final “ripple” line supplying propulsive send-off.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong auditory and tactile specificity (“brass cool against his fingers”) keeps lines propulsive. Repetitive phrase stem “dewdrops formed” recurs six times, a cadence template that borders loop; not disastrous but dulling. Mixed metaphor once—“storms of dissonance”—is acceptable. No scaffold sentences or synonym churn beyond that loop, so clarity intact. Final image crisp: “vested hush was his legacy,” a clean staccato close.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe with lyrical beats. Some scaffold present—“emerged transformed always” repeated 5× becomes mantra rather than propulsion; slight loop. Figurative language is coherent (moonstone dust as heartbeat) and supports tone. No mixed metaphors or register drift; clarity remains high, but density of repetition slightly dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often does triple duty (e.g., “swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse” seeds motif, locates shard, launches search). Rhythm breathes—long sentence for waterfall roar, clipped fragments for key discovery. No loops or synonym churn; “broken” recurs with shifting referent (clocks, self, pattern) so counts as purposeful pattern. Metaphors stay coherent (compass as heartbeat) and do not invade causality lines. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dense, efficient lines (“the downpour had scrubbed the soot…”) carry triple duty—mood, setting, causality. Zero paraphrase loops; only a single “she understood” nicks the peak beat, keeping it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean, with high information density—each sentence advances image, action, or metaphysics without scaffold. Occasional near-repetition of “luminous ache” and “hidden sunrise” drifts toward motif-chant but stops short of loop. Metaphors stay concrete and internally coherent; no mixed vehicles or register drift. Final line lands with imagist clarity that re-illuminates earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, deliberate—“grove of towering, glass-barked trees” anchors tone without purple. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds density. Opening and final lines are economical and propulsive. Minor slip: “the mathematics of mercy consumed him” edges toward label-speak, but context keeps it tolerable.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, compressed; only minor loop-risk in repeated “anchors of intuition” phrasing. Figurative language stays tethered to body and object—no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image efficiently. One paraphrase seam: “between childhood and now” appears twice without new inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Scaffold phrasing recurs—“the weightless burden,” “he mended more than elevators”—creating echo loops that dull momentum. Some sentences list micro-actions without pressure: “He packed his tools, the horologist’s mainspring barrel safely in his pocket.” Generally clear, but tightening could cut 10% without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “bottled whisper… glass surface misting over with the chill of contained potential” does world, object, and temperature in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances texture or causality. Metaphors stay coherent (frost = code, books = fruit) and converge on the rupture. Minor register elevation (“luminous moment”) is earned by prior pattern; does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong read-aloud cadence and varied sentence openings, yet a run of participial phrases plus three “burnished” repetitions edges toward template. No mixed metaphors, but slight scaffold in storm descriptions keeps it shy of 7+ polish.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and efficient; concrete nouns (“brass gears,” “crystalline notes”) outnumber modifiers. Occasional stacked soft abstracts (“tinkersong wonder,” “symphony of potential”) flirt with overwriting but never obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; spatial tracking flawless. Final line lands with image, not exposition; earns its uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, zero mixed metaphors. High density: “mechanical groans faded” does scenery, time, and social context in five syllables. Paragraph cuts are surgical—removing any sentence would collapse atmosphere or causality. Final line’s monosyllabic cadence (“collection in itself”) lands the quiet charge cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentences splice sensory data, tool action, and conceptual leap ("she carved not just wood, but the essence of connection"). No synonym loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language scarce in peak beat, maintaining clarity. Varied sentence openings, purposeful paragraph cuts propel momentum without algorithmic feel.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean, loop-free, and image-dense; no scaffolding or synonym churn detected. Metaphors stay coherent—light, glass, bloom form one consistent field. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-echo motif. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing,” “earned stasis”) appears only in rubric language, not in story proper, so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is clean, high-density, no loops or scaffold. Figurative control precise: “obsidian lagoon” and “sheet of black glass” reinforce without contradiction. One near-miss: “searing reverie” appears twice; the repetition is purposeful but edges toward thesis-label, a hairline slip that does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm modulates naturally; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. High density—“paper lanterns, once mere decorations, could be redesigned to harness solar energy by day”—does triple work (image, world-rule, thematic pivot). One paraphrase loop (“false comfort” x2) costs −0.2; otherwise zero scaffold. Final line earns its resonance: “wishes were unnecessary.”

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long incantatory cadences to clipped dread; no scaffold or synonym loops. The single mixed metaphor (“wax curls like pale petals”) is brief and purposeful, not cluttered; information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet clear: “pale and veined with shifting colors” packs visual and tactile data; no synonym loops or scaffold. Metaphors (ice-crack, celestial orbits) stay coherent; final silk/stone image is precise, not purple. Minor repetition of “furiously tranquil” is earned by pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; sentences pull rather than push. High density—each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphor. Minor over-modifying (“profound quiet,” “gentle sound”) but peak beats stay clear. Copy clean.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence variety high; information density strong (“yellow lantern glass, a smooth shard that glowed with soft, inner light” does triple object-work). No mixed metaphors; figurative language is spare, each image re-used (glass glow → star trails → final pool). Minor scaffold: “tracing the path of falling stars” phrase recurs 4×; but it is the story’s drum and pays off in last line, so −0.2 only. Copy clean; no typos or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is spare, rhythmic, and high-density; sentences rarely repeat openings, scaffolding is minimal. Metaphors (ghosts like pale smoke, covenant as tangle) are few, clean, and integrated. No looped phrasing or synonym churn detected; occasional Latinate uplift (“tranquilly perceptive”) reads as conscious stylistic choice rather than register drift. The final paragraph’s triple repetition of “no longer” is deliberate cadence, not artifact, sending the story out on a controlled diminuendo.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: one sentence = garage-sale clue + sensory hit + conceptual tilt. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (time as tapestry, melody). Rhythm modulates: short declaratives for stranger’s arrival, longer lyrical coils for reflection. Minor scaffold: “in the days that followed” is boilerplate transition, but it lands outside climax and does not obscure closure. Keeps 9-band by a hairline; one more mixed metaphor or late filler clause would have clipped it.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and rarely redundant; only occasional soft abstracts (“burnished hush”) flirt with poetic filler. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops obstruct the closing image. A few filter verbs (“he watched,” “he felt”) could be trimmed for immediacy, but they do not dull the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    Almost no scaffold: each sentence adds new physical information or creature reaction. Metaphors are sparse and coherent—“sleeping giants” for pillars, “lattice for potential” for copper—never stacked. One paraphrase risk: “not a cage of confinement, but a lattice for potential” restates negatively then positively, but the second half introduces the key term “potential,” so it earns its keep. Final paragraph avoids sentimental cadence; the single sketch replaces explanatory summary, keeping closure image sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric clauses for procession, then staccato “Then a low hum arose.” No synonym loops; “dusty footprints” recurs with accretive, not repetitive, force. Information density high—each sculpture image also advances argument. Metaphor of “slow-moving stars” for dust motes is singular, not stacked, avoiding purple overload. Closure sentence is lean, letting bronze quiet resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lines are musical, scaffold-free, with varied sentence shapes and strong verbs (“crushed,” “scattered,” “hummed”). Occasional poetic abstractions (“concord felt tangible”) slight loss of sensory edge, but never muddy causality. No loops, no mixed metaphors; information dual-loaded via bird-call soil readings. Final clause concord “melody of balance returned” risks soft abstraction yet lands within lyric contract.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm alternates between long, scent-tracking sentences and staccato phonograph fragments, propelling the ear forward. Figurative density is high—“auditory puzzle encoded in the physical landscape of the groove”—but every metaphor is tied to Baron’s profession, so it reads as perception, not ornament. No scaffold loops; pronouns stay clean. One mixed metaphor: “the hush felt wilder” (hush cannot feel) is a micro-slip that slightly blurs the closure cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet atmospheric; sentences vary in length to mimic temporal stretch without pattern fatigue. No synonym loops or scaffold; information density high—“gilded compass rose applique” does triple duty as heirloom, tactile anchor, and thematic reprise. Peak beat (sensor recalibration) keeps clarity under pressure. Minor elevation: “temporally stretched air seeming to thin” flirts with abstraction but earns lyric effect.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean and propulsive: varied sentence lengths, no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Information density high—chess swap, starlight sliver, celestial maps all packed into two clauses. Read-aloud rhythm breathes at summit, accelerates during beam. Minor template echo—“the sky was wrong / the sky was whole again”—but it’s purposeful reprise, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: three-beat cadence of spelled words (“remember—listen—forgive”) acts as stealth refrain without template monotony. Information density high—each sentence layers marble acoustics, body motion, memory shard. One paraphrase loop: “luminous absence” echoed four times; delete one instance to avoid self-quote. Metaphors stay coherent—penumbra as portable guilt, gallery as archive—no mixed vehicles. Closure line “carrying the small gestures forward” is plain but necessary exhale after lyric climb.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lines multitask: “the stone pulsed with a warm, steady light” simultaneously signals success, elapsed time, and emotional thaw. Metaphors stay coherent—mercury, stone, feather form a tight elemental triad without mixed-vehicle clash. One paraphrase loop (“home was…home was…”) in the final paragraph dulls the cadence slightly. Otherwise, information density is high, propelling rather than stalling the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ivory-weighted fingers now traced invisible patterns on worn coat” does three jobs in twelve words. No scaffold loops; no metaphor pile-ups. Occasional cadence echo (“woven hush…fierce repose”) is pattern-taught early and pays off in the final image. One mixed metaphor slip—“tempest of regret within” beside “woven hush”—costs a hairline notch, leaving the line clean enough for high-band work.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances either atmospheric pressure or thematic weight. Figurative language is patterned—echo, prism, shard—so density reads as design, not purple. No loops or scaffold; near-duplicates (“refract…refraction”) serve thematic emphasis and are taught early. Final paragraph avoids artifact, letting the bell’s clang land clean.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Information-dense lines do double duty: “brass mechanisms whirred and clicked, straining against the acidic vapors” advances atmosphere + stakes. No scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse, taught early (“kintsugi, not for pottery, but for recollections”) and paid off in golden pulse. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses on surface, staccato underwater. Proofing clean; only one minor tense hiccup (“began to narrate, his voice a stream” could tighten). Final line recharges motifs without over-writing.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is natural; sentence variety is good; information density high—each paragraph advances knowledge or image. No synonym loops, no filter-verb stacking. Figurative language is spare and integrated, avoiding purple drift. Micro-redundancy only in “she saw that” clause noted above, a −0.2 artifact that does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, scaffold-free; mixed metaphors absent. Only minor repetition (“scent” 3× in 60 words mid-scene) but each instance adds sensory layer, forgiven. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with mirrored floral image. No loops, no register drift; high information density achieved through verb choice (“refracted,” “imbue,” “bypassing”).

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with storm cycles; sentences shorten as charge builds, lengthen in post-ritual calm. Information density high: one line can layer storm sound, copper smell, and memory of quarantine borders. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Filter-verb use is voice-motivated (“she felt” is rare and earned). Figurative language is sparse, precise: “leaking vessel of unvarnished fact” carries theme and physicality. Closure line is clean, image-driven, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: languid sentences in mist, clipped fragments when memory surfaces. Metaphors are spare and accurate—“opal dock gleaming like a pearl” matches both visual and thematic luster. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or interior tilt. One mixed texture: “insidious as the damp air” momentarily personifies weather without payoff, but the slip is outside closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong density: single sentences fuse sensory report, backstory shard, and foreshadowing (“17th-century atlas exhaling mildewed exile”). Rhythm breathes with scene—long sentences pre-discovery, staccato during squeeze-through crevice. Two micro-loops: “glimmer danced” echoed three times within 60 words; “promise/promise” in opening and closing paragraphs. Mixed-metor hiccup: “archway of light…shifting paths of possibilities” is abstract atop already-ethereal image, clipping 0.2. Otherwise, clean mechanics, vivid verbs, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses motion, sensation, and metaphor (“Clouds swirled below, a sea of white hiding the kingdom she no longer felt part of”). No scaffold loops; each sentence advances. Figurative language is disciplined—only two metaphors per beat, never stacked. Final line propels: “command the silence” is strong verb, no adverbial crutch. Copy-clean; pronouns track despite single gender onstage.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong verbs and sensory nouns propel. A few soft filters—“she realized,” “she felt”—dull immediacy near climax. No loops or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph repeats “density of presence” three times; minor scaffold. Otherwise clean, read-aloud rhythm varied.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or emotional charge. Metaphors stay coherent (mountains as broken teeth, nostalgia as feral predator); no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “I was… I was…” anaphora in dream shard is purposeful, taught early, and paid off. One paraphrase loop (“chaos… chaos”) but it occurs in low-pressure exposition; closure image remains uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: one sentence often sets scene, body, and metaphor (“morning fog clung… trembling calm”). Metaphors are coherent (water, birth, fog) and avoid clutter. No loops or repeated stems; alternating sentence lengths create breath. Final sentence cleanly propels closure; no register drift. Minor filler: “she realized” could be cut, but beat remains immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Density high—most sentences perform double duty (action + atmospheric charge). No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; crystallization metaphor stays internally consistent. One paraphrase tic (“held breath” repeated) but spaced enough to avoid drumbeat. Final image clear, propulsive, unpolluted by artifact. Clean copy—pronouns, tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    Near-identical sentence stems loop paragraph after paragraph, creating scaffolding fatigue. Abstract nouns (“illusions,” “truth,” “unity”) pile up without sensory concrete counter-weight. Mixed metaphors (“universe’s hiccup,” “spiral arbitration”) coexist without coherent physics. The closing glow is a convenient dissolve rather than a crisp image earned by prior detail.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; each repetition is purposeful percussion. Information density is extreme—one sentence can surface time, tool, light, and metaphysics (“He inserted the mantle clock key into a smaller, auxiliary device, adjusting its flow to match his reversed count”). Figurative logic stays coherent: water = flux, gears = division, horizon = illusion. No artifact touches closure; final line breathes.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene pressure—long coils for contemplation, staccato for alarm. No loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and coherent: “quiet wildfire” motif returns only at charged nodes. One mixed metaphor (“tension that belied the serene… landscape”) is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density lines (“probability professor’s daughter, would read its patterns with both rigor and heart”) compress occupation, lineage, method and theme in one breath. Metaphors stay physically coherent (rainwashed stone = “clover melancholy of renewal and decay”) and propel rather than stall. No scaffold loops or synonym churn detected; only a single template cadence near the end (“With each traversal, each interpreted message…”) but it serves as intentional accumulation, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean, imagistic, and mostly propulsive; sentence rhythm modulates with longer lyrical lines then tightens at loop activation. Occasional paraphrase loops (“endings how to begin” echoed) and stacked modifiers (“melodically haunted tone”) flirt with redundancy but stay within tolerance. Concrete nouns dominate; metaphors are fresh (cord as “sleeping serpent”). No grammar stumbles or simultaneity errors; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose breathes with variable sentence lengths, no template cadence; metaphor vehicles (ink drinking memory, jasmine breathing back) remain internally consistent. High density achieved—single sentences fold scent, history, and threat together. No loops or synonym churn; “haunted euphoria” appears once, earned by scene rather than repeated. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-charge motifs, satisfying read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops, high density: “silence and vines conspired” does two jobs (setting + personification). No mixed metaphors; moon-rock as “stolen piece of silence” is precise. Sentence variation supports beat—long loopy lines for speech, staccato when rock changes hands. Final line earns its lyric lift without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence layers sound-touch-grief without paraphrase loops. Metaphors are internally coherent (ultrasonic → dew → chord) and physically plausible. One template cadence: triple “a” anaphora in paragraph 3 (“a flood… a library… It did not…”) but it accelerates the beat and is pattern-taught. Closure line is uncluttered, letting the chord image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes with tension: descriptive lulls contract into staccato “sent it forth” pulses. Information density is high—each sentence layers method, memory, and stakes without scaffold. No mixed metaphors; gravitational “swell” and narrative “unbending” coexist under physics motif. Final clause “forever listening” avoids drumbeat by varying sentence length. Minor loop: “confident uncertainty” phrase reused twice; distance permits −0.2, keeping score above 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet musical: varied sentence lengths, strong verbs, no scaffold loops. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—each metaphor (camera as “vessel of perception”) returns reweighted. No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Opening line anchors stakes; final line releases image without over-explaining. Minor opportunity: one “gleaming like liquid silver” is familiar phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level rhythm breathes with scene pressure; no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but patterned (tapestry-as-map, seedling-as-hope) and stays coherent. One scaffold stem (“volcanic tenderness” ×3) is a minor artifact (−0.2) but does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong rhythmic control—sentence length and cadence literally drum. Occasional stacked modifiers (“auroral sorrow,” “ethereal gold”) flirt with purple but serve sonic texture; pattern taught early and held. One paraphrase loop: “shared dream was not extinguished; it lay dormant” restates prior beat without new pressure. Otherwise high density, no scaffold, no filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lines are lean, rhythmic, dual-duty: “storm-lit darkness” marries atmosphere to obstacle; “whisper can navigate where a shout cannot” compresses theme into propulsion. No filter-verb clusters, no mixed metaphors; only two adjacent sentences begin with “She,” a trivial cadence echo. Read-aloud ear test passes; final paragraph slows into cadence release that mirrors waning storm without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is taut, rhythmic, information-dense; every sentence layers light, water, or emotional valence. Metaphors stay coherent (weaver → Lyra → star map), no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “spiralingly calm” appears four times—acceptable because pattern-taught and closure-charged. Zero paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; sentences breathe with paragraph variation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean, occasionally luxuriant—“mist curled around her like a protective shroud” leans ornamental but fits the spell. No loops or synonym churn; however, several abstract intensifiers (“unspoken astonishment,” “hidden hopes”) substitute for concrete sensation. Information density is moderate; some sentences serve only atmosphere. Final image line is crisp and earns its lift, but earlier lulls keep the score shy of 7-plus excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is taut, rhythmic, and image-dense: “whalebone scrimshaw, carved with the image of a leviathan” packs noun-specificity without modifiers. No filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either tide-level or emotional level. Figurative language is sparse and precise—grace hidden beneath grime, combative tenderness—never crowding a single beat. Final paragraph slows cadence to match surrendered exhale, ear-test passes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies; clauses breathe with the scrape of the knife. Figurative language is sparse and apt (“skeleton of color”). No loops or scaffold, but occasional adjective stacks (“manufactured and deep”) slightly slacken momentum. Clean copy; no artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentences vary in length and syntax. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative layer is dense but patterned, not overwrought. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “aesthetically driven soul”—slightly academic for POV, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn detected. Strong verbs—“molded,” “vibrated,” “wove”—propel without adverbial padding. Metaphors stay physically coherent (glass “ablaze,” reed “tongue”). Opening and closing lines echo musically, earning cadence shift. A single over-written clause “gradients of gray he could only imagine” is forgiven in an 800-word space.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; long breath-blasts simulate resonance, then clipped fragments mark micro-adjustments. No loops or synonym churn; “golden shadows” returns with accruing weight, not padding. One mixed metaphor—“ribbon of color and tone”—survives, but it is brief and early, so closure untouched. High density: each sentence layers sensory data with emotional tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is textured but disciplined: silver petals “fell into gemstone buds” compresses process and metaphor in one clause. No synonym loops, no scaffold. Opening line anchors profession and loss simultaneously; final line returns to star simile with cadence lift. One hairline repetition—“genuinely artificial comfort” and earlier “genuinely artificial symbol”—is intentional thematic reweighting, not churn.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “The measuring tape, coiled beside her, was not for physical dimensions but for gauging the spaces between possibilities.” No paraphrase loops; each recurrence of “reverse engineering / multiplying paths” adds new semantic layer. Figurative coherence is high: ink drinks light, rain merges into path-streams, tape stretches across time—no mixed metaphors. Filter-verb count low; occasional elevated diction (“cultural fingerprint”) fits cartomancer lexicon. Closure line is clean, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Information density high: “twilight deepened into night” compresses time while advancing atmosphere. Two adjacent paraphrase loops—“anguished joy” repeated thrice—ding −0.2 but do not touch closure beat. Metaphors are coherent (pagoda light as “fractured colorful beams”) without mixed logic. No scaffold, loops, or polarity flips in final third; closure image remains crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “a quietly vivid thing, its colors muted…” carries sight, irony, and foreshadow in one stroke. No mixed metaphors; figurative language spikes only at deliberate beats (“silver shroud” mirrors emotional veil). Rhythm modulates—single-sentence paragraph after “she would not attempt to reattach it” gives the refusal a visual beat. One paraphrase loop (“she shed… she shed…”) is pattern-taught and thematic, hence waived.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; high density—“meteor hush” carries triple duty (tone, title, closure). Concrete nouns replace modifiers: “frosted hourglass,” “crystalline shard.” Rhythm accelerates across tunnel descent via short, enjambed clauses. No mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse, taught early, and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear: cadence builds from dust-moted hush to crystalline crescendo without template repetition. Metaphors are sparse, selective, never stacked; “sleeping serpent” appears once and pays off in transferred energy. Information density high—each sentence advances image or stakes; no scaffold or synonym loops. Closure line (“the unused love had a guardian now”) is crisp, propulsive, unadorned.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences perform double duty: “She adjusted the orrery, the remembered stardust within her seemed to awaken” advances plot and reifies metaphor. Rhythm breathes with white-space paragraph breaks that mimic meteor arcs. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice & stakes; final line crystallizes motion-within-rest. Minor risk: “shadowed rapture” could drift toward cliché, but context keeps it fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information density is high: one sentence often fuses body, tool, and concept—“She set the chess clock on the sand, its frozen face a testament to time's standstill.” Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “sparks ignited into steady flames” repeats the fire trope already implied, but it occurs mid-text and never touches closure. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—compressed during diffusions, open at the final silent wind.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent—“waterfall of cascading mercury”—without mixed vehicle crashes. One paraphrase loop: “translocation a probable miracle” repeated near start and end (−0.2). Information density high; sentences twin-job (atmosphere + causality). No scaffold or synonym churn in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.1)
    Rhythm breathes: sentence length modulates with terrain; no template cadence detected. High density—every image does two jobs (mood + foreshadow, e.g., “distant sea” = future shore). Zero paraphrase loops, zero mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors tone and metaphor; final line sonic callback. Clean grammar, precise punctuation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive; every sentence moves from dusting to discovery to implication without scaffold. Figurative language is spare and owned—“seraphically mundane” is coinage justified by monastery tone. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Only tiny lapse: “a promise of safety that had been paid for with truth” is slightly abstract summary amid otherwise concrete ledger evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense but not purple; most figurative language serves double duty (dragons = shelves, night flower = ink). One scaffold trace—two adjacent sentences beginning “His words…” and “Each book…”—is minor. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors; spatial tracking clean. Final third avoids figurative muddle: “graceful collapse like sand through fingers” is concise and tactile. A single paraphrase loop around “patience” could be trimmed, but artifacts do not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, with high information density; each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. Figurative language is spare and accurate—no mixed metaphors. Occasional template cadence (“periodically eternal” repeated) is the only scaffold trace, and it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image. Opening and final lines are sharply anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies: short declaratives for motion, longer hypnotic clauses for the hum’s build. Figurative language is selective—“cocoon of silent thunder”—and stays within physics of the scene. One scaffold pair: “quiet of a universe holding its breath” echoes “thunderous serenity,” but the repetition is thematic, not redundant. No loops or register drift; pronouns clean; opening and final lines anchor voice and reverb.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence lengths vary from pared “She untangled the kite” to sinuous “Back in her makeshift shelter…”. No filter-verb stacks; “she felt” moments are immediately sensory. One paraphrase loop: “whispers of leaves and roots as clear as spoken words” echoes two sentences later—minor −0.2. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve by concrete image, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong information density: one sentence often carries sensory cue, memory shard, and metaphoric echo. No scaffold loops; only minor paraphrase (“salt-scorched earth” / “salt-scorched” two sentences later) costs −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent: graft = healing, lighthouse = indifferent time. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Closure sentence (“she had built a sanctuary…”) is slightly explanatory, but image still lands.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
    <comment>Premise fusion—drone-strike survivor + arboretum horticulture—feels inevitable rather than gimmick: both zones deal with collateral damage and forced regrowth. Grafting as trauma therapy is fresh, not workshop trope. Specificity of junipers flowering in salt wind counters generic PTSD orchard. Risk taken with quiet lyric escalator instead of plot reversal; coherence maintained. No close echoes of famous scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density: “the air hung thick with the dust of neglected knowledge and the salt of the sea” does three jobs in twelve words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stance or image. Metaphors are coherent (kaleidoscope, cartographer) and tied to Elian’s craft. Minor filter-verb cluster mid-story (−0.2) but none in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“frozen waves” of stone, “captured jewel” drone—never crowding crisis beats. Information density is high: ink properties, drone task, time-theory all embedded in action. Opening and final lines are propulsive and echo each other without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: one sentence often does two jobs (“She inserted the letter's data chip, feeling the hum of awakening systems”). Metaphors are spare and coherent—library as circulatory system—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “the quiet growing more dizzying” repeats the opening epithet; since pattern is taught and echoed at closure, penalty is hairline. No loops impair causality or final image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Figurative language is selective—no metaphor pile-ups in peak beats. One paraphrase loop: “weaving continuity through chaos” appears thrice with minimal variation, docking 0.2. Minor scaffold: “the airship scrap…engraved quiet” is repeated almost verbatim within 40 words. Otherwise diction is concrete, props tracked cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths maintain momentum; high density (“vaulted dome… swallowed her solitude whole”). One metaphor string forgiven because pattern taught early (“orbits of regret”). Closing line avoids scaffold, ends on resonant tap. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong rhythm and information density: most sentences layer job, image, and motion (“she began to inscribe patterns into the soundboards, creating constellations of silence”). Mixed-metaphor risk appears only once—“time folded more tightly” beside “bleed like phantom frequencies”—but context keeps it coherent. Opening and closing lines serve as acoustic brackets, satisfying read-aloud ear test. Lacks true 9+ flawlessness because two adjacent lines paraphrase the same emotional beat (“guilt washing over her anew” after “she wept, the guilt washing over her”), a minor loop that dulls the climax half a degree.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is textured but disciplined: “lilac haze that softened edges and bred a deep, pervasive unease” packs scent, vision, and dread into one clause. No scaffold loops; each sentence either advances sand-pattern or acoustic field. Single overripe cluster—“beautiful, chaotic connections they still shared”—is forgivable at climax. Read-aloud rhythm surfs from whisper to hush without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm varies: long sentences for lingering ash-heat, fragments for surge spikes. No synonym churn or template cadence. “Warm coldness” is a deliberate oxymoron taught early; payoff in final line. Information density high—each sentence advances image or interiority. One minor loop: “shattered sky” appears three times within 60 words mid-story; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyric density is high yet patterned; metaphor chains are deliberate rather than churn. First two sentences repeat “closed/awakened” in a mild paraphrase loop (−0.2). Otherwise, propulsion is clean; sentence variety and paragraph cuts tighten to musical beats. No scaffold or simultaneity errors; imagery stays coherent under synesthetic load.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose carries high info density: single sentences layer action, sensory data, and metaphor (“Each sweep of light was a neural pathway made visible”). Figurative language is selective; no sentence-level overcrowding. Rhythm varies: long lyrical clauses build texture, short fragments mark peak beats. Zero paraphrase loops, no template cadence. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge the motif. Minor alliteration (“willowglass hope”) is purposeful, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: single sentences map emotion, tool function, and cave response. Metaphors stay physical and consistent—no mixed vehicles. Clause variation keeps momentum through a 700-word single scene. A lone paraphrase loop (“ancient and new… ancient magic”) costs a sliver. Closure line is crisp, free of ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    High density: “sealed fate,” “tangled knot of inevitability” compress premise and stakes in two phrases. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay consistent (time = amber, prophecy = weave). One paraphrase loop: “unearthed silence” repeated twice without new cargo costs −0.2. Final line lands clean, rhythmically open, recharging “raw possibility” without syntactic flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: one sentence often does two jobs (“The silver hush of the bluff was profound, muffling sound and thought alike”). No synonym loops or template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent; “mist coiling like forgotten secrets” is fresh yet compressed. Occasional elevated diction (“vouchsafe”) fits spy idiolect without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers weather, memory, and metaphor. No loops or scaffold; each repetition (“tick,” “percolate,” “palimpsest”) is pattern-taught and paid off. Metaphors are coherent—river as time, needle as key—without mixed vehicle crashes. One strained uplift: “spindrift serenity” appears five times; while thematic, the cadence borders template, nibbling the 9+ edge.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, high-density; no loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is spare and integrated (“sharp gentleness”) without metaphor pile-ups. Sentence variation supports meditative tempo; opening and closing lines anchor and recharge. Minor opportunities for even crisper verbs, hence not 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary and no scaffold loops stall momentum. Figurative language is selective—“sheet of silver,” “fragile cloak”—and does not clutter the high-pressure mirror beat. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous harbor,” “quivering hush”) fits the lyric register but keeps within Elara’s reflective lexicon. Information density is high: one sentence often layers sensory detail, emotional state, and tool history.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are internally coherent—light held “in a way that defied ordinary physics” is literal diegetic rule, not poetic excess. Sentence cadence varies: fragmentary bursts under hum-stress, then expansive closure line that mirrors tidal rhythm. One near-miss filter stack “she realized that…” is immediately redeemed by embodied follow-through, keeping artifact penalty beneath visibility threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the spiral: clause length contracts toward the center, then expands on exit. No synonym churn; “spiral,” “weave,” “thread” recur with accretive purpose. Mixed-metaphor check clean—spiral as both path and emotional filament stays coherent. One paraphrase loop (“keeper of secrets” twice in three lines) is minor; does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm accelerates with polysyndeton during bypass sequence; no loops or scaffold, only one mixed metaphor (“white noise sea”) that mildly dulls but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean and image-rich; sentences pull double duty (“the blueprint drafting compass point, an ancient tool she believed could map the nexus’s unstable geometry” delivers prop, motive, and world rule). No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Two mixed metaphors (“starlight tasted of cold iron”; “music transfixed the air”) are vivid enough to pass. Opening and closing lines are resonant bookmarks. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she felt… she recalled… she reflected”) in coda dulls momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lean, high-density; few scaffold sentences. One paraphrase loop (“spongey dread… spongey weight”) and a near-filter stack (“she felt the dread intensify”) dull immediacy in precisely the climax beat, blocking 8+ entry. Otherwise strong verb choices, concrete nouns, no mixed metaphors, and punctuation clean.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm modulates like bow strokes—long lyrical sentences breathe, then staccato fragments at the reveal. Figurative language is selective: “bridge-song,” “pixelated amnesty,” each reused with accruing weight rather than sprawl. No mixed metaphors; scaffold-wrap image stays physically coherent. One paraphrase loop (“sculpting possibility from the ashes of never” tripled) deducts 0.4; otherwise density is high and propulsion clean through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies, propulsive without algorithmic drumbeat. Information density high: each sentence advances ritual, setting, or ice mechanics. Mixed-metaphor risk (“froth of petals and decay”) is justified by vortex physics. No paraphrase loops, synonym churn, or scaffold. One tiny hedge—“she began to chant, her voice a steady drum”—could trim “began to,” but artifact does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density: one sentence often performs setting, emotion, and stakes (“Tears mingled with sweat…portal glowed brighter”). Mixed-metaphor risk (“time felt fractured…paths twisted”) is kept in character-thought and recurs, forming teachable pattern, so waived. Paraphrase loops almost absent; one scaffold fragment (“This was her method…”) is strategic telling that compresses backstory effectively. Final line cadence slows, giving closure image breath without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: longer clauses while she kneels, shorter fragments at rustle/keeper entrance. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal grain. Metaphors stay vegetal-bone, coherent within world logic. One register drift—“trammeled the flow of time itself” dips into grandiosity but recovers immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.0)
    Scaffold loops (“after the applause,” “insulating emotionally”) and near-paraphrase stacks dull momentum. Metaphors are safe (“tangible echo,” “ashes of failure”) and occasionally mixed (“echo valley longing”). Information density is moderate; several sentences could be cut without loss. Rhythm is regular to the point of monotony; final line lands cleanly but without sonic snap.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with magnetic pulses; sentence length varies from short gasp to long loop. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; “knowledge fruit seed” is purposely archeological, not accidental thesaurus-itis. Information density high—one line often moves setting, emotion, and analogy. Closure line is clean, imagistic, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; no loops or scaffold detected. Metaphors (moon as forge, water as grammar) stay consistent with the world’s physics. The only minor slip is the stacked abstract nouns in “conceptual repricing” territory—one “wonder” too many—but it occurs after closure and does not dull the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm modulates: shorter beats at hesitation, longer lyric surge at illumination. High density without scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Occasional elevated diction (“iridescent,” “luminous”) is earned by the transcendent moment; no mixed metaphors. Clean comma use; no loops or paraphrase stacks. Final line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences fuse setting, backstory, and emotional charge. No loops or scaffold; “patched bellows” recurs with reweighted meaning, not churn. Metaphors (accordion breathes like river) are consistent with POV expertise. Copy clean: no tense drift, pronoun ambiguity, or anachronism.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.7)
    High information density—each sentence advances decoding or atmosphere. Minor template cadence in “She documented… she documented…” pair (−0.2). Metaphors are sparse and coherent (“mist thickened, pulsating”). No filter-verb stacks or scaffold loops. Final line cadence is satisfying; no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    High-density lines: “starlight swallowed by velvet” does setting, mood, and metaphor in five words. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed-metaphor guard: “mulberry ache” appears twice but recast color-to-sky, so permitted. One scaffold tic: “propagate” used four times in 200 words; however, it is the thematic piston, not synonym churn. Final paragraph breathes, giving cadence payoff without momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe with climbs vs. carves. Three “vineyard hush” repeats and two “scallop” clusters are the only loops; they serve pattern-building but slightly dull propulsion. Metaphors stay coherent (clouds as veil, stone as wave); no mixed vehicles. Information density is high—each sentence advances image or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean, image-dense, free of scaffold; only two adjectives per noun, strong verbs (“unhook,” “drape,” “fray”). No mixed metaphors; hollow mirror logic remains coherent. One template loop: “the wind…” opens three sentences in close succession—minor, does not touch closure. Final line cadence mirrors chime scatter, ear-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene: long sentence for drift, staccato for panic. No synonym loops; “grotto”/“platform”/“pond” reused exactly. Metaphor stream is dense but patterned (stone→rings→self) and paid off; no mixed vehicles. Zero scaffolding; every paragraph advances knowledge or image.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong rhythmic control mirrors escalating resonance; sentences lengthen then compress at the humming climax. One scaffold loop—“centuries of layered dust” repeated with near-identical phrasing—dulls momentum slightly. Metaphors (towers as instruments) stay coherent; no mixed vehicles intrude on closure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong ear; sentence variety good; no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor over-writing in stacked modifiers (“brilliant dimness… perpetual ice… soft, enduring light”) but pattern is taught early and thematically motivated, so no deduction. Information density high; transit compressed efficiently. Closure line clean.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: each sentence layers job-detail, atmosphere, and foreshadowing (“their ascent painted the air with a meteor hush”). Figurative language is sparse, precise; no mixed metaphors. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes image. Tense stable; no typos. Prop tracking clean—key tag, orb, rowboat all handled on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong nouns/verbs, minimal scaffolding; occasional modifier stacks (“golden haze,” “cosmic silence”) verge on purple but stay coherent. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Minor paraphrase loops (“distill the essence,” “distill wisdom”) in closing third; not severe enough to dull final image. Read-aloud rhythm mostly varied.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is organic: sentence lengths modulate from 28-word lyrical sweep to 7-word heartbeat. No scaffold loops; each clause adds either tactile data or emotional charge. Mixed metaphors avoided—“sea monsters seemed less like threats and more like guardians” keeps vehicle consistent. One hairline slip: “crystallization solidified” is noun/verb tautology, but it lands in mid-section, not closure beat, so deduction minor.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “sapphire viaduct arched over empty river” does world, beauty, and ecological crisis in eight words. Metaphors kept sparse, mixed only when payoff justifies (“thread of logic in tapestry of magic”). Rhythm varies: participial openers rare, strong verbs dominate. One micro-loop: “He worked steadily, his mind clear, his purpose singular” is scaffold; doesn’t recur in climax so keeps sub-9. No typos, tense clean, pronoun track perfect. Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lean, information-dense, and largely free of scaffold; sentences advance image or motive. Occasional soft filters (“He felt a profound satisfaction”) could be trimmed, but immediacy returns with concrete beats (“He laid out the photographs on a blanket and began to speak”). No mixed metaphors or algorithmic cadence detected. Final line offers an ear-pleasing echo of mirrored hush that recharges earlier motif without overt repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences to staccato flame beats; only minor scaffold (“the hidden waterfall whispered…/the orchard stood silent…”) repeats subject-opening, but density remains high and no mixed metaphors mar the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: “parachute buckle she had repurposed from an old emergency kit” simultaneously backstories, characterizes, and props the next beat. Varied sentence rhythm; no template cadence. Mixed-metaphor vigilance avoided—metaphors are tethered to arbor or tech domain. Minor scaffold: “soundless echo” phrase repeated four times; still serves accumulative pattern so penalty minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, motive, or world rule. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“numbness a fortress”—never stacked. High information density: one sentence can anchor setting, reveal history-rewrite, and foreshadow ritual mechanics. Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line resolves with image that recharges “spark” motif. No line-level artifacts touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    High information density: single sentences multitask atmosphere, interiority, plot. No loops or scaffold; “storm-born silence” repeated twice with purpose. Metaphors clean (“canvas for her ideas”). Final paragraph compresses days of labor into three lines—strategic telling that propels rather than stalls. Ear-test rhythm natural; paragraph lengths varied.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances sonic density or body-state. Mixed metaphors avoided: “macerate” stays culinary-acoustic, never veers to muddle. High information density—one line can pulse cord, signal cost, tilt blower. Rhythm modulates from long breathy lullaby phrases to staccato yanks without drumbeat monotony. Closure line (“a lullaby for the living”) lands with crystallized cadence, recharging prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and openers; repetition is purposeful (anaphora) not template cadence. No mixed metaphors; “interiorized the exteriors” is own coined phrase, consistent. High density: each sentence layers cold/mist/light. Minor loop: “the guardian interiorized…” appears twice with near-identical phrasing; costs −0.2 but does not touch closure beat. Final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm: paragraph lengths swell then contract to match the crucible’s inhale/exhale. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal increment. Metaphors are spare—coals “pulsed,” fragments “hung suspended”—avoiding purple overload. Opening and closing lines book-end with “twilight” and “darkness,” creating sonic brackets without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level density is high: each sentence layers sensory, technical, and emotional work without scaffolding. Metaphors are internally consistent—silence as canvas, gorge as cradle—never mixed. No paraphrase loops; the repeated “serenely electric” is the single visible pattern, and it is paid off in closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the tuning action; final sentence lands on monosyllabic cadence that mirrors the single clear tone she hears.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; no filler verbs, no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“time felt like a river flowing in every direction” is the single simile, earned. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for starlight catalog, staccato for radio exchanges. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, satisfying ear-test.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence variety is strong; openings rotate between participial, clausal, and noun-first to avoid drumbeat. Metaphors are mostly coherent, but “forest of shifting trees” is mixed (forest = memories = trees?) and slightly dilutes clarity in a high-pressure beat, a −0.2 artifact. No synonym loops or scaffold; information density is high. Final line anchors with echo of “unsettling calm,” creating resonant cadence. One typo-risk moment: “memories around her began to alter” could read smoother as “memories within her,” but meaning remains recoverable.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences do twin duty (exposition + atmosphere). No scaffold loops; "anchor" repeats only when thematic weight accrues. Mixed-metaphor risk—"tapestry of stars" beside "rust flakes in coral veins"—but coral reappears later, knitting pattern. Minor over-modification: "low, resonant energy" could lose one adjective. Final sentence cadence lands with satisfying thud, no drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose breathes with scene tempo: long sentences for descent, clipped fragments for crisis. Mixed metaphors avoided; “walls rippled like water” is clean. One paraphrase loop: “the crashing hush… filled every corridor—a silence so profound it felt like noise” restates the same idea. Information density is high; sentences perform dual work (setting + interiority). No grammar slips; pronoun trail clean.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and varied: sentences open with changing structures, paragraphs breathe. Figurative language is selective (“ink…shimmering” mirrors opal dome) and does not overcrowd peak beats. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; “opal” and “snow” recur only when recharging image. One mixed metaphor—“internal fires reflecting clarity”—is minor, does not touch closure, so stays above 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences float during levitation, staccato during confessions. Information density high—one line can layer scent, stake, and tool state. Only minor scaffold: “the metamorphose began” slightly outlines what image already shows. No mixed metaphors or template cadence; final line earns its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean: no loops, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and functional (“arches spanning… like frozen music”). Information density is high—each sentence advances image or tactic. Occasional adjectival stacking (“tarnished wonder,” “nascent hope”) flirts with template cadence but never clots the beat. Closure image remains luminous and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clear and mostly concise; a few template stems (“he checked… he stepped… he watched”) create faint cadence loops. Figurative language is restrained, averting purple overload, but also misses texture: “brittle hush” is repeated without deepening. No scaffolding paralyses closure; final image is uncluttered, yet rhythm stays flat rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is compressed and rhythmic, high information density; sentences vary in length to echo quiet vs. release. Only minor scaffold: “misting hush” repeated twice without new charge, −0.2. No metaphor clashes, no filter-verb stacks. Read-aloud ear test passes. Final line lands on image that recharges wind-bell motif.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-zero scaffolding; every sentence advances image or motion; figurative density is high but coherent (hyperbolic light, silent sonnets) and peaks only after pattern is taught; no mixed metaphors or synonym loops; final line lands with crystalline brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive: “streaks of gold and violet swirled” carries motion and color in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds temporal or sensory newness. Mixed metaphors avoided—light as pigment, dream as mist—both sustained. Filter verbs minimal; when used (“she saw the cipher resolve”) they serve the camera metaphor, not detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe with the twilight-to-star cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned (starlight as key, silence that screams) and stays coherent. Minor loop: “improbable longing” is used three times without new inflection. No scaffolding or synonym churn; each sentence adds image or motion. Clean grammar and unambiguous pronouns; only nit is a slight simultaneity in “he inserted… and the world began to warp” which reads fine metaphorically.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    High-density lines: “glass panels fractured and veiled in algae, ringed by the skeletal hulls” (setting + decay + circle motif). Varied sentence openers; no template cadence. Metaphors consistent—cosmic/sea never clash. One paraphrase loop spotted (“broken constellations” ×3) but serves pattern, not slack. Final image clean. No artifact touches closure. Could trim adjectives (“crisp nostalgia”) to ascend further.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously: “shard-mirror archivist moved…” Each sentence advances either tactile setting or emotional pressure. Metaphors stay physical—shadow as memory slice, leaves as gate—never mixed. Only minor thud in “combat tenderness” coinage, not enough to dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors waterfall surge—long fluid clauses for mist, staccato beats for seed burial. Mixed metaphors avoided; “net of pure intention” is single extended vehicle. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances either color loss or color return. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she felt… she felt…”) in the ethereal crossing trims the final tenth.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and concise, but repetitive scaffold (“she… she… she” openings, “rain-scoured fresco vault” echoed four times) and stacked –ly modifiers (“methodically curious,” “shielded openness”) create mild loop artifacts that dull the closure line. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is mostly clean, high-density, with selective metaphors (“shelves stood like skeletons”). A few template cadence runs—“She… She… As she…”—appear mid-page, not in closure beat, causing minor drag. No mixed metaphors or purple overwrite; sentences advance at least two jobs (image + interiority). Final paragraph trims to crystalline image, satisfying read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies: long breathless clauses build pigment layers; short fragments mark lightning flashes. Information density strong—each sentence layers image, tool function, and emotional charge. No mixed metaphors; “tendrils of code” extends natural metaphor consistently. Minor scaffold: “Between lightning and thunder” repeated four times; because it is pattern-taught and serves as drumbeat mantra, deduction waived under artistic license.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary in length; strong verbs (“pattering,” “pierced,” “shuddered”) propel. Occasional modifier stacks (“warmly inquisitive anticipation”) flirt with overwrite but sparse enough to avoid artifact. No loops or paraphrase scars. Punctuation clean; opening and closing images echo neatly. One mixed metaphor (“needle of frost and silence”) barely dents clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.9)
    Metaphor density is high—nearly every sentence—creating a lullaby cadence that fits the drift but dulls urgency; mixed strands (thread/bobbin + library + dusty starlight) coexist without contradiction yet accrue slight fog. Template stem “He [verb]” repeats across consecutive sentences, dampening propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean, readable, and free of loops or mixed metaphor. Occasional filler creeps in (“felt both grand and lonely,” “mesmerizing prelude”) that could be cut without loss. No artifact touches the closure beat; momentum remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, no loops or synonym churn; strong verbs (“crunching,” “hummed,” “burst”) keep momentum. Figurative density peaks at the light release but stays tethered to mirror mechanics, avoiding purple fog. One mixed metaphor—“soft hush of the distant morning” layers auditory onto temporal, mildly muddling sensory logic. Paragraph breath matches scene rhythm: short climbs, open white space for revelation, longer reflective close.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. High information density: single sentences fold setting, emotion, and stakes (“Their hope was a brambled thing…”). One paraphrase loop (“the words were simple, yet strangely trustworthy… trustworthy” in adjacent clauses) clipped −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Prose propels without scaffold; final line is image-driven, not explained.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“pane of hush” recurs with accrued weight), never obscuring the gear mechanics. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into monosyllables at the toll, then snaps to silence—precise line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. High density: “shimmered with malevolent light” does visual + moral work. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors clean. One paraphrase loop: “graceless beauty” repeated twice within 40 words—minor. Closing line “silent guardian in a world of graceless beauty” lands with cadence lift; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    High informational density: each sentence advances image, metaphor, and causality. Metaphors (foam as unity, chrysalis as release) stay coherent; no mixed vehicles or synonym loops. Clean grammar and strong verbs throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud ear is strong: internal rhyme and varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat. Metaphor density is high but coherent under the light/void motif; only one mixed image (“glimmering parole” as both release and blade) grazes overlap. Information density is excellent—every sentence carries image + concept + micro-action. A few scaffold phrases (“She quantified the absence of…”) repeat in the final third, clipping momentum, but they do not obscure the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid monotony. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, metaphorical, and emotional work (“tasted a memory of lost love, its flavor both sharp and sweet, like unripe fruit”). Mixed metaphors are controlled; “sturdy brittle” is intentionally oxymoratic, not incoherent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; occasional adjective stacking (“coral icebound pavilion”) reads as deliberate lyric compression rather than overwriting. Closure image (“hint of forgiveness, like a delicate spice”) lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; metaphor density stays moderate. No loops or template beats, yet occasional scaffold (“the weight is not just metal…”) explains what image already shows. Opening and closing lines are competent, not electric.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong density—each sentence carries mirror, light, memory, and body—but two adjacent “chaotically precise” phrases create synonym churn. One mixed metaphor (“spiraling coils that loop back”) momentarily violates physical logic. Otherwise propulsive, with vivid nouns and muscular verbs; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence variety strong; read-aloud cadence breathes with beats. Figurative language is dense but patterned to grotto optics, avoiding mixed metaphors. High information density: one sentence often layers motion, setting cue, and interior stance. One scaffold repeat: “she had to... she had to...” (two beats) survives because it encodes escalating urgency; no loop elsewhere. No artifact in final third; closure image stays sharp. Minor trim opportunity in “forgotten combinations hide” echo, yet propulsive overall.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence either advances the crack-reading or prepares the resonant cavity. Figurative language is sparse, never stacked, and the final strum is rendered with monosyllabic clarity that lets the imagined sound ring.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments during surge. Figurative language is sparse and organic (“light seem to bend”). No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold—the phrase “correlate the scattered signs and portents” repeats conceptually soon after—barely dulls momentum. Otherwise information density is high and sentences pull double duty.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and openers. Figurative language is selective—only four metaphors in 800 words—and none clash. Information density is solid: each paragraph advances image or action. However, repeated abstract nouns (“silence,” “empathy,” “fulfillment”) accumulate without texture, and the final paragraph stacks four “silence of X” fragments, creating template cadence that dulls the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes: long sensory sentences alternate with staccato scent notations. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances scent knowledge or emotional stance. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“wildflower hush” is the only compressed metaphor, paid off in final line. Filter verbs minimal and justified; “she realized” appears once at epiphany but is immediately anchored to embodied exhalation.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, largely free of loops; only minor scaffold (“the world flipped… Then, the world flipped” echo). Metaphors stay physical and coherent; no mixed vehicles. Density is good: one sentence often layers sensory cue + world rule + emotional filter. Tense stable, paragraph cuts tight. Final image (“guided by water and wonder”) risks slight sentimental lift but is earned by prior water navigation motif.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety strong; no template cadence runs. Concrete nouns predominate—“rust-streaked walls,” “shred of plastic.” One paraphrase loop: “silence…smothering…silence” in para 1 & 17; minor. Figurative language sparse and accurate; no mixed metaphors. Clean grammar, clear prop tracking; high information density with momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary in length and texture, propel forward, and carry double duty (image + motion). Occasional poetic stack (“breath-taking tapestry of emotions and hues”) edges toward purple but occurs post-climax where breathing space is allowed; no loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often sets mood, anchors body, advances action. No scaffold loops; metaphors are clean and non-contradictory. Occasional elevated diction (“otherwhere”) is motivated by world-walking awe. Clarity at closure is pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, no loops or synonym churn; figurative language disciplined to two per sentence max. Filter verbs minimal; sensory detail woven through motion. Register stable, no corporate drift. Minor scaffold: “the pendant… the pendant… the pendant” anaphora in final third; artifact touches closure, caps 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with discovery—long sentences for layering visions, staccato for the blow. No loops; each frost image adds new information. Figurative control: “crystalline structures rose like trees” is the only simile, earned by setting. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly; final line resolves by image (“she had found what she sought”) without canned uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong noun-verb propulsion: “hammered cold iron,” “coaxed resilience.” No filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops; each sentence advances state or image. Metaphors stay physically coherent—arches “hum” as sympathetic resonance, not cartoon. Minor filler slips: “quietly determined” repeats twice; “rubble” over-leans. Final line is crisp, recharging “hammered on” as existential pulse. Clean copy: no tense drift, homophone error, or spatial glitch.</answer>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
    <comment>Fantasy trope—humble craftsman granted arcane knowledge—is refreshed by planetary orchard-gravity geology and community-share conclusion. Silk-for-knowledge barter reverses the usual gold economy; blade-as-symbol not weapon sidesteps militarism. Floating stone arches, whisper-tree mage grove feel particular rather than generic, though “orchard planet” flirts with exotic placeholder. Risk is moderate—no structural experiment—but synthesis stays coherent and avoids cosplay vibe.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with stair-climb labor and dawn surge; no template cadence. Sentences carry double duty: “The lantern room at the summit was said to be haunted, not by ghosts of men, but by the lingering echoes of drowned sailors’ hopes” seeds theme and stakes. One paraphrase loop—“cold… chill… cold”—in lantern paragraph; minor. Closing line lands with crisp image, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong nouns/verbs, high density; most sentences twin-load image + motion. Mixed metaphors (“lighthouse heart,” “laughing storm herald”) mildly jar. One paraphrase loop (“ancient shadows…ancient shadows”) and a filter-verb cluster dull immediacy in the climax beat, barring 9+ clearance.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm modulates from languid valley sentences to sharp prismatic fragments, mirroring light refraction. Occasional modifier stacks (“valley-mist wonder that blurred the lines”) flirt with overwriting but serve atmospheric density. No loops or synonym churn; information is layered. One mixed metaphor (“stories like iron to lodestone” beside “moths to flame”) slightly blurs vehicle coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, with high information density—each sentence layers image, tool, and emotional state. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally. Occasional elevated lyricism (“fragments of light, hidden truths”) borders on pattern without payoff, but it never muddies causality. Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; paragraph cuts are purposeful, advancing from storm to tower to dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes: long sentences for sustain, fragments for flickers. Figurative layering is dense (“tapestry of light and time,” “web of belonging”) yet stays legible under the Accumulative mode—each metaphor is a thread literally thickening. No mixed vehicles or template cadence; however, near-paraphrase appears (“world slowly succumbing to a pervasive, silent chill” echoes “realm’s vitality was fading”). Information density is high; most sentences do double duty. A tightening pass could trim 2–3 adjectives (“vibrant color,” “gentle, perpetual glow”) to earn 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Varied sentence openings; no template cadence detected. Information density high: one sentence often fuses sensory detail, backstory, and emotional charge (“Its ovens gone cold without fanfare” packs economic loss and personal grief). Metaphors are spare and coherent—“archaeological love” is apt to digging and history. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Micro-movements (“shifted a section of the fountain’s base”) are purposeful, not puppet joints. Copy-clean: pronoun clarity perfect across “she/her” and “his” journal. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene temperature. One tiny filter verb (“she noticed”) could be trimmed, but immediacy remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with scene temperature: measured clauses during sampling, staccato noun phrases at each fade. No loops or synonym churn; “gently meticulous” is repeated twice but serves as mantra, not artifact. Metaphor vehicles stay consistent (light = memory, ice = silence). One mixed metaphor—“quartz hush”/“crystalline stillness”—but it is taught early and paid off, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean and image-dense: “the gentle lapping of water and the soft glow of lanterns masking the danger” layers sight and sound in one stroke. Figurative language is spare; when used (“trust breaking…like ice on a winter branch”) it is anchored in Elara’s rural sensorium. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stealth, time, or atmosphere. One micro-redundancy—“the comforting unease of the scene wrapped around her” appears twice in variant forms—dings perfection but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense: “fragrant blanket over the bluff” does double duty (smell + tactility). No scaffold loops; each sentence advances position, texture, or knowledge. Metaphors stay coherent—ozone taste, compass pulse—without mixed-vehicle clutter. Opening and final lines are ear-tested and cadence-matched. Minor: “weather-worn face” is a stock phrase, but it occupies only two words and does not recur.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong propulsion: “She fled… she descended… she lifted…” keeps momentum. Metaphors stay coherent—crystals fracture light / fractured confidence. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds texture or action. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the auroral motif. Minor: “inaudible callings” is an adjective stack that could compress, but it does not fog causality.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentence for archive voices, staccato on return. No template cadence or synonym loops. One mixed metaphor risk—“archive choked with rusted sorting machines”—but “choked” is physically apt for air-starved dome, so forgiven. Final line packs three jobs: sky image, leaf glow, mission redefined.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is musical, dense with percussive consonants that mimic bell resonance; clauses are layered but uncluttered, achieving high information-to-word ratio. Occasional lyrical generics (“ethereal hue,” “world’s soul”) flirt with abstraction, yet they feel genre-appropriate rather than scaffold. No loops, paraphrase stacks, or mixed metaphors; temporal sequence stays clear. Final paragraph repeats “glisten/ring” in a deliberate crescendo that earns its echo, keeping closure image sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; sentences perform dual duty (“The fire was hot and clean, carving a precise exit…”). Metaphors are coherent—dome breath, living skin, mosaic wholeness—each re-prices at closure. High-density packing without scaffolding: every clause advances image, choice, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean, high-density; nearly every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; “lavender clinging to its silver” is precise and fresh. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. Final paragraph’s cadence shift—short sentences mirroring release—earns stylistic payoff without overwriting. A single adverbial clause “much like the locked mailbox” edges toward explicit analogy, the only hairline slip preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence decodes setting, stakes, and motion simultaneously. No loops or scaffold; “hangman’s dice clattered” is repeated only when their state changes. Metaphors stay coherent (web, pirouette, cipher) and converge on closure. One tiny register drift: “conceptual repricing” tone in “encrypted her own vulnerability” could be more embodied (−0.1).

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: one sentence often paints atmosphere and advances action (“gravity pooled… lanterns swing in erratic arcs”). Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“gleaming silence” recurs with shifting emotional valence). Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, no scaffold; every paragraph changes knowledge, intention, or emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic, yet synonym churn (“quiet brook’s flow,” “gentle flow,” “flow of energy”) and stacked modifiers (“terrestrially cosmic energies”) create scaffolding. Dense metaphor every sentence blurs physical logic—how does paper glow brighter?—but clarity survives. Closure line is clean, permitting mid-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is highly controlled: metaphor vehicles stay physical (wax, iron, jasmine) and never collide; no mixed-metaphor muddle. Density is high—each sentence does two jobs (atmosphere + character or causality). Two adjacent “I”-openings could have been varied, but the pattern is brief and does not stall propulsion. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; closing sentence lands with imagistic snap.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and causal work (“the shell’s whisper grew into a clear, haunting voice”). No loops or synonym churn; “velvet” recurs but re-accruing texture, not padding. Metaphors stay coherent (radiant sorrow). Final beat avoids overwriting; silence itself completes rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong imagistic density, but repeated abstract nouns (“pearlescent light,” “twilight sky,” “twilight faded”) create near-synonym loops that dull precision. Several sentences open with “As…” or “She…” in runs, producing template cadence. No grammatical errors; pacing breathes with emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm modulates to mimic canyon delay—long sentences swell, then fragmentary echoes. Information density high; each line advances mood or mythic pattern. Occasional stacked epithets ("serpentine nexus under starlight") flirt with purple, but compression outweighs. No paraphrase loops; opening and closing lines anchor voice and resonance cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm is deliberate and tidal; only two adjacent paraphrase loops (“he traveled… he entered the sleep”) create minor scaffold. Figurative density is high yet coherent—starlight, glacier, globe motifs interlock without mixed-metaphor bleed. Information density strong: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and mythic registers. No line-level artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lyrical yet lean; figurative language is patterned (moon paths, knots, lattice) and pays off at closure. Occasional elevated diction (“scintillatingly somber”) risks register drift but reads as Kaelen’s idiom. No loops, no scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: many sentences do double duty (“radioactive dust that glowed faintly under a bruised sky” sets scene + foreshadows storm stilling). Varied syntax; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent (diamond flaws as energetic map). No scaffold or paraphrase loops; minor participle openers but actions remain sequential. Ear test reads clean aloud.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm is deliberate, oceanic—paragraph swells mirror cloud-storms, then tighten on mud and crowd. Figurative layer is thick yet purposive; mixed-metaphor risk is low because vehicles (glass, crackle, storm) share an atmospheric physics. One paraphrase loop at coda noted in Q2; otherwise information density stays high. Filter verbs rare; verbs are strong: “she dissolved the last barriers,” “sky washed clean.”

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong auditory and tactile specificity (“frail, halting tune,” “glass cool against calloused fingers”) and high information density—most sentences layer action, image, and emotional charge. Occasional overwriting: two adjacent “old regrets and older hopes” + “positively wistful” repeat the same emotional abstract; “lonesome splendor” appears three times with diminishing returns, creating synonym churn. No mixed metaphors, but template cadence in “He… then he…” runs across three sentences in the capture sequence. These loops stay clear of the closure beat, so momentum survives but 9-band is disallowed.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—long sentences for sunset sweep, staccato for crunch-steps. Information density strong: one sentence often fuses sensory cue, tool state, and emotional valence. Minor loop: “the key grew warmer, its resonance seeking harmony” duplicates prior sense; one mixed metaphor “sunset bled gold into violet” is passably picturesque but not muddled. Closure beat is clean, earns its hush.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no drumbeat pattern. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—only two metaphors in climax zone, both legible. High information density: “lodestone device on the viaduct, its needle quivering toward a specific point” does triple duty (tool, setting, tension). One paraphrase loop: “to sculpt patience from the impatience that had once ruled her” vs. “she had sculpted patience from impatience” occurs 40 words apart—minor. No mixed metaphors or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is lean and propulsive, sentences vary, no scaffold loops; however, several near-metaphor clashes (“ghostly heartbeat,” “tapestry of resilience”) stack in climactic paragraph, risking fleeting coherence. Filter verbs minimal; strong nouns/verbs dominate. Opening anchors tone and place efficiently; final line offers charged image. Minor overwriting in “entangled memories intensified” abstracts what lantern glow already shows. Copy is clean; no typos or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors the meticulous task: longer clauses for reflection, staccato fragments when gears click. High density—each sentence advances image or moral stakes. One mixed metaphor (“dust motes danced…like shards of hope”) is forgiven because it is immediately grounded in the light that ignites the brass. No loops, no scaffold, clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density—each sentence layers action, image, and concept. Occasional scaffold phrases (“a constant reminder of the world’s relentless decay”) and one mixed-metaphor hiccup (“acid sea…spat”) slightly dull the closure image. Overall read-aloud ear is good; minor tightenings would lift to top band.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: one sentence often does archival, emotional, and plot work—“the deleted entries were its unmarked tombs” layers metaphor and stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay consistent. Opening line anchors voice and concept simultaneously. Minor register lift in “existential silence” is earned by prior accumulation of ghost imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; each sentence advances image or causality. Only minor loop: “shadow-laced” appears three times in first 150 words without new inflection. Metaphors stay coherent (ice groans, mirrors pool time). No filter-verb clusters or register drift. Final paragraph could lose one adjective (“soft light”) without loss, but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence variety supports the breath of waiting. Occasional filter stacks (“she realized,” “she wondered”) dilute immediacy but never cluster in peak beats. No mixed metaphors or loops; information density is high and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph lengths swell for lyric accumulation then contract at closure. Figurative runs (“passionate subtlety,” “burning quietly, eternally”) verge on purple but support accretive texture. Minor scaffold: “he saw… he realized…” template repeats three times, dulling edge. No mixed metaphors in peak beat; closure image is clean. Read-aloud flow strong despite ornamental surplus.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly loop-free; only minor paraphrase pairs (“whisperfield calm…fading echoes of wisdom”) appear. Metaphors stay consistent (echo, resonance, stone serpent) without self-contradiction. No scaffold sentences or template cadence detected. Opening and final lines anchor and echo effectively. High-density lines carry simultaneous world-data and emotional charge, sustaining momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies well; sentence openings rotate. Occasional soft fillers—“she chose to linger here,” “in that moment, everything made sense”—slow propulsion without breaking it. No mixed metaphors or over-modification. Scaffold is minimal; only minor paraphrase loops near the reflective coda.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from short pulses (“Light flooded the room”) to sinuous accumulations without algorithmic pattern. Figurative language is sparse and purposive—“silver blur,” “radiant burst”—never clogging the high-stakes beat. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors; the leaf-sound motif threads cleanly from setup to payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm varies naturally; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density high—single sentences layer action, memory, scent. Metaphors (vinyl = reunification) stay consistent and physically rooted. Opening and closing lines are sharp, book-ending the arc. One tiny scaffold: “the scent of hope…seemed to grow stronger” uses seemed where direct perception would be stronger; not enough to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “residual energy from the Great Warping” compresses backstory in four words. Metaphors are sparse and coherent; no mixed vehicles clutter the high-pressure ritual beat. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for archive work, staccato clauses for key-turn and blood-drop—without algorithmic pattern. One paraphrase loop (“quietly deliberate” appears four times) is the only minor artifact, but it never obscures causality or dulls the closure shimmer.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but avoids purple overload; metaphors are consistent (constellation, bone, garden). One paraphrase loop—“a shrine to her misplaced trust… the cleft in her certainty had widened into a chasm”—drops it from 8.0. Sentence rhythm varies; no filter-verb stacks. Closing line lands cleanly without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is rhythmic, textured, and propulsive: "serpentine grotto," "persistent, serpentine mist" uses repetition to teach pattern, paid off in "zephyr bloom." No synonym loops; each descriptor adds new angle (mist as listener, shroud, canvas). Figurative language peaks only after polishing beat, not during. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density: “honeyed hush” and “cathedral of green” compress tone + setting + stakes in four syllables. No loops or scaffold; figurative language disciplined—one metaphor per beat, none in closure sentence. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) stays within narrator’s conceptual lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is lush but loops: “swirling hush,” “whisper of closing pages,” and “against the current” recur with near-identical phrasing, creating template cadence that dulls peak beats. Mixed metaphors appear (“repository of countless hopes” vs. “tapestry of human longing”) without charge. Sentence density is high, yet some sentences duplicate prior content (“She solemnized this hope…”). Clean grammar and strong verbs keep it above 6.0, but the ornamental repetition blocks 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence can layer sensory cue, metaphor, and causal push—“the vine tendril stretched toward the sky, as if pulling down the moon’s benevolent energy.” No scaffold loops; paragraph cuts pass. Metaphors stay internally consistent (tapestry → golden threads → woven stories). Read-aloud rhythm modulates without template cadence. Minor purple flecks (“verdant arbor”) are genre-consistent and do not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    Highly tactile, image-driven sentences carry double duty (atmosphere + causality). Rhythm breathes with ritual pacing; no template cadence or synonym loops. One mixed-image risk—“moving stillness”—is deliberately oxymororic and pays off at closure, so exempt. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “she began/she lit” could compress, but propulsion is intact. Closure line is crisp and resonant. Within hair of 9.0; no artifact touches the sealing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean-lyric: “no tick, but a resonant hum” packs three sensory channels in six words.  One paraphrase loop—“stored wonder… buried marvels… wonder could be saved”—repeats concept without fresh angle, clipping the top band; otherwise density is high and figurative logic stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythm control: paragraph breath-pauses align with ritual beats; sentence openings vary. Occasional micro-loop—“weight of… weight of…” in adjacent burdens—dulls momentum. Mixed metaphors (“shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie”) stay coherent within lyric license. Information density is high; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences layer weather, tool, emotion. No paraphrase loops; each repetition (“here and gone,” “crystallized time”) accrues new nuance. Metaphors are concrete—“rust-hued peace” anchors color to decay. Final third clean; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: single sentences deliver setting, stake, and metaphor (“carousel had halted, its once-gyrating lights now dimmed”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors consistent (time = river, not mixed). Sentence rhythm varies: short beat “She waded” vs. cumulative list of story fragments. Minor scaffold: “Eroded ambitions” repeated 3×; does not obscure closure. Copy clean; no typos or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; high information density—each sentence advances setting or motive. Minor scaffold: “redirected flows” concept is stated repeatedly without new angle; “maze of intentions” echoed four times, thinning impact. No contradictory metaphors or register drift. Clean grammar, precise spatial tracking, zero paraphrase loops in closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm succeeds: sentence length modulates like a musical phrase, climaxing in the soft tick at the end. No scaffold or paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“glacial hush,” “spectral echo”—never piled into purple. Opening and closing lines are crisp, anchoring voice and resonance without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong ear for cadence; sentence lengths wax and wane to mirror twilight hush. Some paraphrase loops—“architecture of lies / salvage the past / training instincts”—repeat across adjacent sentences, padding density. Metaphors are spare and coherent; no mixed vehicles. Tense stable; no scaffolding artifacts in closure beat. Opening and final lines are sharply anchored. Minor synonym churn keeps this shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “snow,” “salt,” “fish” hit salty consonants; fog “swallowed sounds and shapes” compacts two senses into one verb. No synonym loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Metaphors (lightning-born glass, thread of life) recur with purpose, not clutter. The final line’s “silent promise of the weavers” lands with echoic clarity, satisfying read-aloud ear.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong information density: one sentence often does description + stakes (“egg felt bitterly sweet, a symbol…”). Rhythm varies across paragraph lengths; no template cadence runs. One mixed metaphor—“quaking reverie”—is purposeful and paid off. Zero loops or scaffold; closing line is image-driven, not explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses: sibilant sand, dental stops in “drilled and strung,” open vowels of the song. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances tool, body, or atmosphere. Metaphor count stays just under the density ceiling; one more stacked image in the graft paragraph would have triggered −0.3. Line-level control supports closure without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is strong; sentences vary and propel. A few scaffold phrases (“the box was heavy… the box felt light”) and stacked metaphors (“mind a prism,” “city sighed”) slightly dull immediacy. No loops touch the closure beat, so the prose stays above the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but disciplined; metaphor strings serve the cosmic lyric mode without cluttering causality. No loops or paraphrase. Sentence variety is good, though occasional stacked adjectives (“soft glow of nascent nebulae”) flirt with density. Peak beat—“the quiet sigh of falling petals”—is crystalline, earning its poetic license.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Syntactic variety supports thundering calm: long anaphoric cadence for migration swarms, then curt recitative for poem snippets. Information density high—one line can layer glass crack sound, ribbon hue, and memory name. Figurative control consistent (migration as ink, ribbons as roots) without mixed metaphors. Minor micro-scaffold: “she retraced… she retraced” stem appears twice; paraphrase loop but does not touch closure. Opening line grabs voice and quest; final line image resolves pattern cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses with the clock’s cadence; sentence length mirrors pendulum arcs. Information density is high—“tidal obsidian ridge” collapses geology, color and menace into three syllables. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb clutter. A single paraphrase loop—“incremental absolution” repeated three times—blunts the peak beat by −0.2, otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence rises and falls with investigative tension. Metaphors (“velveteen gloom,” “uncharted echoes”) recur purposefully, avoid purple density. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; information per sentence is high. Line “Some endings are just doors waiting to be opened” lands aphoristic but is Mr. Hemlock’s quoted voice, justified. Closure sentence keeps propulsion, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies intelligently; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density high—each sentence advances image, motive, or model. Figurative language (kingfisher diving, cracks on ice) is purposeful, not decorative, and stays coherent. Minor scaffold: “the constraint was…” sentence repeats thematic noun yet serves as hinge, so penalty capped at ‑0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences perform copyist’s meticulous tempo. High density: “cloak of song lyrics” does triple work (metaphor, plot device, theme). No loops or scaffold; metaphor strings purposeful. One mixed image—“thistled calm” (thistles prickle, calm soothes)—but does not obscure closure. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm: long sentence for rocking cadence, then fragment “She worked quickly” to mirror pestle strokes. No synonym churn; “dust,” “powder,” “ash” each get distinct jobs. Single paraphrase loop—“the somber marvel”—is deliberate motif, not artifact. Closure line “silence felt like a beginning” lands clean, no lexical illusion.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty—scraping action teaches world rule while revealing emotional thrust. No paraphrase loops; metaphor is sparse and precise (“mind a whirlpool”). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. One near-miss: “weight of that struggle in her bones” borders cliché, but immediate sensory follow-up (“grinding pressure”) rescues it. Clean grammar, no scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, read-aloud musical, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is dense—nearly every sentence carries metaphor—but pattern is taught early (“subtracting noise”) and paid off in final chord, so density feels intentional rather than purple. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. Minor paraphrase echo: “travelled stillness” and “quiet earned” are near-restatements, but separation allows pass.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, loop-free, high density; no scaffold or synonym churn. Occasional soft fillers—“the city lay silent and dark” opens with familiar palette; “wonder felt fragile, like a dream” is stock simile. Peak beat at summit avoids overwritten figurative pile-up, maintaining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, layered, and loop-free; opening anchors voice and stakes in two lines. Metaphors stay coherent (“pink snow” fits cherry petals). No scaffold or synonym churn; sentence openings vary. Information density is high—each sentence advances image or knowledge. Rhythm modulates with the hush beat, giving natural propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lyrical but disciplined: sentences vary in length, no filter-verb stacks, metaphors stay physical (“waves against the shore”). Occasional template cadence—“cascading revelations” x3—slips toward mantra. No mixed metaphors or loops in the closure beat; momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—e.g., “She adjusted her approach, her daring balanced by the rigid logic of theorems and lemmas” advances plot, character, theme. Occasional template echo: “every step was a variable, every landing a constant” is allowed as pattern-teaching parallelism. Metaphors stay coherent (staircase as formula, die as entropy). No loops, no scaffold, final third clean—only a hairline slip of elevated register in “conceptual repricing” keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences carry double duty—image plus thematic weight—with strong noun-verb propulsion. Figurative layering is dense, yet patterned early (“moon-tipped brush,” “saffron quiet”) so it reads as taught motif rather than purple overwrite. Minor paraphrase loops inside contiguous beats (“visions… daydreams… memories”) and one filter-verb cluster near the climax prevent a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, motive, or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“monument to failure” compresses emotional state without purple drift. Opening and final lines re-anchor voice and re-charge motif. High information density with varied sentence rhythm; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from languid tidal description to staccato clock-spin cacophony, tracking tension. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“latent radiance pulsed like a slow heartbeat”—and never clusters. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each paragraph advances image or causality. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve via concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (“paint peeling like sunburnt skin”) are brief, visceral, never stacked. One mixed register slip—“manufactured light” feels slightly academic for POV—minor, outside closure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image with cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates from languid maritime cadence to staccato strike sequence; sentence openings vary. Information-dense: single sentence can sketch silence, cue tool, and launch fractal. No mixed metaphors—wave harmonized, not “defeated.” Two minor paraphrase loops (“ever-evolving lattice of harmony” adjacent to “complex…lattice”) but not in closure beat; −0.2. Line-level artifacts do not obscure causality or final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; information density high (“histories written in calcium and time”). Metaphors stay physical and coherent—shell as map, crack as syntax. Rhythm accelerates into the whistle beat, then cools with the exhaled air. No figurative muddle under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences layer decay, stake, and historical analogy. Figurative language is controlled—“green shroud,” “stubborn bloom”—no mixed metaphors. No loops or template cadence; paragraph cuts clean. Final line lands with thorn/image payoff. Minor scaffold: “her work had brought her here” could compress, but momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: each sentence layers smell, texture, and concept (“carved wood of her antique ink stamp, a tool she used to mark verified passages”). Metaphors are spare and coherent (“dappled resolve like light filtering through deep water”). Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9+ consideration; earlier “reclaimed stillness” repetition is thematic pattern, not mechanical loop.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sense, tool, and emotion: “She rubbed the gem with a soft cloth, its surface swirling with captured nightmares and joys.” No synonym churn or paraphrase loops; metaphors stay consistent to light/refraction motif. One mixed image—“hollow ache that nothing could fill”—is minor. Final paragraph cadence slows to match release, ear-test excellent. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; information density is high yet clear. Figurative language is spare, purposeful: “ghost haunting a machine,” “bloom of fire.” No overwriting in peak blackout beat—language turns blunt and declarative to mirror the unfiltered knowing. Final line lands with imagistic snap and echoes opening silence.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, with only two paraphrase loops (“missing pieces” echoed four times) and one mixed metaphor (“brilliant dimness”) that still functions as oxymoron rather than clutter. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence detected. Information density is adequate—each sentence advances data or sky image. Line-level artifacts never touch the closure beat, so the piece stays above the 7.0 cap for high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    High-density lines do triple duty: “the cacophony of the city died, leaving only the whisper of wind and water” advances setting, stakes, and metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Filter verbs are rare and voice-motivated. Final paragraph cadence slows to match exhausted acceptance. Opening and closing lines frame and recharge the color motif.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose breathes with variable rhythm; sentences open with changing shapes; no loops or filter stacks; figurative phrases (“mist clinging like a shroud,” “furrowed hush”) are sparse, pattern-taught, paid off in final soft wind. No artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: single sentences layer sensory data, memory spike, and decision. No paraphrase loops; “merrily melancholic” functions as intentional motif, not artifact. Metaphors sparse and clean; mixed vehicle avoided. Rhythm modulates with swell and ebb of waves, accelerating paddle strokes mirrored in shorter clauses. Closure image—“he was home”—clear, uncluttered, resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence length varies with footing on stone path. Occasional loft—“ethereal light,” “fluid maze”—but metaphor domain coherent. No loops or scaffold; information density high. One mixed moment: “delicately robust” is reused rather than re-imaged, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: one line often fuses scent, emotion, and world-rule (“cardamom… piercing the veil between worlds”). Figurative language is patterned from first paragraph—moonlight, spice, breath—so late metaphors feel earned, not sprawl. No mixed metaphors; “scent of memory will guide you home” is literalized when aroma becomes bridge. Sentence rhythm varies: long breathy accumulations for spell, clipped fragments for bodily dissolution. Copy-clean; no typos, near-duplicates, or scaffold loops. Final line opens with quiet coordinating conjunction, mirroring eternal continuation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Mixed metaphors avoided—vehicles stay airborne/cloud-based. One scaffold: “She unfastened… unfastening…” repetition could compress. No filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops in peak beats; closure image stays crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is almost loop-free; only minor scaffolding (“a single, unwavering truth,” “her existence was defined by”) could be trimmed. Metaphors stay coherent—light as thread, stone as lens, ship as womb—and never collide. Rhythm breathes: long sentences for ritual, fragments for crackle. Information density is high; each sentence at least doubles duty (atmosphere + motive, or sensory + thematic). Closure lines are uncluttered, letting the image detonate. A lone paraphrase loop near start (“patchwork tomb of forgotten human ambition”) repeats tomb notion already implied; −0.2 keeps this just sub-exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is fluid and rhythmic; sentences lengthen and contract with scene breathing. A faint loop—“She… and walked” / “She walked on”—appears in closing cadence; not scaffold-heavy but enough to nick 0.2. Metaphors (morning-dew wealth, cosmic dance) are familiar yet cleanly handled; no mixed vehicles intrude on the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Information density high—“she aligned the quill holder with the shadow” performs three jobs: action, cipher, image. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“cradle of sparks” recurs without muddle). Minor scaffold: “the fort remained dark” restates prior blackout; not clustered in closure, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: short percussive sentences during rock placement, lengthened reflection after beam hits. Information density high—“collapsed star dust sealed in leadwood box” packs world rule, object, and ritual stake into eight words. One mixed metaphor only: “visions twisted like eels in a net” is accepted as character-specific. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cut test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentences vary. Occasional stacked metaphors (“cartography of scars,” “stormlit silence”) flirt with density but pattern is taught early and returned at end, so forgiven. Minor paraphrase loop: “vigil was in pause” repeated 3x; could trim 1. No synonym churn or filter-verb stacks. Closure image clean. Solid line-craft with room for tighter pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety high; no template cadence or synonym loops. Mixed metaphors avoided—mechanical arm whirs like “scorpion’s tail” once, then discarded. Information density strong: one sentence can place needle, reveal hour-line, emit click, slide compartment. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line (“questions of yesterday now charting a course for tomorrow”) recharges brook-metaphor without cliché. Zero scaffold; paragraph cut test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, read-aloud rhythmic, with purposeful paragraph variation; redundancy is minimal. Metaphors (“skeletal frame,” “luminous fracture”) are coherent, though “luminous fracture” is repeated without fresh re-weighting, causing minor cadence staleness. No mixed metaphors or algorithmic sentence patterns; verbs stay strong. Minor loop: “luminous” appears four times across 700+ words—just under the density penalty threshold, but noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is propulsive and information-dense: “the projector whirred to life, casting stark, silver images onto a sheer curtain of mist” performs three jobs—action, sensory texture, and spatial anchor. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Metaphors are coherent: “tidal arbor above the clouds” keeps sea-rhythm consistent. Minor lyrical overgrowth—“aching melody swallowed by vastness”—is pattern-taught early and paid off, so allowed. Final line lands on image, not exposition, recharging the broken clock motif.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence length varies, paragraphs breathe. Information density dips in two spots where abstract summary replaces scenework (“She interpreted these visions…”). One paraphrase loop (“luminous doubt” ×3) and a minor scaffold (“the knowledge fruit seed had served its purpose”) dull momentum mildly, but artifacts never obscure causality or final image. Metaphors remain coherent, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally: short imagist bursts (“The rain had just ceased”) lengthen into tidal clauses that mirror ebbing regret. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; each sentence advances either atmospheric pressure or interior shift. Metaphors are coherent—compass needle as memory diviner, lace as relational fabric—and never mixed within single beats. The only minor scaffold is the repeated “tides of remembrance” phrasing, but it is purposeful motif-reinforcement, not unconscious loop.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“Dr. Aris Thorne stood…”, “Her eyes fell…”, “She observed…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in one high-pressure beat (“a silent testament to nature's indiscriminate power”)—slightly generic—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; information density is high without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lyrical but over-compressed: adjacent lines repeat concepts (“retraced her steps mentally… retraced the events,” “patterns in the frost… patterns remained in her mind”). Figurative density peaks in the final third with mixed vehicles (“scorched testament” as paper and resolve; “drifting resonance” as sound and hope), slightly muddling clarity. Sentence openings vary adequately, but template cadence appears in three consecutive “She...” constructions near climax. No fatal artifacts, but scaffold phrasing (“steadily adaptive, she decided…”) reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but purposeful; figurative language serves accumulation (“silence fell like a permanent shroud,” “ripple of gold”). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“scarlet for fear, azure for sorrow, emerald for hope”) edges toward cataloging, slightly diluting momentum. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence beautifully resolves the textural build. One paraphrase echo (“rectify the emptiness” / “rectify her past failure”) costs 0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “water pressing in like a thick, dark quilt” conveys texture, pressure, and emotion. Varied syntax supports propulsion, though two adjacent lines (“He placed… Research revealed…”) slightly paraphrase setup. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; metaphors cohere (light/water/silence motif). Final paragraph’s “key… turned” risks slight abstraction, but “true stillness reigned” earns resonance through prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“clutched,” “huddled,” “infusing”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “amplified quiet of their defiance” risks abstraction; “tapestry of trust” borders on cliché. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent lines summarize impact (“Anonymous donations had sustained... but this declaration would nourish...”) where scene could show. Closure image remains clear despite slight lyric inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled; figurative language appears frequently yet coherently (breath as tide, love as spiderwebs), avoiding muddle. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional beats, and information density is high—e.g., “foggy lucidity where every detail felt both hazy and intensely clear” conveys state, setting, and theme. Minor overwriting in climax (“shower of gentle sparks that rose into the twilight”) borders on purple but serves tone. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; all lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image remains sharp despite lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, mirroring tension (longer coils during visions, shorter cuts during action). However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“drowning in yesterday’s echoes” / “prison of shadows”; “fading photographs… dissolving” / “slipping grip on reality”), creating minor redundancy loops. Figurative language is rich but coherent—no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence risks slight over-polish (“ever-unfolding now,” “infinite loom”), but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is often overwritten: “staggering grace” appears four times with diminishing impact, and phrases like “dust and despair,” “forgotten dreams,” and “living tapestry” verge on cliché. Adjacent sentences repeat concepts (“her chains clinking softly… chains on her ankles loosen”), creating paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high but inconsistent—some images resonate (ghostly banners), others feel decorative (piano bench as “monument to cleverness”). Final paragraph suffers from stacked abstractions that dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Strong verbs (“waded,” “imprint,” “crumbling”) and specific nouns (“ashen forge,” “knee-deep water”) avoid fluff. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“aurora brightened, its colors screaming in her ears—a cacophony of blues and golds”) edges toward purple but remains legible. No loops or scaffolding; rhythm varies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (moonbeams “coil like smoke,” station “breathes”), though “luminous disbelief” recurs slightly near closure. Minor scaffold in “she had done it; she had stolen…” could tighten. Otherwise, rhythm propels, diction stays within POV lexicon, and closure image (“night held its breath”) lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: sentences advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously (“her breath misting in the frigid air” establishes body, setting, and emotional state). Figurative language is controlled—ice/thaw motif recurs without overuse. Minor scaffold detected: “thoughtfully spirited sigh” and “weighty lightness” flirt with abstract labeling. No loops or momentum drag, but one near-paraphrase: “slow unfreezing of emotions” followed by “thaw within her” slightly dilutes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative (“skeletal structure open to the night,” “sibilant urgings coil in his mind”), with strong verbs and specific nouns. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “cacophony of phobias,” “ethereal voice merging with his thoughts” risk figurative density without payoff. No paraphrase loops, but one near-redundancy: “trembling certainty” appears twice. Final lines avoid scaffold, yet the phrase “forever changed” flirts with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: “ambered hush,” “marbled hush,” “storm-tossed ridge fort” repeat with slight variation, risking synonym churn. Sentences often stack figurative phrases (“palpable calm, a canvas for her work”), slightly dulling propulsion. Yet information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme—and the final paragraph’s rhythm resolves cleanly. No loops or scaffolding, but minor density bloat in mid-section prevents top-tier clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density (“optical sensors scanned the icy expanse” conveys setting, character, and function). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One paraphrase-loop risk: “fragmented experiences… disparate selves… fragments of being” edges toward synonym churn, but not severe enough to obscure closure. Figurative language is consistent (ice = fragility, light = knowledge), though “burning curiosity” slightly clashes with metallic embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lyrical yet precise, with varied syntax and strong verbs (“thaw mistrust,” “woven a deeper bond”). Figurative language is controlled—“resonant hush,” “spirits lifting as if a burden had vanished”—and avoids purple excess. Minor redundancy in “after words became unnecessary” appearing twice slightly dulls momentum, but not enough to obscure closure. Final paragraph’s cadence resonates without scaffold, though “ambiguously clear” edges toward label-use in repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing and paraphrase loops: “mended deception” appears six times, “blooming withering” five, often in near-identical constructions. Sentences frequently restate the same idea (“polish, commemoration,” “cracked yet shining,” “effort over arbitrary fortune”) without added pressure. Figurative language is dense but coherent; however, the final third is cluttered with scaffold (“her motivation was now a proven fact… the collection remained… each crack represented…”), dulling the closure beat. Information density is low due to conceptual redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density: each image serves atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“The xenobiology research station hung…”, “Kael, the station’s obliging sky mechanic, moved…”, “He entered the observation deck…”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“elegant, light-based equations,” “subtle, visual revelation”), slightly softening immediacy. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; rhythm breathes with the scene’s emotional cadence. Final paragraph’s lyricism earns its weight through accumulated specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “chest-high water,” “unstruck chords,” “slack and wood swollen” do triple duty. Rhythm varies effectively, though occasional stacked modifiers (“dark, stagnant surface”) flirt with overwriting. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; closure beat (“The in between spaces had spoken, and she had listened”) resonates without artifact. One near-redundancy: “flickering lanterns” repeated within close proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose—nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “auroral sorrow” recurs with slight redundancy, and “swaying certainties” borders on label-speak. No paraphrase loops, but one near-duplicate concept (“blurred lines between data and intuition” / “blurred lines between art and science”) dilutes propulsion slightly. Otherwise, syntax varies, rhythm breathes, and closure line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful: “drowsy alertness,” “frail beam,” “profound hush” all do double duty in atmosphere and character. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with tension. One near-loop: “the weight was no longer swallowed; it was simply part of the history” risks paraphrase, but the conceptual shift justifies it. No scaffold, no purple prose—every line propels.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“tunnel of whispered light,” “symphony of quiet endings”) and high information density. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with mood, and rhythm breathes with the narrative arc. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“descent through layers of memory and possibility” borders on abstraction), and slight synonym churn in describing decay (“crumbling,” “dissolve,” “withering”) edges redundancy. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines near the climax restate the keeper’s perception of transformation without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“beneath the hush of dreaming roots” appears four times) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “nurture lifelong wonder” restated verbatim). Figurative language is consistent but overused in high-pressure beats, creating density without propulsion. The final third relies on summary (“Leo carried that day with him…”) rather than dramatization, dulling closure impact. Sentence variety is adequate, yet cadence becomes templated during thematic refrains.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (“half-burned diaries, their pages brittle as autumn leaves”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“bronze quiet” recurs) and payoff-earned (tapestry glows, dragons stir). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“cosmological shift that had altered reality itself”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure beat (“walls spoke on, forever”) is clean, resonant, and artifact-free. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.9)
    Severe paraphrase loops: “orchestrated... by directing the flow” repeats verbatim four times; “transpose... into a new key” appears three times with minor variation. Template cadence dominates: “She had orchestrated...”, “They orchestrated...”, “They continued orchestrating...” creates drumbeat monotony. Figurative language is dense but muddled (“beacon guards what the tide conceals” never clarifies what is concealed). Closure beat is dulled by redundant phrasing (“shared mystery,” “collaborative light,” “brighter future”) that obscures emotional precision.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “decorated the chamber with silence” conveys action, atmosphere, and character). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “unraveled stillness” repeats four times, verging on paraphrase-loop. Figurative coherence holds—blue as concept, sound as weapon—but “muffled clarity” borders on mixed metaphor. No syntactic monotony; rhythm varies effectively. Closure image remains sharp despite slight redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“prismatic shards,” “upturned hush,” “invisible storm”—but avoids purple overload by tethering metaphors to action (e.g., lake cracks add bass notes). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence, and information density is high (each line advances character, setting, or theme). Minor flaw: slight figurative repetition (“symphony” variants appear 7 times), but no loops, scaffold, or muddled vehicles. Closure image (“nautilus segment lay beside her”) lands with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “walls shifting and bridges forming in response to the runes he deciphered”). Sentence variety supports rhythm, and figurative language is mostly coherent. Minor artifact: “procedural generation” feels slightly expository and clashes with the mythic tone; also, two adjacent lines restate timeline fractures (“fractured timelines… echoes of moments that never were”). These don’t obscure closure but prevent 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“drums humming in sympathy” merges setting and emotion). Figurative language is consistent (music as “tapestry of silence”), though “metallic flower” verges on mixed metaphor. No paraphrase loops; syntax varies purposefully. Deduction for one scaffold phrase: “audibly muted performance was not empty but full” slightly tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally vivid but suffers from recurring phrasing: “layered tranquility” appears three times with minimal variation, creating a paraphrase loop. “Progressing laterally” is used formulaically rather than demonstrated. Figurative language is restrained, but “pulse still quick” and “dusk-to-night transition mirroring their journey” edge toward cliché. Sentence openings vary adequately, yet the final paragraph’s cadence flattens momentum with summary (“In the following days…”).

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled—figurative language (e.g., “cathedral of glass and ghostly leaves”) appears selectively, not densely. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional beats. Minor overwriting in “fragile beauty and lingering sorrow” (redundant modifiers), and “fingertips of the soul” borders on mixed metaphor. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure beat remains clear despite lyrical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“its twisted form a question mark in the dim light”) and varied syntax. Figurative language is consistent—fabric, weave, texture motifs never contradict. One paraphrase loop: “uncovering layers” appears twice in close proximity. Final paragraph avoids scaffold, landing on resonant image. Deduct 0.4 for slight overwriting in “passionate subtlety” beat—elevated diction borders on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is evocative with strong information density—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Rhythm supports emotional arc, and paragraph cuts serve visual pacing. However, adjacent sentences occasionally paraphrase (“The chronic hush remained... now it was a backdrop”; “unbinding the echoes was not about recreating... but about finding”) creating minor loop artifacts. Figurative language is consistent but dense in final third—“beacon of magnificent simplicity,” “harmonious incompletion”—bordering on elevated diction that slightly distances immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-embellished: “danced like silent patrons,” “subsume the artificial boundaries” verge on purple. A paraphrase loop appears: “as the transformation completed” opens two separate paragraphs verbatim—a scaffold artifact that dulls momentum. Sentence openings vary well, and information density is high, yet figurative density peaks in the climax without pattern payoff. Final paragraph recovers with concrete action (petal crumbles), salvaging closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.1)
    Repetitive phrasing (“cycles of compassion,” “breezy library under the stars”) creates paraphrase loops across paragraphs. Overuse of abstract nouns (“compassion,” “recognition,” “legacy”) replaces concrete action in key beats. Final third leans on declarative summary (“strengthening the community’s fabric”) rather than dramatized image. Sentence variety exists, but momentum sags in reflective passages lacking micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs (“weaving,” “glimmering,” “chimed”) and controlled figurative language. Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. Minor overwriting appears in the closing paragraph (“illuminated by the luminescent ache that had once been a solitary burden but was now a shared light”)—a slight paraphrase loop between “ache” and “light.” No scaffold, simultaneity errors, or filter-verb stacks; momentum holds despite lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (time as taffy, canals as fate-threads) and peaks without muddle. Minor redundancy appears in closure (“peace in her heart” / “found peace”), but no loops or scaffold dull momentum. Final line’s echo of the opening (“echoes were born”) is earned lyricism, not template.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional beats—e.g., staccato during the vision of Lyra. Minor flaw: slight overuse of “dovetail” (three times) borders on repetitive stem, though contextually justified. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent (e.g., “roots twisted like ancient scripts”). Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with summary (“he understood…”) but recovers in closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly precise, with strong sentence variation and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “sapphire hush” repeats four times, approaching motif fatigue; “kindly methodical” is stated thrice without evolving embodiment. No paraphrase loops, but slight scaffold in “He had... He had...” constructions. Closure beat remains clear despite these micro-artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“emerald carpet,” “intricate map of veins”) and avoids scaffold loops. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“reluctant metamorphosis… grinding shift”) slightly dulls propulsion. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. One paraphrase loop (“reconstruct her approach… reconstruct not by forcing”) warrants small deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “boots squelching in the mud,” “haggard awe,” “fragile balance” do triple duty (image, emotion, theme). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. One paraphrase loop: “transform the ache of loss into something tangible and enduring” / “thresh meaning from experience” echo closely. Figurative language is consistent (water as ghost/guide), but “painted ephemeral paths” slightly strains logic—rain doesn’t paint. Still, momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but controlled; sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. High information density: “crystals sang louder, composing a spontaneous, joyful symphony” merges action, sound, and emotion. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“shimmering downpour,” “gentle, guiding spirits”) edges toward purple prose, slightly dulling immediacy. No loops or scaffold; closure image remains clear despite figurative layering.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is evocative with strong sentence variation and purposeful rhythm, but minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “dripping with the recent rain,” “dust motes dancing in the light” verge on decorative. No paraphrase loops, but “fragments into meaning” recurs as near-synonym churn. Final paragraph’s “promise” resolution is clean, yet “sealed their renewed bond” edges toward abstraction. Momentum remains intact, but density occasionally sacrifices propulsion for texture.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“cracks pulse with intention,” “whispers solidified into crystalline structures”—but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“cascade of revelations,” “starlit clarity”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “phantom punch” verges on repetitive. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with scene rhythm. Final line resonates, recharging the motif of light without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely vivid and purposeful, with strong sensory verbs (“salt-laced wind,” “tile gleamed brightly”). However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “weaving those memories into a tangible form, sculpting space for reflection” repeats the core idea. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph (“The migration would return, and so would the chance to reflect, again and again”), risking lyrical redundancy. No mixed metaphors, but figurative density in peak beats (“symphony of whales and memories”) slightly blurs causality without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“silent origami,” “hushed thunder”) is consistent and payoff-earned. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“kaleidoscope of broken geometries,” “sickly light”) slightly muddles clarity but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Final line crystallizes tone and theme without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “deathly vitality” does atmospheric, thematic, and character work in three words. Sentence openings vary (“Leo dusted…”, “He was…”, “On the stainless steel table…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “equations of justice and mercy unfolded” risks abstraction, but it’s immediately grounded by “sudden clarity.” No loops or scaffold; every line propels story, character, or tone. Final line (“air tasted of possibility”) earns its lyricism through prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Rhythm varies skillfully, and figurative language (“blooming labyrinth,” “symphony of light and sound”) serves thematic cohesion without muddle. Minor overwriting in “tapestry of invented histories” edges toward abstraction, but it’s brief. No loops, scaffold, or register drift—though “refract time itself into its component layers” slightly strains physics, it’s consistent with the story’s internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“a silhouette against the corrugated steel, defined only by his absence from records”) and avoids scaffold or loops. Figurative language is controlled—“palimpsest of a life,” “sea’s inhale and exhale”—without muddle. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the climax (“the layers snapped into place”), which borders on summary, though immediately grounded by sensory recall. Rhythm varies effectively, and every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths modulate breath. However, subtle paraphrase loops appear (“retold her journey… retold how she had traveled”), and “gloomy cheerfulness” recurs like a refrain without deepening, risking scaffold. Figurative language is consistent but borders on saturation in peak beats—sea glass, whispers, echoes—without muddle, yet density slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “mosaic of lashed-together platforms” conveys history and fragility in five words. Sentence openings vary (“The raft city…”, “Elara…”, “Her task…”), and paragraph cuts align with emotional beats. One paraphrase loop: “hopeful desperation” appears twice with minimal variation. Figurative language is purposeful (“shadows long and imposing”), but “deceptive backdrop” leans cliché. Closure image remains vivid despite minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “chemical vials glowed softly… a countdown to an inevitable end”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor redundancy in “purposefully curious” phrasing and two adjacent “she thought… she felt” constructions trigger a −0.3 loop penalty. No scaffold or figurative muddle obscures closure, but not flawlessly lean enough for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lyrical yet precise, with strong verbs (“stilled,” “twitching,” “clung”) and varied syntax. Information density is high—each sentence advances character, plot, or atmosphere. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “magnetic calm… drew even the scattered dust motes into a harmonious dance” risks purple prose. Also, two adjacent lines restate success (“felt the success in the air… saw the success in the way the world felt right”), triggering a minor paraphrase-loop penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (hydrographic metaphors for thought) and paid off (condensation → tributaries → fissure). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“world's primordial pulse”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports rhythm—fragments for tension, complex syntax for reflection. Final paragraph’s fresh condensation pattern elegantly signals ongoing mystery without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-figurative (“dust devils danced,” “fabric of reality”), risking density in high-pressure beats. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph lengths modulate rhythm effectively. However, slight synonym churn (“revival,” “rebuilding,” “restoration”) and passive constructions (“was his sole purpose”) dilute propulsion. Closure image remains clear despite minor ornamental phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most lines multitask (e.g., “gears grate and then shift” conveys sound, resistance, progress). Minor overwriting in “ephemeral, a phenomenon known as the gathered hush”—slightly redundant. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “lonesome splendor” recurs thrice without evolution. Closure beat (“He had become his own rescue”) avoids artifact, landing cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “damp salt air,” “copperlight repose,” and “hover of wardens” do triple duty (atmosphere, character, theme). Minor overwriting in “tapestry of distrust” and “labyrinth of lies” risks purple prose, but most figurative language serves causality (e.g., lattice shadows dancing as pathfinders). No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors earned calm without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot simultaneously. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, recurring phrases like “resonant awakenings” and “lovingly venomous” verge on label-looping, and the climax leans on abstract terms (“mournful elation,” “charged poise”) over concrete sensation. No fatal artifacts, but these minor redundancies and abstractions prevent 9+ line-level mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats (“shimmering lines in the air,” “deep, resonant awakening”)—figurative language borders on decorative without altering causality. No loops or scaffolding, but two adjacent sentences near the climax restate the plate’s glow, slightly dulling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in mid-text (“piecing together a prayer,” “living tapestry”), but figurative language coheres. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively. One slight redundancy: “interrupted journeys” recurs as label rather than evolving image, but closure redeems it through action. Final paragraph’s cadence lands with earned resonance, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished but suffers from repetitive conceptual phrasing: “juxtapose” appears four times, “margins” five, “codes” six—creating synonym churn. Figurative density is high (“corridor of gold,” “ephemeral marks”), but some metaphors blur (“futuristic nostalgia for a time she had never known”). Minor scaffold loops exist (“she checked… she reviewed… she verified”). Final paragraph avoids artifacts, yet mid-story has slight overwriting that dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, varying sentence length to mirror needlework pace. High information density: “skittered,” “dancing shadows,” “phantom sounds” all advance atmosphere and plot. One paraphrase loop: “whispers of truth with the loud lies” / “unravel the conspiracies” slightly redundant. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; closure line (“darkness that was louder than any scream”) is resonant without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “singing spirits wove melodies through aerial roots” merges setting/action. Figurative language is pattern-taught (water/letters/shard as fluid motifs) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “dirge of fierce tenderness”—slightly redundant—but quickly offset by concrete beats (“condensation formed, beading into messages”). Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“twilight space where the glass ceiling held the evening’s bruised purple light”), but rhythm varies effectively. Minor redundancy in “unknotting… thread by psychic thread” and “grafting new meaning onto old wounds” slightly dulls propulsion. No loops or scaffold; high information density. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves cleanly, though “lotus-hearted ache” appears twice, verging on motif repetition without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information yield per line (“fog... swallowed sound and sight, leaving only a muted, gray world”). Minor overwriting in “exposed film” metaphor slightly strains coherence, but rhythm varies purposefully—short sentences for action, lyrical flow for projection. No loops or scaffold; closure image (“light play over the fresco fragment”) is sharp, not dulled.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “methodically playful rhythm,” “floral echoes pulsing with light,” “web of sound” all advance atmosphere and theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, slight overwriting in mid-section (“bewitching melody deepened… consciousness stirring”) edges toward purple prose. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines repeat “awakening” conceptually. Closure beat remains clear and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “vines twisted into unnatural shapes, and time seemed to stutter like a broken record” conveys setting, stakes, and distortion in one image. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths shift with tension. A slight overwriting tendency appears in peak beats (“cacophony of resistance,” “living shadows”), but no loops or scaffold. Final line lands cleanly, echoing the gourd motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.7)
    Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn plague the text: “ensconce,” “shyly unstoppable,” “blossom armistice,” and “off-key wind” repeat verbatim or near-verbatim across adjacent paragraphs, creating scaffold fatigue. Figurative density overwhelms propulsion—most sentences layer metaphors without grounding in action (“echoes pooled like liquid silence,” “reef-shadow joy”). Final third suffers register drift into pseudo-scientific lyricism (“photosynthesize pain”), dulling emotional clarity. These artifacts obscure causality and weaken closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“sea of frozen milk,” “cascade of notes that seemed to weep”) is consistent and unstrained. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent lines describing the song’s echo, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter exist. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and the final paragraph’s cadence perfectly echoes the story’s melancholic resolve. One near-redundancy (“gently systematic” used twice) prevents a 9.0+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with strong verbs (“uns n arl,” “pulsed,” “swelled”) and varied syntax. Information density is high: each sentence advances character, stakes, or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language (e.g., “sanctuary and prison”) is coherent. Slight overwriting in “cautious exuberance” (used twice) and “symphonies of truth” (repeated without evolution) nudges score down—minor redundancy in peak beats prevents 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “dappled resolve,” “slyly heartfelt,” “engineered grace” do triple duty (character, theme, atmosphere). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths mirror breath rhythms. Minor overwriting in “encrypted compassion from the past, meant only for someone who would look closely enough”—slightly abstract for peak-beat—but quickly grounded in scraping residue. No loops or scaffold; every image serves pressure or closure. Final line (“harmony won”) resonates without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally precise and rhythmic, with strong opening (“dusty attic of a vintage bookshop”) and resonant closure. Occasional overwriting appears in mid-story (“paper trails of old letters and books in the attic whispered secrets to her”), where personification verges on purple. One paraphrase loop: “preserve the echo of lost songs” / “melodies that had faded from memory but lingered in her heart” repeats concept within two sentences. Final third remains clean, preserving momentum toward closure without scaffold or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats (“prism terrace shifted, casting rainbow shards that illuminated a doorframe woven of light and shadow”)—figurative density slightly blurs immediacy. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but a few adjacent lines restate the “necessary distances” concept with near-synonymy (“voids but bridges,” “distances that make us whole”). Final paragraph’s cadence is strong, though “fractured beginnings” risks abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though occasional redundancy appears (“she felt a growing sense of anticipation, as if the universe was aligning…” followed by “she felt a profound connection”). Figurative language is coherent (feather as phoenix remnant, ocean as canvas), but “shadowseam wonder” borders on coined abstraction without full grounding. Sentence variety supports rhythm, yet two adjacent lines summarize emotion rather than dramatize it (“She felt… She realized…”).

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with imagery but occasionally overwrites: “delicate as foam, before they vanished forever” borders on redundant, and “cheerful gloom” repeats without deepening. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports accumulation. However, minor paraphrase loops occur (“he conjectured… he conjectured again”) and figurative density in the climax slightly blurs propulsion. No fatal artifacts, but not flawless—cost clarity at closure remains intact despite slight textual padding.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and rhythmic variation, though occasional overwriting appears (“crimson snow,” “modern alchemy”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor register drift in “orchestrated serendipity” leans abstract but is quickly grounded in action. Final paragraph avoids summary, closing with active dreaming. One near-redundancy: “crafted experience that blurred the line between planning and providence” echoes earlier phrasing, but not enough to dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is often exquisite but suffers from figurative density in high-pressure beats: “obsidian grace” repeats, “starlight and soul,” “tides of fate,” “unleashed potential” create a shimmering haze that risks muddling causality. Minor paraphrase loops (“fledging from exile… fledged into something more”) and stacked modifiers (“agonizing yet exquisite,” “spontaneous anchoring that would bind the verse forever”) slightly dull immediacy. Final image remains clear, but artifact accumulation prevents 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “dawn bled light” establishes time, tone, and visual motif). Figurative language is pattern-taught (ripples = consequence) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting in “cathedral of clear complexity”—slightly abstract—but immediately grounded by “radiant storm of color.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; rhythm varies purposefully. Final line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is often evocative (“silvered by moonlight, a ribbon between dark forest and star-strewn sky”), but suffers from repetitive conceptual phrasing: “translate pain,” “universal language,” “hard softness” recur with diminishing returns. The phrase “gently skilled” appears three times in near-identical constructions, creating a paraphrase loop. Figurative density is high but coherent; however, the final third leans into abstraction (“dialect she had learned to speak fluently”) that dulls the concrete power of earlier imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“equations for hope,” “serene upheaval”). Sentence openings vary (“She stood,” “Her work began,” “In one timeline”), and paragraph lengths modulate breath. One minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in mid-story (“dance of observation,” “fabric weakest”) borders on density without payoff, but clarity at closure remains unharmed. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is evocative and precise, with high information density: “half-burned diaries caught her eye” conveys fragility, history, and visual detail in six words. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting appears in “fragile pages from the ash” followed immediately by “charred at the edges”—a slight paraphrase loop. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closure image (“ivy veil rustling with a final, gentle sigh”) is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is consistent (light as paint, song as code, heartbeat as borrowed rhythm) with no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“dusky harmony… muffled the coming change”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but the final paragraph tightens beautifully. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; rhythm supports the accumulative design without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is often vivid (“spiderweb glistening with dew”), but suffers from repetitive phrasing: “operatively gentle” appears three times with minimal variation, and “flawed beauty” is stated then restated. The phrase “ritual significance” feels academic, clashing with the lyrical tone. Several sentences summarize emotion (“doubt and fear”) rather than embody it. Final lines lean into abstraction, dulling the closure’s sensory punch.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative without overwriting; most lines serve multiple functions (e.g., “crystalline crust” conveys setting, metaphor, and thematic fragility). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and figurative language is coherent (cracks as veins, echo as light). Minor redundancy in “manufactured drought” phrasing (lines 2 and 33) slightly dulls momentum, but no loops or scaffold mar peak beats. Final image (“air itself seemed to sing”) resonates without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, often doing double duty, but occasionally overwrites: “pale ghosts,” “spectral threads,” “constellation of lost voices” risk stacking metaphors without clarifying action. No paraphrase loops, but elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration,” “conceptual repricing” implied in tone) slightly distances immediacy. Sentence variety supports rhythm, yet some constructions (“Her existence was a performance…”) lean expository. Closure image remains clear despite minor texture overload.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with high information density—e.g., “whispers echoed like meteors streaking past” merges sound, motion, and metaphor efficiently. However, repetitive phrasing weakens momentum: “half-lit epiphanies” appears four times, “subversive puppet shows” three times, and “meteor hush” five times, creating a scaffold-loop effect. The final paragraph over-relies on restatement (“reversal of expectation,” “twist in the tale,” “ethical storytelling demanded nothing less”), dulling the closure’s impact despite otherwise elegant syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (“blushing stillness,” “transiently rooted”). Figurative language is pattern-taught and paid off (wing as key, arch as signal). One paraphrase loop: “temporary structures as signals” and “language of impermanent monuments” repeat concept within three lines. Final third avoids artifacts, but “truthful acknowledgment of loss” edges toward diagnostic phrasing. Otherwise, rhythm, clarity, and specificity excel.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“holes like tiny windows,” “prismatic sparks”), and sentences vary rhythmically. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“radiant, golden haze,” “tapestry of sound”), slightly blurring focus. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image (“dripped… from the vibrancy of awakened sounds”) is fresh, concrete, and causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“grit of concrete dust mixing with the scent of wet earth and ozone”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“ethereal grit,” “meticulous yet whimsical grace”), slightly stacking modifiers without muddling clarity. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic resolution—calm within chaos—without sacrificing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “frugal sheen,” “dusky harmony,” and “encrypted devotion” each convey character, setting, and theme simultaneously. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—longer cadences for reflection, staccato beats during ritual. Minor overwriting in peak moments (“equations of adoration,” “golden smoke”) borders on purple but avoids muddle. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.9)
    Overwriting plagues high-pressure beats: stacked metaphors (“forgiveness flowed like a river,” “clinging to a sinking stone”) and therapy-speak (“cellular memory,” “shifting grace”) reduce clarity. Paraphrase loops appear (“releasing the deep resentment that festered… resentment began to dissolve”). Sentence openings vary, but figurative density overwhelms propulsion in the climax. Final paragraph’s “melody of renewal” verges on purple prose, dulling the emotional payoff with abstraction instead of concrete sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“reached,” “shimmer,” “snap”) and concrete nouns. Minor overwriting in “ethereal light” and “fragile beauty” slightly dilutes peak beats, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm and focus. Final line (“a new hope lingered”) risks abstraction but is earned by the mirror’s physical presence.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and economical: “scent of blooming apples and decaying stone,” “tears blending with the dew.” Figurative language is controlled, not stacked; metaphors cohere (seasons, mending, growth). Minor redundancy in “forgotten treasures”/“accidental wisdom” near end, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with action. One slight overwriting: “divine decay” edges toward abstraction, but quickly grounded in tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“fruits that hummed with captured starlight,” “meteor”-like insight) and varied syntax that breathes with emotional shifts. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“burned like a cold star,” “flash of insight in the quiet solitude”) but doesn’t obscure clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final line (“light of her hard-won peace”) recharges the orchard’s luminosity with earned emotional weight, closing the cadence cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “volumes piled high into the misty peaks,” “humming with latent knowledge.” Sentences vary rhythmically, advancing plot and atmosphere. One paraphrase loop (“renegotiate their approach… renegotiate their mission”) slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is purposeful, not purple. Final paragraph’s cadence swells appropriately without overwriting. Information density high; no scaffold or redundancy beyond that one echo.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, though occasional overwriting appears (“fog clung like a shroud,” “skeletons of joy”). Sentence variety supports rhythm, but two adjacent lines restate memory alteration (“Memories alter… memories altered”), triggering a minor paraphrase loop. Figurative coherence holds—card as mood ring, ship as prison/sanctuary—but “unkindled solace” recurs as near-label. Closure beat avoids artifacts, preserving impact.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “tick a familiar heartbeat,” “visual static that defied logic” do double duty. Sentence variety supports rhythm—longer for contemplation, clipped for action. Minor overwriting in “profound confusion” (label) slightly dulls peak beat, but quickly redeemed by concrete “blurred space.” No loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Closure image (“clock ticked on... holding the new story”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Syntax varies effectively—short pulses during tension, flowing lines in calm. However, mild paraphrase-loop in describing the stone’s glow (“gently luminous” appears three times with near-identical phrasing) and one instance of stacked modifiers (“violent, unpredictable energy”) slightly dull immediacy. No scaffold or momentum drag; final paragraph resonates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “glass humming pavilion” does setting, sound, and metaphor in three words. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional beats. One minor flaw: “fragments of its past, visions that came unbidden like ghosts” slightly paraphrases itself, but no scaffold loops or register drift. Figurative language is coherent (hush as “shard,” hope as “dandelion clock”) and never muddles peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“each raindrop had awakened the crystal's latent memories”). Figurative language is controlled—no purple prose—and metaphors cohere (fog as time, shadows as memory traces). Minor artifact: slight synonym churn in “deepening hush”/“profound silence”/“heavy hush,” but not enough to obscure clarity. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters fractionally with two adjacent summary lines (“He had sculpted his identity… forever part of the whispering forecourt”), though the last sentence recovers with resonant specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush yet controlled, with high information density: “petals unfurling in the fading light” conveys time, botany, and mood in six words. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with action. However, figurative density peaks risk overload—three metaphors in two lines near the climax (“flame blooming like a transient flower,” “sorrow drawn into the flame’s core,” “mosaic note glow”) flirt with purple prose. No loops or scaffolding, but one paraphrase near redundancy: “defied the void above” / “defiant chord against the silence.”

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely precise, with strong verbs (“carves,” “navigate,” “foresee”) and varied sentence openings. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “pause that stretched like the tide” / “pause in their conversation became a space”; “texture of time... gritty like sand, yet fluid like the incoming tide” recurs near-verbatim. Figurative density is high but coherent—cicada, tide, shell motifs interlock without muddle. Final paragraph’s lyricism risks slight overwriting (“whispered of futures yet to unfold”), though propulsion remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “gravity inverts for an hour” conveys premise economically). Figurative language is purposeful (“walls felt like a slowly closing fist”) and avoids muddle. Minor scaffold in “intangibly tangible” (repeated twice) slightly dulls peak beats, but no loops or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence (“echo of a sky-born quiet”) resolves rhythmically without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is often elegant, with strong verbs (“vaulting hush,” “catalyze a change”) and vivid imagery. Yet repetitive phrasing dulls momentum: “in transit” appears three times, “monitoring noise levels” twice, and “storm glass vial” four times with minimal variation. Adjacent lines sometimes paraphrase (“silence was a comfort… no longer cold or empty but warm”). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; however, the phrase “fluidly logical” reads as label-speak without embodied demonstration, triggering minor register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is fluent but exhibits minor scaffold: repetitive phrasing (“peel away the paint layers,” “hidden murals” appears three times), and adjacent sentences occasionally paraphrase (“time was slipping away; she had until sunrise”). Figurative language is consistent but dense in calm moments, thinning appropriately under pressure. No glaring artifacts, yet “futuristic nostalgia” and “wisely adventurous” read as label-speak. Final paragraph contains slight redundancy (“remembering the night she peeled away layers to find her destiny” echoes earlier action without new insight).

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“void so full of absence it had its own weight”), but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“method of this approach: linking through scars” leans explanatory). No paraphrase loops, but “burns bridges carefully” recurs with slight redundancy. Final paragraph achieves propulsion and clarity, though “unafraid” risks sentimentality. Information density is high, but one or two lines could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences multitask (e.g., “The fungal grotto hummed with a soft, ethereal light, casting shifting blue and green patterns across the damp earth” establishes setting, mood, and sensory texture). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“quantum promise,” “shadowseam wonder”) and pays off without muddle. Minor scaffold in “he had just decided… when his phone buzzed” could be tighter, but no loops or artifacts dull the climax. Final line (“forever changed”) slightly generic, but diamond imagery redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is overwritten: metaphors like “standing waves” and “bridge of intuition” appear without physical logic or payoff, creating figurative muddle. Repetitive phrasing (“golden shadows… golden shadows…”) and template cadences (“He remembered… He saw… He realized…”) dull momentum. Key beats are summarized (“a hidden truth began to emerge”) rather than dramatized. Final paragraph suffers from thematic echo and redundant closure statements.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “gauntleted fingers brushed... finding a faded pamphlet” merges action, object, and discovery). Figurative language is pattern-taught (strings, snapping, light) and avoids muddle. One paraphrase loop: “shivering bliss” repeats four times, risking scaffold—but it’s a charged motif that accumulates meaning, so penalty waived. Final paragraph’s “unsnap the last of his doubts” slightly echoes earlier phrasing, but propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and controlled, with strong verbs (“unfurled,” “clattered,” “swelled”) and varied syntax. Information density is high—each sentence advances character, setting, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“palimpsest of time,” “hollow quiet that echoed in Elara's heart”), slightly blurring immediacy. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase-loop: “magnify small kindnesses” / “magnifying these small kindnesses” reduces propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: “carefully resourceful,” “revised histories,” “tyranny of indifference,” and “coded freedom” repeat with minimal variation across adjacent lines. Figurative density is high but unpatterned—puddles, lagoons, keys, starlight accrue without causal logic, creating symbolic clutter. The final third contains stacked abstractions (“freedom could be decoded by all”) that obscure emotional clarity. Sentence openings frequently recycle “He...” or “The...”, triggering template-cadence penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“As dewdrops formed...” appears three times verbatim), creating a paraphrase loop that dulls momentum. Overuse of “vested hush,” “quietly vivid,” and “eerie nostalgia” as near-synonymous labels reduces specificity. Figurative density is high in low-pressure beats but muddles causality in climax (“hush deepened, a quietly vivid force”). Final paragraph’s scaffold (“He was... guardian... sentinel”) feels declarative rather than earned through image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: “mossy delight” repeats six times, verging on scaffold. Some sentences stack modifiers (“vast tree whose branches wove through the grey heavens”) without propulsion. However, rhythm varies naturally, paragraph lengths shift with emotional beats, and lines often multitask (e.g., “With a delicate prod... revealing patterns that whispered” advances action, character, and atmosphere). A paraphrase loop occurs in the final third (“emerged transformed always” x3), dulling closure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but precise, with high information density—“pendulums whispered secrets of order,” “moss illuminated walls carved with ancient maps.” Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and metaphors cohere (ash as rebirth, leaves as chaos). Minor overwriting appears in the final paragraph (“hard-won peace,” “tapestry of revelation”), where figurative density slightly obscures propulsion. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines summarize the journey (“pattern of coincidences unfolded like a map... threads in a tapestry”), triggering a −0.3 paraphrase-loop penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rain-washed foundry,” “shimmering, verifiable heat patterns,” “luminous regret” do triple duty (atmosphere, character, theme). Minor overwriting in “factually mystical artifact whose celestial engravings were not mere decoration but a documented key…” slightly bogs momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Closure line (“regret illuminated by… peace”) resonates without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is often overwritten: adjacent sentences paraphrase (“her task complete… succeeded”; “cycle of collecting… embraced it”). Repetitive stems (“Elara… Elara… Elara”) and stacked modifiers (“modestly fearless,” “hidden sunrise,” “luminous ache”) create syntactic monotony. Figurative density peaks in high-pressure moments without payoff, dulling the closure beat (“carried the luminous ache within her” echoes earlier phrasing without progression).

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “proprioceptively enhanced” immediately conveys consequence; “black water under violet canopy” merges image and mood. Minor overwriting in “precise coordinates of its own suffering” edges toward abstraction, but most figurative language is grounded (“cold pewter strap had bitten”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Final paragraph avoids summary, landing on charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is evocative with strong information density—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence rhythm varies, and paragraph cuts serve momentum. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “elusively tangible” recurs as near-label, and “unfasten the layers of forgetting” leans metaphorical without grounding action. No loops or scaffold, but figurative language occasionally borders on ornamental (“tapestry,” “beacon”) without altering causality. Final lines avoid purple prose, maintaining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. Figurative language is sparse but potent (“silence felt heavier”). One paraphrase loop: “weightless burden” appears three times with diminishing returns, slightly dulling the closure beat. Otherwise, high information density—each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence beautifully echoes the opening, creating resonant closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“knowledge hung like ripe fruit on crystalline branches”) and strong verbs (“imprint,” “fray,” “pulse”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “dizzying tapestry of existence” leans slightly abstract amid otherwise concrete imagery. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one register drift (“tapestry”) nudges against Elara’s operational lexicon. Rhythm varies effectively, and final line resonates with opening motif.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (time as golden threads, sorrow as burnished) and pays off in the holographic revelation. Minor overwriting appears in “poetically inclined mind finding solace in fragments of the past”—slightly abstract—but quickly grounded by concrete action. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies effectively. Closure image (“glowed with the captured time”) avoids purple prose by tying metaphor to established mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and generally economical, with strong verbs (“pulsed,” “wilt,” “tethered”) and purposeful figurative language. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “mending what isn't torn, fixing the unseen fractures” and later “mending what isn't torn, he stitched the fabric of reality” verge on conceptual redundancy. Minor scaffold in reflective passages (“He remembered the stories…”) slightly dulls momentum. No fatal artifacts, but density dips in mid-story exposition, preventing 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “resonant hush,” “obsidian” water, “stone icicles” do triple duty (image, mood, character). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, plot, or interiority. Figurative language is restrained in peak beats—compass “pulsing,” water “shockingly cold”—avoiding purple overload. Final paragraph’s cadence (“walked home… quest now sensibly complete”) perfectly echoes opening, closing the loop without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“pry,” “scaffold,” “reimagine”) and sensory specificity. Minor overwriting in “swirling, depthless nebula of captured moments” slightly muddles the slide’s mechanics. No loops or scaffold, but “perpetually learning” recurs without deepening. Final paragraph’s rhythm breathes effectively, supporting closure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwritten—phrases like “umbral tenderness” and “dawning hush” recur with near-mechanical cadence, creating slight loop artifacts. Sentences often multitask, yet some lines summarize what could be dramatized (“She reckoned with the silence of her own heart”). Final third avoids major artifacts, but “faded images whispering secrets” edges into metaphor cliché. Overall propulsion remains strong, though density occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“paced,” “shimmered,” “etched”) and purposeful figurative language (“sheet of black glass”). Information density is high—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. However, slight overwriting in the vision sequence (“fragments from the letters,” “snippets of past conversations”) verges on redundancy. No fatal loops, but a few adjacent lines summarize rather than dramatize (“she saw how decisions were made…”).

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure, though occasional paraphrase loops appear (“rejected the false comfort… rejected the false comfort of seeking another wish-granter”). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; the “skeleton of paper and dust” metaphor risks mixed imagery. Information density is high—most lines advance theme, character, or setting—but the final paragraph’s “alchemy of human ingenuity and memory” edges into abstract summary. No scaffold or register drift harms closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: “wax curls falling like pale petals” ties tool to setting, while “velvet disquiet” merges texture and tone. Sentence variety supports rhythm—long, winding clauses for memory; staccato phrases for discovery. However, two adjacent sentences paraphrase the prophecy’s impact (“inevitable and terrifying… a truth uncovered”), creating a minor loop. Figurative density spikes in the climax without muddle, but “charged Poise”-level precision falters slightly in the final paragraph’s summary of his new purpose, which tells more than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line efficiency. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and figurative language is largely coherent. Yet “wild serenity” and “furious tranquility” appear as repeated conceptual anchors rather than evolving perceptions, creating minor paraphrase loops. One mixed metaphor (“sound like fracturing ice” followed by “soft light spilled”) slightly blurs sensory logic in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally vivid but suffers from repetitive phrasing: “After the glue dried” appears verbatim twice; “zero hour” is overused; “solstice hush” recurs without deepening. Several adjacent lines restate concepts (“favor listening over noise” / “silence more powerful than sound”). Figurative language is sparse but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence falters with stacked abstractions (“balance between duty and compassion… meaningful… vigilant…”), slightly dulling closure’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often beautiful but suffers from paraphrase loops and redundant phrasing: “tracing the path of falling stars” appears four times with minimal variation; “flourishing stillness” and “primal elegance” recur as near-synonyms without progression. Sentences like “He found strength in admitting his fears, and that vulnerability made him resilient” summarize rather than dramatize. Figurative language is dense but occasionally borders on purple (“cradle for new beginnings”). These artifacts dull momentum and obscure precise emotional shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without overwriting: “ghosts drifted like pale smoke,” “warmth spread from it” advance atmosphere and plot. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with tension. Minor redundancy in “tranquilly perceptive” repeated twice, and “contextual clues” appears three times with diminishing returns—small scaffold loops. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closure beat (“understood everything without a single word spoken”) lands cleanly with earned quietude.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“emerald silo,” “tapestry of time”) and varied syntax. However, mild overwriting occurs in peak beats: “time passing was not a countdown, but a melody” edges toward mixed metaphor after “tapestry.” No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent lines summarize the capsule’s purpose redundantly (“bridging past and present… served its purpose”). Final paragraph has slight scaffold (“rediscovered joy… noticed how people began…”), dulling propulsion just before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“burnished hush,” “woven dawns” repeated). Minor paraphrase loops exist (“tend to his thoughts,” “tend to the moment”). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; however, “woven dawns” edges toward unearned abstraction. Final paragraph avoids purple prose, landing cleanly on concrete images. Strong information density, though a few lines could be trimmed for propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful: sentences advance character, setting, and theme simultaneously (e.g., “cage of confinement” vs. “lattice for potential”). Figurative language is coherent (stone as “sleeping giants,” copper as “conductor”), with no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold appears in “her plan was radical… she would remodel…” but is offset by strong verbs and varied syntax. Final paragraph avoids summarization, closing on a charged image—the intertwined sketch—that resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Strong verbs (“strangled,” “converge,” “crystallized”) and concrete nouns anchor abstraction. Rhythm varies effectively; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “dusty footprints… footprints that seemed to guide” slightly redundant. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; closure beat remains uncluttered and luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: phrases like “submerged concord of this place was a hidden harmony” verge on abstraction. Repetition of key terms (“blooming jetty,” “narrow vastness,” “after the reef dies”) creates cohesion but borders on paraphrase-looping in the final third. Sentence openings vary well, yet figurative density remains high throughout without cadence shift under pressure. The closing paragraph’s lyricism slightly dulls propulsion with near-redundant affirmations.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “veins were a map he could no longer read”). Sentence variety supports rhythm; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “distance into closeness” appears twice with slight variation. Figurative coherence holds—no mixed metaphors—but “wild hush” borders on abstract; however, it’s grounded by tactile context. Closure beat remains artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line efficiency (“temporally stretched air seeming to thin in anticipation”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “confusion about the shutdown, about his purpose here alone” slightly redundant. Figurative language is controlled—“liquid motion,” “echoed silence”—but “warped his perception of the void outside” verges on generic. No scaffold or momentum-dragging; every image serves atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“a needle of ancient ice stabbing into a heavens gone awry” establishes setting, tone, and stakes). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “violet smears,” “sickly green halo,” “frayed edges of reality” risk stacked modifiers, though coherence holds. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence resonates without drumbeat repetition. One slight register drift (“mending tapestry”) borders on abstraction but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“nomadic penumbra,” “luminous absence”) is consistent and payoff-ready. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“grace of a hand offered in despair… blink of an eye holding unshed tears”)—slightly abstract for peak pressure—but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “substituted reality with visions drawn from the shimmering liquid metal” compresses motive, method, and metaphor. Figurative language is pattern-taught (mercury = escape, thunder = change) and never muddled. Minor redundancy in “buried talents stirred, aching to be used, to rebuild what was broken” slightly dulls immediacy, but no loops or scaffold mar key beats. Final paragraph’s rhythm—“walked the shelves, ready to face the dawn”—resolves with clean, resonant cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information yield per line. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and figurative language is coherent (chess metaphors extend naturally to life). Minor overwriting in “tempest of regret within” borders on label-speak but is offset by embodied actions. No loops or scaffold; momentum never stalls. Final line (“won a future”) slightly generic but redeemed by preceding specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “The price of forgiveness... was to acknowledge every one of these shards”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“refract,” “shards,” “prismatic”) and coheres without muddle. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“glittering fragment of what truth could be”) slightly dilutes clarity but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence—no scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwrought: phrases like “conjured meaning from the edge of oblivion” and “quilt of collective consciousness” verge on abstraction. Minor redundancy in describing the charm’s function across beats. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm, but figurative density in high-pressure beats slightly dulls immediacy. No fatal artifacts, though “kintsugi intentions” leans toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “salt-stung present,” “temporary eternity,” “fractured heart” each do multiple jobs. Sentence openings vary (“Elara dipped…”, “Driven by…”, “The air inside…”), avoiding template cadence. One minor slip: “painful yet liberating” borders on label-speak but is immediately grounded by “fingers trembling.” No loops or scaffold; every paragraph advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final line (“ever-changing tide”) resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but purposeful; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“heat wave shattered like glass,” “screaming tenderness”) is coherent and resonant. Minor overwriting in the middle (“vibrations of intent… purifying intentions”) borders on label-speak but is quickly grounded in action. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Final paragraph’s cadence beautifully echoes the opening, fulfilling lyric closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“metal island under the cold cosmos,” “hanging in the air like a promise”) is consistent and grounded. Minor redundancy appears in “build a new kind of compass… build a resonator… building a bridge,” but these serve thematic reinforcement rather than loop. The final line’s clarity (“the voice had been her own all along”) lands cleanly without over-explanation. No scaffold, no purple excess—just controlled lyricism that breathes with the lunar cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “leaking vessel of unvarnished fact” conveys state, metaphor, and history). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“searing bolt,” “inner light,” “static silence”) edges toward figurative saturation, but pattern is taught early (“whipping in the storm’s fury”) and pays off. No loops or scaffold; every image serves escalation or closure. Deduction only for slight redundancy in “fractured grace” appearing twice near end.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely evocative and precise, with strong verbs (“vanished,” “seep in,” “crystallized”) and varied sentence structure. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “a feeling as insidious as the damp air” edges into mixed metaphor, and “fragile and foreign” leans on stock pairing. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent lines summarize Elias’s method redundantly (“observing gaps… silences between the words”). Final paragraph’s clarity and propulsion offset these small artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “glimmer,” “creek crested,” “blooming cavern” all pull double duty. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and paragraph cuts align with emotional beats. One paraphrase loop: “haunted by a lingering promise… the memory of that vow pressed upon him” repeats the same idea across adjacent lines. Also, “glimmer” appears six times—effective motif but risks overuse; still, each instance advances plot or mood, avoiding scaffold penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush yet mostly purposeful, with high information density (“clouds swirled below, a sea of white hiding the kingdom she no longer felt part of”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“liquid mercury,” “eyes as old as the mountains”), and “softly commanding” repeats as label. No fatal loops, but “bleeding starlight” leans on metaphor without grounding physics, risking slight figurative muddle at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but largely controlled; figurative language serves accumulation (“ember nexus pulsed,” “palette of resolve”). However, peak beats risk overwriting: “density of presence,” “revalue the nexus itself,” and “directed spontaneity” verge on abstract labels. A paraphrase loop appears in the climax (“revalue… revalue herself… revalue the nexus”), slightly dulling propulsion. Sentence variety and paragraph cuts are strong, and the final line lands cleanly—but minor scaffold phrases dilute otherwise high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict (“silence so profound it felt like a physical weight”). Figurative language is purposeful—“deck of cards thrown into a hurricane” concretizes chronological confusion without muddle. Minor scaffold in “feral nostalgia had me in its jaws, shaking me like a rag doll” slightly over-extends the metaphor, but it’s isolated. Final paragraph’s cadence (“quiet one, inside my chest”) earns its lyricism through prior restraint. No loops or register drift; every image ties to the central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“clung,” “muffling,” “glistening”) and selective sensory detail. Sentences vary in structure and length, avoiding monotony. Minor overwriting in “trembling calm” repetition (three times), creating a faint paraphrase loop. Final paragraph’s cadence slightly templates (“She… She… She…”), but it’s intentional lyricism. No clarity loss; artifacts don’t touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information-per-line (e.g., “gem-like formations spread from each rune stroke, capturing her anxiety”). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “brittle, beautiful patterns” and “vivid depictions of her journeys” verge on stacked modifiers. No paraphrase loops, but “crystallized” repeats functionally; final paragraph’s “fleeting breath between trials” slightly dilutes closure’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “paper ghosts of compositions past,” “haunting melody... softened into a lullaby.” Sentences vary rhythmically, advancing atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent (hauntings as stuck records, spirits woven into roots). Minor overwriting in “shimmer with invisible forces,” but no artifacts dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“wanderingly exact,” “resounding hush,” “across a universe’s hiccup”) deployed as refrain rather than evolving motif. Adjacent sentences often paraphrase: e.g., “He walked on… His inward journey reflecting…” followed by near-identical restatements. Figurative density is high but static—metaphors accumulate without deepening or contradiction. The final third relies on summary (“cosmic illusions were unraveled”) rather than dramatized revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Recurring phrases (“razor edges,” “eminently peculiar,” “squint”) are pattern-taught and payoff-integrated, not loops. Minor redundancy in “after blowing the whistle” (used three times)—justified as refrain but slightly dilutes propulsion. Figurative language is coherent (water = time, gears = boundaries), though “space between moments” verges on abstraction. Final paragraph achieves earned stillness without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but precise, with strong verbs (“seeped,” “pulsed,” “harmonize”) and varied syntax. Information density is high: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“a quiet wildfire of understanding, burning without noise”), where metaphor slightly duplicates prior imagery. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines restate the laser’s purpose (“testing… through permeable barriers”). Closure beat remains artifact-free, preserving momentum through the birdsong deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally tipping into overwriting (“tapestry of probabilities,” “vines” of sorrow and hope). Minor paraphrase loops appear: “widen perspectives responsibly” repeats as mantra without new pressure. The phrase “lucid contradictions” recurs like a thesis statement, verging on thematic echo. Yet sentence variety, strong verbs (“traverse,” “etch,” “crystallized”), and sensory specificity maintain momentum. Closure image remains clear despite lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line yield (“cord coiled like a sleeping serpent,” “streetlamps hum their night song”). Figurative language is pattern-taught and paid off—the harmonica’s “melodically haunted tone” returns to clarify thought. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for slight overuse of lyrical abstraction in one mid-paragraph (“larger composition”), but closure remains sharp and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting dilutes momentum: “haunted euphoria” appears four times, verging on paraphrase-loop. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm breathes with scene needs. However, “gently thorough” and “regenerated covenant” verge on label-speak without sufficient dramatization, triggering minor scaffold penalties. Closure image remains sharp despite these frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere (“silence and vines conspired to bury the past”). Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors; “polite anarchy” crystallizes tone without overuse. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor scaffold in “catalysis of emotion he could not name,” but immediate embodiment (“jocular desperation punctured his shield”) redeems it. No loops or artifacts dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“Her ring pulsed… she adjusted her path”). Figurative language is purposeful—“psychic dew,” “library of experience”—without muddle. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with scene needs. Minor deduction: slight overuse of “vibration”/“resonance” near climax risks echo, but never obscures closure. Zero loops or scaffolding; every line earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “time felt thin,” “crooked story… twisted perceptions,” “cascade of relational truth” each do thematic, atmospheric, and character work. Figurative language is consistent (agricultural/threshing metaphors woven with cosmic signal lexicon). Minor scaffold in “she was meticulously revising…” slightly dulls immediacy, but no loops or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence shift (“not fixed everything… but threshed…”) delivers closure with rhythmic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears (“luminous harbor lay still,” “radiant embrace”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is largely coherent (silence as “symphony,” camera as “vessel of perception”), though “joyful sorrow” edges toward abstraction. The final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with repetitive emotional labeling, but the closing image (“melody that would echo in his heart forever”) lands with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely precise and evocative, with strong verbs (“clutched,” “mended,” “torched”) and selective sensory detail. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “volcanic tenderness” repeats as near-label, and phrases like “passionate fury beneath a surface of gentle reverence” verge on abstraction. A paraphrase loop occurs in the curator’s trail description (“tiny etchings... faded murals... each piece a step”). These don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+ due to slight figurative muddle in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: metaphors accumulate densely in peak moments (“auroral sorrow,” “cosmic stillness,” “symphony of light”), risking figurative muddle. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“quietly rebellious” repeated verbatim; “entangled memories” restated without progression). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports theme, but the final third leans on summary (“had become,” “had taken”) rather than dramatization. Information density is high, yet some lines prioritize beauty over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “folds a lifetime of routes,” “storm-lit darkness,” “charged air” do double duty in atmosphere and character. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs. One slight overwriting cluster: “shifting hues of green and purple, disorienting the uninitiated” leans decorative. No loops or scaffolding; every line propels. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors the quiet closure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“spiralingly calm,” “stillwater tension” recur with slight redundancy). No paraphrase loops, but some sentences stack metaphors (“a black mirror hiding forgotten things,” “map of hope for the drowned”) that risk blurring focus. Sentence openings vary, rhythm supports mood, and information density is high. Minor scaffold in “half-spoken secret” repetition slightly dulls momentum, but closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but mostly controlled; sentences vary in length and structure, with strong verbs (“pacing,” “cradled,” “ignited”). However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms: “amplified quiet,” “constellation of dissent,” “tapestry of unease” risk stacking metaphors without grounding. No paraphrase loops, but slight redundancy in “humble rebellion”/“quiet resistance”/“amplified quiet revolution.” Final paragraph’s cadence resolves well, though “forests of second thoughts grew deep and enduring” edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “grace... hidden beneath grime and sweat” conveys character, setting, and conflict). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with tide imagery. One paraphrase loop: “detach... not just from the dock... but from the fear” slightly restates. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “combative tenderness” risks label-speak—redeemed by immediate embodiment (“fierce, protective love”). Closure beat remains artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information yield per line (e.g., “remade hush of the countryside into something manufactured and deep” conveys sound, politics, and emotion). Minor overwriting appears in adjacent metaphors (“skeleton of color holding the dust of memory” / “map of loss”), risking slight redundancy, but no loops or scaffold dilute momentum. Sentence variety supports accumulation—short staccato phrases amid flowing clauses mirror turbine rhythm. Closure image (“one whittled shaving at a time”) lands with resonant simplicity, avoiding purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with figurative language but largely coherent; however, adjacent lines occasionally restate concepts (“boundaries dissolved,” “layers of separation”) creating mild paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes appropriately, and information density is high. One register drift: “tremor of certainty—a doubt that solidified into truth” borders on diagnostic abstraction. No scaffold or simultaneity errors; closure image remains sharp despite minor overwriting in mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished, with varied syntax and strong verbs (“molded,” “gnarled,” “vibrate”). Figurative language is controlled—phoenix sky “ablaze,” reed tongue “alive with music”—without purple excess. Minor redundancy in final paragraph (“imperfect beauty,” “exquisite in the incomplete”) slightly dilutes closure. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Read-aloud rhythm flows naturally, though one or two stacked modifiers (“subtle graces and hidden depths”) verge on ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but disciplined, with high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“In the deep quiet…”, “Her fingers…”, “The world outside…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“spontaneous harmony,” “gentle intelligence”)—figurative density occasionally edges toward purple—but never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; the sole flaw is a slight register drift in the final paragraph (“testament to resilience”) that verges on abstract declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and mostly concise, with strong verbs (“parted,” “illuminated,” “whispered”) and varied sentence openings. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “genuinely artificial comfort that made her feel genuinely seen” uses redundant adverbs, and “subdued ardor burning steadily as she helped others see” borders on abstract assertion. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences near the end restate the blooming metaphor with slight synonym churn (“withering was merely the prelude to blooming” / “teaching withering to bloom again”), costing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: “reverse engineering” appears three times with near-identical context; “multiplying paths” repeats four times without functional evolution. These artifacts flatten momentum and obscure escalation. Figurative language is consistent but overused in high-pressure beats, creating density without propulsion. Final paragraph tightens well, but earlier redundancy prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though occasional redundancy appears (“steadily unpredictable” repeated; “anguished joy” named thrice). Figurative density is high but coherent—light fractures, memories flood, atoms swirl—all serving purification motif. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths modulate pace. One paraphrase loop: “forbidden knowledge... quest that defined her existence” echoes without added pressure. Closure beat remains sharp despite minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “children's dreams of flying over green fields” vs. “distorted, grey landscapes”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is precise (“shadow unbound,” “tapestry of reconciled memories”) without muddle. Minor deduction: one slightly ornamental phrase (“softly deliberate grace”) borders on label, but overall propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “mist curled… silver shroud” establishes tone economically. Figurative language is controlled—“fragile as a bird’s egg” earns its place through later action. Minor scaffold in “shed that memory back… shed the layer…” risks template cadence but pays off thematically. Zero loops or redundancy; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Closure line (“more vividly herself”) recharges “quietly vivid” with earned specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “His mind felt raw, scraped clean, yet the old hunger remained” conveys state, contradiction, and motive). Figurative language is coherent (scars as stories, rings as maps) with no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “displaced miracle” repetition (−0.2), but no loops or artifacts dull closure. Final line’s “soft click” perfectly echoes opening stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and varied rhythm, though occasional figurative stacking (“shimmering, fractured crystals adrift in a gray expanse”) edges toward density without pattern-teaching. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Closure beat (“The tune was found, not in a song, but in the act of remembering”) is clean and resonant. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in mid-section, but no artifacts obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is often beautiful but occasionally overwritten: phrases like “remembered stardust” and “shadowed rapture” repeat without deepening, creating a slight paraphrase loop. Figurative density is high throughout, including in peak beats, bordering on purple prose (“bittersweet ecstasy woven from beauty and sorrow”). Sentence openings vary well, but some passages summarize emotion rather than embody it. Final third avoids major artifacts, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“flowers pulsed like slow heartbeats,” “sparks clinging to the ghost of a story”). Rhythm varies naturally, with paragraph lengths shaping visual cadence. Minor overwriting appears in mid-text (“weaving probability into a gentle invitation”), but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Figurative language remains coherent—wave functions, sparks, and lullaby form a consistent motif system without muddle, though one or two stacked modifiers slightly blur propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically, avoiding monotony. High information density—e.g., “vines of coiled wire hung heavy with glowing fruit” conveys setting, function, and mood. One paraphrase loop: “hum of insight” described thrice with slight redundancy. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; closure beat (“joined its song”) avoids overwriting. Minor deduction for stacked modifiers in “colossal structure, a nexus of interwoven gears and pulleys.”

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “dizzying freedom” or “patience of ages,” but figurative language remains coherent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors the shoreline lullaby—soothing yet propulsive. One slight redundancy: “shoreline lullaby” repeats three times, slightly diluting its charge.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “blue-metal walls absorbing the weak daylight” conveys color, material, light, mood). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor redundancy in “unpardonable silence” phrasing (used three times) slightly dulls impact, but no loops or scaffold mar key beats. Final paragraph’s “thawing the edges of his frostbitten hope” avoids cliché through precise metaphor integration.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“blooming like a night flower,” “graceful collapse”) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting in the opening (“strata of dust,” “weight of epochs in his eyes”) risks purple prose, but rhythm recovers through varied sentence structure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image (“small yet immense in the settling dust”) is impeccably clear and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely precise and propulsive, with strong verbs (“dipping,” “etched,” “colonize”) and varied syntax. However, “periodically eternal” repeats as a conceptual crutch rather than evolving through action, creating slight scaffolding. No paraphrase loops, but the phrase’s recurrence borders on label-only in peak beats. Final paragraph’s cadence earns its quietness without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“clutched,” “thrums,” “coalesce”) and varied sentence openings. Information density is high—each image serves atmosphere, character, and theme. However, two adjacent lines (“Meaning began to coalesce from the mess; every scattered part had its place in the whole”) verge on paraphrase-loop, slightly dulling momentum. No scaffold or purple prose; closure beat remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with strong verbs (“pulsed,” “infused,” “woven”) and varied syntax. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “radiating a faint, warm light” followed by “golden clarity” edges toward stacked modifiers. No loops or scaffold, but the phrase “unsealed by courage” in the final line veers close to thematic echo, slightly dulling the closure’s subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely precise and evocative, with high information density (“salt-scorched earth,” “rhythmic pulse,” “soft weight”). However, recurring phrases like “pearl of stillness” and “somatic markers” verge on conceptual labels rather than embodied experience, especially in high-pressure beats. A slight paraphrase loop appears in the reflection on grief (“observe these bodily signals… use them as a map”). Final paragraph tightens beautifully, but mid-story figurative density occasionally edges toward abstraction without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “luminescent ache” does triple duty (sensory, emotional, thematic). Sentences vary rhythmically—long, flowing clauses for reflection; staccato phrases for tension (“The walls were so close now”). Minimal scaffolding; every image advances atmosphere or character. One slight overwriting slip: “kaleidoscope of half-remembered smiles” edges toward abstraction but is anchored by immediate concrete details (splintered box, faded High Priestess).

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is selective (“skin like bleached bone,” “frozen waves”) and consistent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; momentum flows from eclipse to epiphany. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “swirls and fractals that existed for only a moment before fading”—redundant adverbial emphasis—but this doesn’t dull closure. Final line (“He was alone, but no longer searching”) resonates cleanly, echoing the opening’s solitude with transformed meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from paraphrase loops: “contraband truths” repeated 5 times, “dizzying quiet” 3 times, “unspoken conversation” 4 times—many in adjacent lines. Figurative density peaks during upload (“fire in the frozen dark”) without payoff. Sentence openings vary well, but synonym churn (“scandalize,” “expose,” “reveal”) dilutes precision. Final paragraph’s momentum stalls with restated concepts instead of forward propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs and concrete nouns (“thorny stems,” “ballast sandbag”). However, minor overwriting appears: “tranquil blaze” recurs as a near-cliché, and phrases like “weave continuity through chaos” verge on abstraction. No paraphrase loops, but figurative density occasionally blurs causality (e.g., plants “absorbing values” leans metaphorical without tactile grounding). Final paragraph’s lyricism works but borders on ornamental summation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “audible ripples shaped themselves into floral forms” establishes setting, concept, and tone in one stroke. Figurative language is consistent—sound as landscape, emotion as vibration—without muddle. Minor scaffold in mid-section (“He knew that direct paths…”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops, synonym churn, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence recharges motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “orbits of regret” conveys generational guilt in three words; “solemn playfulness” captures tonal complexity economically. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “festering in the dark” slightly strains metaphor coherence, but doesn’t obscure causality. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Final keystroke image resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful metaphor (“time folded in on itself,” “tether the frayed threads of time”) that coheres under the sonic/celestial motif. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“agonizing reminders,” “spectral noise”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure beat is clean and resonant. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary effectively. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors the “meteor hush” it describes.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful: “mist clung,” “sands into intricate loops,” “hush held them.” Figurative language is sparse in high-pressure beats (woman’s outburst), reserving lyricism for thematic moments. Minor overwriting in two spots (“beautiful, chaotic connections they still shared”; “lavender clarity”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports rhythm, though one run of participial phrases near climax risks simultaneity error.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful (“prisons of sensation,” “canvas for potential dawns”) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “retrocognitively trapped” exposition (slightly clinical), but quickly grounded in sensation. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final lines avoid summary, resolving through resonant image (“one step at a time”).

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but precise, with high information density (“moonlit fruits glowed like forgotten stage lights” conveys setting, metaphor, and theme). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/stage motifs recur) and pays off in the footlights/apple parallel. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“cascade of emotion that painted the air in weeping violets”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops or scaffold mar clarity. Final line’s simplicity (“a smile on her lips”) earns its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“fractally precise layers seeming to mirror the complexity of neural networks” leans explanatory). No paraphrase loops, but “fractally precise” recurs as a near-label without evolving mechanics. Sentence variety supports momentum, and the final image (“complex, beautiful network of light that felt alive”) lands cleanly. One scaffold sentence: “He needed to devise a method…” could be shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with evocative imagery and rhythmic control, though occasional overwriting appears in peak beats (“symphony of heat signatures,” “tapestry of transition”)—metaphors that verge on abstraction without grounding. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony; sentence openings vary. Information density is high: each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for two adjacent lines summarizing emotional content (“grief… resilience… joy”) rather than dramatizing it sensorially.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“swirl of captured sound,” “fossilized insect”) and varied sentence structure. Information-rich lines advance plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor overwriting appears in mid-section (“mapping the branching rivers of chance”)—a slight figurative stretch—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; final paragraph’s cadence resonates without redundancy. Closure beat remains clear and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic (“mist coiling like forgotten secrets,” “silver hush”), with strong verbs and specific nouns. Occasional overwriting: “prudently daring” risks label-speak, though it’s redeemed by on-page demonstration. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Minor register drift in “vouchsafe” (archaic for spy context), but consistent with Elias’s formalized past.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is evocative but over-dense in figurative language—“spindrift serenity,” “memories percolate,” “palimpsest promise” recur with near-identical phrasing, creating synonym loops. Adjacent lines often restate concepts (“percolate” appears four times; “ambient awareness” twice). Final paragraph avoids major artifacts, but mid-story cadence suffers from templated repetition (“He remembered… He thought… He realized…”). Information density is high, yet momentum drags under lyrical scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual breath. Minor overwriting in “fractured timelines... splinter like faulty pottery” slightly strains metaphor coherence, but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; information density high without padding.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “skeletal frame of the rosebush” implies history; “slick with sea damp” conveys texture and time. Sentence openings vary (“After…”, “Elara…”, “She…”, “Taking up…”), and paragraph lengths shift with emotional beats. Minor overwriting in “quivering hush” repetition (three mentions), but it’s pattern-taught and closure-resolved. No loops or scaffold; every image serves theme or character. Figurative language is coherent (light as water, hush as cloak)—no mixed metaphors or purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “books floating gently on air currents” conveys setting, mood, and physics in six words. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional beats. Minor overwriting in “fragile and fleeting” (synonym proximity), and “profound isolation” edges toward abstraction, but peak beats avoid figurative muddle. Closure image—sundial showing “clear and unwavering” self amid ghosts—is sharp, uncluttered, and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“prismatic quiet,” “thrush’s nest twig spiral”), but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “a living tapestry of whispered confessions and hopes” verges on abstraction. Minor paraphrase loop in describing the spiral’s growth (“each strand she added was like a sentence… a piece of a larger story”). Otherwise, rhythm varies skillfully, and every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and generally precise (“static hissed from the speakers, a white noise sea”), with strong verbs and sensory specificity. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “ethereal grit” and “monumental risk,” which verge on label-speak. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one mixed metaphor (“white noise sea he was paid to navigate”) slightly blurs imagery. Closure beat remains artifact-free and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid but suffers from recurring syntactic patterns (“She...”, “The...”) and conceptual redundancy—e.g., “spatial mutiny” appears six times with minimal variation. Phrases like “prudently adventurous heart” and “wistful rebellion” repeat as near-synonym loops, dulling momentum. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Closure beat avoids artifacts, though final paragraph’s “forever changed” verges on summary. Strong verbs and sensory specificity elsewhere elevate line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “faded scrap of velvet ribbon… whispered of a grand party and a terrible silence” does triple duty (object, backstory, tone). Figurative language is controlled—no purple prose—and metaphors cohere (shroud/mist, lancing truth). Minor scaffold in “methodical nature demanded a system; she would lance the truth open”—slightly explanatory—but quickly redeemed by embodied action. Final paragraph avoids loops; every sentence tightens the thematic knot. One paraphrase echo (“unifying opposites” appears twice) costs 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density (“skeletal structure of sensors,” “spongey dread”). Sentence rhythm varies effectively, accelerating during the dive sequence. Minor flaw: “spongey dread” recurs three times with slight variation, bordering on paraphrase-loop; it dulls slightly by the third use. Otherwise, no scaffold, purple prose, or syntactic monotony; closure image (“shifting winds… new tune”) is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose—nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is controlled (“ashes of ‘never,’” “sculpt possibility”) and avoids purple excess. Minor artifact: slight synonym churn around “flutter”/“dance”/“snap” in describing the fabric, and one paraphrase loop (“sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’” appears twice). No syntactic monotony; paragraph lengths vary effectively. Final line (“fragile and bright as glass”) recharges the central object with thematic weight, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line: “leaning like tired giants,” “polished calm,” “territorial markers.” Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop weakens impact: “paths circle back” appears in motivation and resolution with near-identical phrasing, slightly dulling the epiphany. No figurative muddle, but the loop prevents 9+ eligibility per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“fused,” “pulsed,” “mending”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting appears in adjacent lines restating “shared burdens” and “healing with words,” creating faint paraphrase loops. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “balm” and “warmth” verge on stock in peak beats. Closure image remains sharp despite slight density bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “froth of petals and decay,” “tendrils unfurling like tiny hands.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (seeds as dormant promises, ice as rigidity) and pays off. Minor overwriting in “warlike serenity” repeated twice without evolution; one paraphrase loop (“expanding circles” appears three times with diminishing returns). No scaffold, no simultaneity errors, and final line (“never again let confessions freeze in the heart”) resonates without summarizing.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “shadows stretched like long fingers” advances atmosphere and foreshadows portal. Figurative language is pattern-taught (scars as connectors) and payoff-integrated. Minor overwriting in “thrilling yet terrifying blend of possibility and dread”—slightly redundant—but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s rhythm masterfully shifts from tension (“stepped toward the portal”) to release (“glade sighed”), with zero paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful: “soil woven with ancient remains,” “amber and gray” glow advance atmosphere and theme. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats—e.g., “heart a mixture of shadow and determination” risks abstraction, and “fractured fate” edges toward label-speak. No paraphrase loops, but figurative density occasionally slows propulsion (e.g., dual descriptions of roots “snaking” and “embracing”). Final lines avoid scaffold, landing cleanly on the card’s integration.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely clean and propulsive, with strong verbs (“wrest,” “pressing,” “etched”) and varied sentence rhythms. Occasional paraphrase loops (“the echo valley longing that filled the trailer… He longed for the road”) and near-redundant clauses (“a tangible echo of the life he’d lost… a piece of the past he couldn’t let go”) slightly dilute momentum. Figurative language is restrained and coherent; no mixed metaphors or purple prose. Final image lands with quiet resonance, though one or two filter verbs (“he felt anything but”) could be cut.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “pulsating seed,” “magnetic fields bending around obstacles,” “river merging into the sea” avoid mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary (“Elian… stood,” “The air…”, “His work…”, “Left behind…”), and paragraphs shift length purposefully. Minor scaffold in “haunted ambitions whispered of past failures” edges toward label-speak but is redeemed by immediate embodiment (“now he embraced his methodical nature”). No loops or purple prose; every line advances atmosphere, character, or concept.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“crystalline vessels that floated,” “bamboo creel… never overflowed”). Figurative language is coherent (tidal/metal motifs interweave without clash). One paraphrase loop: “preserving wonder in the ceaseless routine” / “find magic in the mundane” slightly redundant. Final third avoids artifacts; closure image (“creel swayed… whisper secrets”) remains clear despite lyricism. High information density sustains momentum without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“cradled,” “erupted”) and controlled figurative language. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor overwriting in “resonant hush” repetition (opening/closing), but it serves lyric payoff. Closure beat remains clear—no artifacts dull the pearl’s activation or Kaelen’s departure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme (e.g., “patched bellows a testament to things mended but never quite whole again”). Figurative language is controlled—river/accordion breathing metaphor recurs without strain. Minor overwriting in “sky bleeding with sunset” edges toward cliché, but rhythm varies effectively (staccato beats during search, legato during playing). No loops or scaffold; information density high. Final paragraph’s “fragile but real” peace risks slight abstraction, but “tape on bellows as resilience” grounds it. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence mirrors accordion’s wheeze.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“pulsating,” “beckon,” “recalibrate”) and sensory specificity. However, three instances of “cautious exuberance” create a paraphrase loop that dulls emotional escalation, and the phrase “cyclically reversed” appears four times with minimal variation, risking scaffold repetition. Figurative language is coherent (mist as decoder, watch as compass), but density occasionally edges toward overwriting in high-pressure beats. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Sentence openings vary (“Her fingers…”, “The plants…”, “She lifted…”), paragraph lengths breathe with tension. Minor overwriting in “mulberry ache, deep and bruise-purple” risks stacked modifiers, but it’s character-consistent. No loops or scaffolding; coffee-stain prophecy avoids paraphrase. Closure image (“clean her cup”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density. Sentences vary in structure and length, supporting ritual cadence. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats (“radiant hush,” “lucidly watchful” repeated) and slight synonym churn (“infuse,” “channel,” “transmute”) risks figurative saturation. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase pair (“threshold of stillness deepened… wrapping the grotto”) slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft shows strong imagery and varied sentence structure, but suffers from paraphrase loops: “forgiving the unforgivable” repeats verbatim four times, and “climbing trees to think better” recurs with minimal variation. The phrase “vineyard hush” appears three times as a refrain but borders on scaffolded motif. Figurative language is dense in high-pressure beats (e.g., “cocoon of peace,” “sanctuary of shadows”) without pattern-teaching, risking slight overwriting. Momentum holds, but redundancy dulls some impact.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “whispering through the grasses,” “chaotic music a backdrop to her shifting perspective” merge atmosphere with interiority. Minimal scaffolding—each sentence advances character or pressure. One minor flaw: slight overuse of metaphor in mid-story (“cloak of doubt billowing,” “spectrum of choices”) risks purple prose, but clarity holds. Final lines earn lyricism through concrete payoff (“breeze at his back, a conscience for hire ever weaving doubt into clarity”).

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, but mostly purposeful—each image serves theme or state. However, slight overwriting in mid-section (“tapestry of mist and stone,” “starlit silence,” “sycamore hush”) edges toward purple. No paraphrase loops, but three adjacent sentences use water/ripple metaphors without escalation, triggering minor density penalty (−0.3). Closure beat remains clear, so artifact impact is contained.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though minor overwriting occurs (“harmonic stone skimmer moved with slow, deliberate grace” slightly redundant). No paraphrase loops, but “centuries of layered dust” appears three times—functional as refrain, not artifact. Figurative language is coherent (echoes as resonance, birds as intuition). Final paragraph’s cadence strengthens closure, though “timeless truth emerged” leans abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and varied syntax, avoiding monotony. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “accommodating impossibilities as the spire transformed, its walls now adorned with living vines and gentle whispers of wind” stacks modifiers without propulsion. A paraphrase loop occurs between “lingering luminance” and “brilliant dimness” across adjacent paragraphs, slightly dulling momentum. Otherwise, line-level craft is strong—concrete verbs, specific nouns, and rhythmic control support the accumulative design without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“meteor hush,” “luminous pathway”) and pays off in the library’s chromatic symphony. Minor overwriting appears in “bowled under the weight of waterlogged books” (slightly redundant), but no loops, scaffold, or register drift mar key beats. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and the final lines (“each step a purposeful wander through a world newly painted”) echo the opening with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“After the universe contracted…”, “She held…”, “One day…”), and paragraph lengths modulate rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “wavelength align with purpose” and “stellar doubt,” which flirt with jargon but are redeemed by contextual grounding. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent (amber = preservation, static = memory). Closure image is sharp, though one or two abstractions slightly blunt propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density: “sky a bruised purple,” “fears swam like sea monsters,” “light painting the room in hues of gold and violet.” Figurative language is coherent (light = knowledge/memory; sea = sacrifice/oblivion) and avoids purple excess. Minor scaffold in “heart aching… fragile, glowing structure” slightly softens propulsion, but no loops, synonym churn, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence earns its lyricism without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lyrical yet controlled; sentence openings vary (“Elian stood…”, “He placed…”, “His naivety made him…”). High information density: “crystalline structure catching first light” establishes setting, time, and magical texture in one phrase. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“tapestry of magic,” “plausible impossibility”) slightly softens propulsion. No loops or scaffold; closure beat (“first fish leaped”) lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure. High information density: “water-stained photograph,” “ghostly outlines,” “mirrored hush” do multiple jobs. But minor overwriting appears in climactic beats—e.g., “expunge the stigma of loss, allowing healing to flourish” uses therapy-adjacent phrasing that dulls emotional rawness. No loops or scaffold, but one register drift in the final paragraph slightly blunts closure’s punch.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: most lines advance character, theme, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“fused her analytical mind with her heartfelt instincts” / “perfect blend of reason and emotion”), and figurative density peaks near closure without pattern-teaching, risking mild overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong verbs and selective sensory detail. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “soundless echo” recurs three times with slight paraphrase, and “remembering through muscle memory” is stated twice verbatim—a loop that dulls propulsion. Sentence openings vary well, but the repeated phrasing around muscle memory triggers a −0.4 artifact deduction. Otherwise, high information density and clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient (“ghostly afterimages in the mind,” “numbness like a dam bursting”). Sentence variety supports rhythm, though a few high-pressure beats lean on figurative density (“psychic reverberations,” “energy lines converged”) without full payoff. No paraphrase loops, but “complementary opposites” appears as label before mechanics are shown, risking slight abstraction. Final image lands cleanly, avoiding scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is fluid and often evocative, but suffers from recurring abstraction (“possibility just born,” “flow of the game would mimic the natural flow”) and light paraphrase loops (e.g., “mystery seed mail had sparked a curiosity that now consumed her” followed by “curiosity... consumed her in the tranquil night”). Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph tightens rhythm effectively, though “sanctuary for creativity” verges on thematic summarization.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information-per-line (e.g., “his sighs into strings” conveys transformation economically). Sentence variety supports momentum, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, mild overwriting appears in beats like “melodies fractured by time and regret” followed by “half-remembered and achingly sincere”—a near-paraphrase loop. Not severe enough to dull closure, but prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density—e.g., “interiorized the exteriors” conveys method, emotion, and world logic. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual breath. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“waiting was the only action… It waited…”), and “dimensionally homesick” appears three times without evolution, creating slight loop friction. No scaffold or purple prose; metaphors cohere (light as parchment, mist as mirror).

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“smoldered,” “spiderwebbed,” “vivified”) and varied syntax. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “a warm, pulsing life, vivified by his will and the method of successive approximation” stacks modifiers and concepts. The phrase “the penny dropped” is cliché amid otherwise original diction. No fatal loops, but these artifacts prevent 9+ eligibility per Q7 guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwrought: “serenely electric” repeats as a motif yet borders on abstract label. Some redundancy appears in the final third (“silence is not empty, but full of potential” echoes earlier insights). Sentence openings vary well, but the closing paragraph contains near-paraphrase loops (“ending unfolds into a new dawn” / “beginning in every ending”). High information density falters slightly in the denouement, where thematic restatement slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: sentences multitask (e.g., “cracked casing a testament to years of salt and service” conveys history, texture, and character). Figurative language is controlled—starlight “drawing lines of silver” advances plot, not just decorates. Minor scaffold: “resiliently positive outlook anchored him” leans slightly toward label, though quickly grounded in action. No loops or cadence fatigue; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Deduction stems from one near-redundancy: “frayed edges of reality” followed by “scattered… across multiple realities” slightly overlaps conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Rhythm varies effectively (e.g., flowing description vs. staccato eruption). Minor overwriting in “colors bleeding and forms twisting violently”—“violently” slightly redundant given context. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent (thread = memory = connection). Final line (“embracing the unsettling calm”) resonates without flourish. Deduction for one instance of near-purple prose (“beautifully chaotic tapestry”), which slightly blurs the concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is precise and evocative: “domes carved from living coral,” “somber marvel,” “edges worn smooth by time.” Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. Minor overwriting in “tapestry of stars bloomed overhead”—slightly ornamental—but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; every line advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s cadence lands with earned lyricism, not purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative: “hazing the twilight into a muted, reeling hush” establishes tone economically. Sentences vary in length and structure, matching atmospheric shifts. Minor overwriting appears in stacked modifiers (“decades-old hearing aid,” “faint, ethereal light”), but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves cleanly, though “incidental hero of another silent war against oblivion” edges toward abstraction without undermining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though “crashing hush” appears four times, verging on motif overuse. Minor redundancy: “phase transitions” repeated without variation; “unremembered” used as both adjective and noun. Sentence openings vary well, but one paraphrase loop occurs (“walls shift… walls rippled”). No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; momentum holds. Closure image is clear, but figurative density slightly blurs physical logic of phase shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. Figurative language is purposeful (“milky, shifting luminescence,” “ephemeral patterns”) without muddle. One minor loop: “defragment the data” / “defragmented her history” borders on repetition but serves thematic echo. Closure beat is clean—no artifacts dull its impact. High information density throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line efficiency (“walls of pale, interlocking towers of bone,” “curse eating sound”). Figurative language is consistent (acoustic textures dominate) and payoff-driven—no purple excess. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the diamond description (“frozen lightning bolt” borders on cliché), but rhythm varies skillfully, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final lines land with earned simplicity, avoiding scaffold or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but largely purposeful: “gravitationally playful,” “frostbitten hope,” and “static-laden confessions” do thematic and atmospheric work. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, slight overwriting appears in the climax (“bodies softened, reshaping into beings of light and shadow”), where figurative density momentarily blurs causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one mixed metaphor (“poison that stained the soil” followed by “laughter” as antidote) weakens propulsion just before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is largely evocative and precise, with strong verbs (“uproot,” “seeping,” “quivered”) and varied sentence structure. Yet repetitive phrasing recurs: “resonantly soft” appears three times, “gap between knowing and understanding” twice, and “heart rhythms” four times—creating minor synonym loops. The closure beat avoids overwriting, but mid-story passages lean on stacked modifiers (“frozen music,” “mechanical will that had enslaved it”) that blur momentum. No fatal artifacts, but density occasionally outweighs propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is often evocative but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“broken promises heal,” “linking absences,” “fostered unity”) and conceptual redundancy across adjacent lines. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern payoff, creating density without propulsion. The final paragraph loops key phrases (“mail drop,” “healing,” “rebellion”) without deepening stakes or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“whispering gleam,” “misty hush”) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “ghosts of lions and dancers” slightly strains metaphor, but not enough to blur sense. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; sentence openings vary naturally. Final line (“reclaimed wonder”) resonates without sentimentality. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the story’s cadence—scrape of tools, chime of bells, rough song.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“analog memories… etched into the silk’s fragile threads”). Figurative language is coherent (geometry as language, stories as constellations) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent lines describing the scarf’s glow, slightly slowing momentum, but no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts impair clarity. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors earned peace.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “luminous absence,” “brushes of light tracing its form” do double duty. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light-as-pigment) and payoff-consistent. Minor overwriting in “complex patterns” slightly dilutes peak beat, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“tangible and real, before dissolving…”) breathes with earned resolution—zero artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “whispering possibilities,” “formless thought yearning to be born” verge on purple abstraction. Figurative density is high in peak beats without sufficient grounding—e.g., “secrets coiled like serpents” followed immediately by “chaos was the fear's last defense” creates slight metaphorical blur. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm, but synonym loops (“enveloped secrets” repeated four times) and label-heavy phrasing (“improbable longing”) reduce propulsion. Still, the final lines land with clean resonance, avoiding scaffold in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose avoids loops: each sentence advances plot or texture (“glass panels fractured and veiled in algae” establishes decay and visual motif). High information density—“broken constellations” conveys method, setting, and theme in three words. Minor overwriting in “shimmering haze rose... fragments flickered” slightly blurs cause/effect, but peak beats stay clear. Final line (“breathing in the recovered past”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “steel and silk in her voice,” “stems form a gate,” “crooked lines, the shadows we capture.” Sentences vary rhythmically, with paragraph cuts that heighten tension (e.g., post-creak retreats). Minor overwriting in “permanent slice of fading light”—slightly purple—but payoff justifies it. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final line (“shadows that taught you to stand tall”) resonantly echoes the opening without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is dense with figurative language—often beautiful, sometimes overwrought. Adjacent lines repeat concepts (“mend and beautify,” “preserve… ensure wonder never dulled”), creating paraphrase loops. Metaphors occasionally blur (“net of pure intention,” “weave of her own energy”) without clarifying mechanics. Final third suffers minor scaffold: “She resolved…”, “Her journey was…”, “And with that…” dilute momentum. High information density, but propulsion stalls in reflective summary.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but largely purposeful: figurative language (“woven quietude,” “tapestry of sorrows”) serves motif and mood without overwhelming causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“accumulation of silence made it hard to breathe” borders on label-speak), and one paraphrase loop exists (“lucid unrest” repeated without added pressure). Closure beat remains clear, but the density of metaphors in high-pressure moments slightly blurs immediacy—costing full top-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, though occasional overwriting appears (“rain-scoured fresco vault seemed to sigh”). No paraphrase loops, but minor figurative stacking in peak beats (“whispers of the past,” “woven threads of silence”) slightly blurs clarity. Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph cuts align with knowledge shifts. Final line earns resonance without scaffold, though “map of understanding” borders on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (threads, buoyancy, flakes) and pays off. One paraphrase loop: “untangling threads of corroded wiring and sodden rope” followed by “untangling these threads, both literal and metaphorical.” Final paragraph avoids scaffold, but “physics of letting go” repeats conceptually without new texture.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: phrases like “driftingly alert presence” and “tinkersong wonder” recur with slight variation, risking paraphrase loops. Figurative language appears in most high-pressure beats without sufficient payoff—e.g., “captured light” pigments don’t materially affect later action. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, minor scaffold remains: “encode action” is used twice abstractly rather than dramatized freshly each time.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“pierced,” “shuddered,” “unlocked”) and concrete nouns (“brass cage,” “leather-bound book”). Sentence openings diversify rhythm, and paragraphs shift length to mirror tension. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“warmly inquisitive anticipation,” “crisp focus”) edges toward label-speak, but figurative language remains coherent (light “scattered,” encryption “melting”). No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lush but suffers from repetitive phrasing: “quietly explosive” appears three times, “spooled wholeness” four, “dusty starlight” thrice—each functioning as a thematic anchor but bordering on scaffold-loop. Figurative density is high yet coherent, though lines like “memorializing each observation” verge on abstraction. Final paragraph tightens effectively, but mid-story cadence occasionally stalls in recursive description.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “fingers trailing over book spines,” “crushed to dust,” “static, beautiful lie” do double duty in atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is purposeful (“stolen a piece of the firmament”) without muddle. Minor redundancy in “fractally precise” appearing twice slightly dulls propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or purple prose obscure clarity. Final line (“learned to let it go”) resonates without sentimentality, closing the cadence cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally precise and evocative (“strands of luminance… glowing with an ethereal light that pulsed in rhythm”). However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “diligently curious spirit satisfied for now” verges on label-speak, and “sociable isolation” is repeated without deepening. No fatal loops, but “stranded luminance” borders on ornamental abstraction. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with summary (“double-checked her work”) instead of dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“hauntingly bright in their vivid, sorrowful clarity”). No paraphrase loops, yet two adjacent sentences near the climax repeat “rhythm of repair” conceptually. Sentence variety sustains momentum, and the final line resonates—but minor figurative stacking slightly dulls the closure beat’s sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “hope was a brambled thing” concretizes abstraction; “chime now a constant, low hum that vibrated through the stone” merges sound and tactility. Sentence variety supports momentum—no template cadence. Figurative language is controlled; metaphors (bell as inverted blossom, hope as vine) serve closure. One minor slip: “orchestrated by a guide they could never thank” borders on summary, but immediately redeemed by sensory return to the chiming bell.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: phrases like “across the hush of time’s final ripple” recur with slight variation, bordering on paraphrase-loop. Figurative language is consistent (light, silence, weaving) but appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats, risking saturation. Still, rhythm varies effectively, and key lines (“her voice became a bridge”) carry propulsion. Closure image remains sharp despite minor ornamental padding.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density (“gnarled trees bore fruit that shimmered with a malevolent light”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in “clumsy, desperate rescue set against the stark, majestic cliffs”—slightly abstract for peak beat—but quickly grounded by tactile follow-up. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lyrical yet precise, with high information density—e.g., “foam's ephemeral connections mirrored the bonds he had failed to strengthen.” Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “symphony of regret playing in his mind,” bordering on mixed metaphor. No loops or scaffold, but one near-paraphrase (“loosened grief” appears twice). Final third remains clear, though “dance of chemistry and physics” slightly abstracts.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten: metaphors stack (“frozen dew,” “blade of radiance,” “path of starlight”) without always advancing pressure. Some redundancy appears (“mindfully scattered” repeated; “quantified absence” invoked four times). Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. However, peak beats suffer slight figurative density—e.g., “incising words that quantified the absence of hope”—which borders on abstraction, dulling immediacy just enough to prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is lush but overwrought: adjacent sentences restate concepts (“subsume the core of the remorse… subsume was not to destroy”), creating paraphrase loops. Figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats without pattern payoff (“coral icebound pavilion shimmering with captured tears” → “icy bonds melting”), risking purple prose. The phrase “at the close of an unspoken dream” repeats verbatim three times—a scaffold artifact that dulls cadence and suggests AI templating.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“whirred,” “chimed,” “weaving”) and varied syntax. A few overwrought phrases (“vigorous tender sound,” “borrowed starlight”) edge toward abstraction. No paraphrase loops, but “silos” repeats functionally without evolution. Final paragraph’s momentum falters slightly with summary (“bridges were built…”) rather than pure image, dulling closure’s immediacy by 0.2–0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten: “entangled memories flowed through her, stories of love shattered by war…” stacks abstractions without concrete anchors. Minor paraphrase loops (“modify these psychic remnants… modifying not just her memories”) dilute momentum. Figurative density is high but coherent—mirror cracks, lunar rays, spectral hues form a consistent motif system. Final paragraph’s cadence falters slightly with repetitive structure (“a keeper… a beacon”), though not enough to obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is purposeful (“stone wreathed in perpetual mist,” “latent blaze”) and avoids purple excess. Minor redundancy in “threshold effects” phrasing across two paragraphs slightly dulls propulsion, but no scaffold loops or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves cleanly, echoing opening motifs without restatement.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, each sentence advancing atmosphere, character, or plot (“her fingers, tracing the bark… found not a song, but a long-forgotten sculpture”). Figurative language is purposeful—“cathedral of stillness,” “frozen score”—without muddle or overwriting. Minor deduction for slight repetition in “empathy in motion” phrasing (used three times), though each instance deepens context. Final paragraph’s lyricism earns its weight; no scaffold, no loops, no passive evasion.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“Kael stood…”, “His exile was…”, “Carefully, Kael laid out…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“images flooded his mind: the original signing…”) edges toward figurative density without muddle. No loops or scaffold; information multi-tasks (e.g., “dent… pulse in rhythm with his heartbeat” conveys emotion, object state, and time). Closure image remains sharp despite lyrical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is often vivid but suffers from figurative density in high-pressure beats: “silence of a shared grief,” “silence between heartbeats,” “silence before a storm” stack metaphor without variation. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“catalog the varieties of silence” echoed as “every silence held a story”). Final paragraph contains slight scaffold (“her journey was far from over… renewed commitment”), dulling propulsion. Still, sentence openings vary, and key images land cleanly—just short of 9+ due to overwriting in climactic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “basket of wood and vine, creaking gently with the wind's persistent whisper” establishes setting, sound, and mood). Figurative language is coherent—scents as “wet stone and ozone,” silence as “wildflower hush”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in “moment when collective understanding shifts like the ocean under a new moon” slightly dilutes momentum, but the final paragraph’s cadence (“breathed in the peace of motion”) earns its lyricism. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“curling,” “shimmered,” “unfurled”) and sensory layering (bio-luminescence, cold metal, gurgle of stream). Minor overwriting appears in “whirling silence” repetition and “dancing leaves” cliché, but figurative language serves atmosphere without muddle. Sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe with scene rhythm, and the final line elegantly echoes the opening. No loops or scaffolding mar momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with pacing. Minor artifact: “methodical survey, documenting wind patterns” slightly paraphrases “survey” stated earlier. One mixed metaphor: wind “whispering secrets” then “howling”—but both serve tonal shift. No scaffold loops; final lines avoid summary. Deduction only for slight overuse of “convergence” as conceptual anchor without deeper textual variation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush yet controlled, with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, figurative density occasionally borders on overwriting (“rainbow imprisoned and yearning for freedom,” “tapestry of emotions and hues”), risking slight muddle in peak beats. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines near climax restate “fusion of light and sound” conceptually, triggering a minor −0.2 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: most lines multitask (e.g., “air was avalanchingly quiet” conveys setting, mood, and thematic weight). Figurative language is coherent—silence “amplifies,” sound “unravels”—without mixed metaphors. Minor redundancy in “methodical… ritual of remembrance and learning,” but no loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Closure beat is clean, though “harvest of his insights” edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“a composite, a living graph of fractured sentiments”). Figurative language is consistent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors or purple excess. Minor deduction: “lucid turbulence” appears twice, verging on refrain-as-scaffold, but it’s thematically justified. Final paragraph’s cadence (“The stars were gone…”) resolves with perfect restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is evocative but occasionally over-embellished (“painting the rocky spine… in ethereal light,” “tapestry of shared insight”)—minor density issues in high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “germinate” appears three times with slight redundancy. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final lines avoid summary, resolving through image (“heart full of the wonder he had coaxed from the dark”). One mixed metaphor (“stretch moments like taffy” then “seed of understanding germinate”) slightly blurs coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“rose like trees,” “dangled,” “shatter”) and purposeful rhythm. Figurative language is dense but pattern-taught early (“shifted hush,” “crystalline forms”) and pays off in the closure. One paraphrase loop: “She had proven that objects absorb emotions, but in doing so, she uncovered her own buried feelings” echoes the prior sentence’s logic without added pressure. Final paragraph’s “assumptions shatter to make room for growth” risks slight sentimentality but is rescued by the concrete image of the clearing window.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“silence… chewing at the edges of the world like a moth through cloth”) and high information density. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and paragraphs cut purposefully. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “fragile bridge,” “tendrils of nothingness coiling” verge on stacked modifiers. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one mixed metaphor (“map of the raveling silence”) slightly blurs coherence. Closure image remains sharp despite minor figurative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is often evocative but suffers from recurring scaffold: “coax resilience from rubble” appears verbatim three times; “quietly determined” and “azure defiance” are restated rather than evolved. Template cadence emerges in hammer-strike passages (“He hammered on… deliberate act…”). Figurative density is high but coherent; however, synonym churn (“resilience,” “strength,” “enduring strength”) dilutes precision. Final paragraph loops without propulsion, dulling closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“starship skeletons loomed like behemoths,” “truth was like a shadow, always receding”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, accelerating during the rift sequence. Minor overwriting appears in “timeless, nebulous state where past and potential futures bled together”—slightly abstract for peak beats—but doesn’t obscure causality. Final lines land with clean propulsion: “the truth now a part of him, woven into the very map of his being” ties motif to closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency (“the air hummed with a luminescent ache”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths mirror pacing. Minor overwriting in “complex jewel” and “tangible sorrow” edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final lines resonate without redundancy, and the sea glass motif pays off with earned lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but suffers from repetitive phrasing: “through total internal reflection” appears four times verbatim, functioning as scaffold rather than pattern; “accidentally prophetic” and “shadowed elation” recur without evolution. Adjacent lines often paraphrase (“steer the beacon’s radiance… steer the light… steer the beam”), creating momentum drag. Figurative density is high but occasionally muddled (“inner fire” for cold quartz, “spear of emerald” then “conduit for stories”). Final third retains clarity, but the loops prevent high-band scoring despite strong individual lines.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful—“silent drum,” “quiet explosions,” “valley-mist wonder”—and coheres within a single metaphorical system (light/refraction/dye). Minor overwriting in “borrowed vitality” and “ethereal wonder” slightly dilutes otherwise precise diction. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve rhythm and revelation. Final line crystallizes motif without redundancy: the tea house drifts on, now charged with narrative potential.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely polished with strong rhythm and varied syntax, especially in atmospheric descriptions (“stones gleaming under the broken clouds”). However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “quantified sorrow that she had calculated over years of loneliness” uses therapy-adjacent phrasing that slightly dulls immediacy. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one instance of mixed register (“precise weight… silent corridors of her heart”) creates slight friction. Closure image remains clear despite these hairline slips.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: “soil rich with transmutative properties” implies world logic without exposition; “voice wrapping the light in layers of harmonious sound” merges action and metaphor cleanly. Sentence variety supports momentum—short clauses during crisis (“She began to sing”), flowing lines in reflection. One paraphrase loop: “weave the dawns again” / “recreate them” in adjacent sentences slightly dulls propulsion. No scaffold or mixed metaphors, but figurative density in the climax borders on ornamental without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally vivid and economical, but suffers from recurring conceptual redundancy: “nestled paradoxes,” “staying while leaving,” and “enlarged tranquility” are restated across adjacent lines without added pressure. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; however, phrases like “method of staying while leaving” verge on abstraction over concrete action. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Closure beat is clear, but slight overwriting in thematic phrasing dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “wax-paper-wrapped parcel,” “scarred by years and weather,” “cold, carved stone” all advance character and atmosphere. Sentence rhythms vary naturally, avoiding monotony. Minor overwriting in “heuristically gentle” (slightly academic for context), but quickly grounded in action. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; closure image (“gentle hands”) resonates without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense with imagery but avoids overwriting; most sentences advance atmosphere or action. Minor redundancy appears: “gently meticulous” repeats verbatim, and “illusions fade to memory” recurs without deepening. Figurative language is coherent (light = memory, ice = time), though “dying light” and “fading memory” border on cliché. Final paragraph achieves strong propulsion, but mid-story has slight momentum drag in descriptive passages that could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished with high information density—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence variety supports momentum, and figurative language is controlled (“whispered deals that clung to the shadows like moss”). However, minor overwriting appears: “comforting unease” repeats three times, verging on scaffold, and “visceral snap” slightly contradicts the earlier “delicate crackle,” muddling the central metaphor. No fatal artifacts, but slight redundancy prevents 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but purposeful; most figurative language serves atmosphere or theme (“aurora borealis shimmered above, a terrestrially cosmic bridge”). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“visible, swirling mist that dripped with cool moisture”) edges toward purple, but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. No loops or scaffold—each line advances knowledge, mood, or character. Final paragraph’s “calm, clear sky in her heart” lands cleanly without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information-per-line: “charcoal-fingered,” “prismatic shimmers,” “fractured versions of her resolve.” Figurative language is consistent—light, crystals, locks recur without muddle. Minor scaffold appears in “she felt… she remembered… she descended…” opening sequence, but quickly gives way to propulsion. One paraphrase loop: “rectify her artistic soul” and “rectified her path” echo redundantly. Closure image remains sharp despite slight lyric inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: most lines multitask (e.g., “leaves would curl and brown, as if recoiling from the falsehood” conveys rule, emotion, and consequence). Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“shimmered brighter; that moment of candor had stayed with her”), slightly blurring immediacy. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph avoids summary, closing with resonant action (“began the journey back”).

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled; figurative language serves propulsion (“wonder blooming back into existence”). Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“tapestry of sound that echoed across the bluff”), slightly diluting momentum. No loops or scaffold, though one paraphrase pair exists (“symphonies of truth… narratives of the world’s soul”). Closure beat remains clear and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-ornamented: “silent, brilliant flame erupted” borders on purple. Minor redundancy in “fragmented wholeness” appearing twice. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm breathes with scene needs. However, “strangely organic” repeats four times without deepening, triggering a −0.3 coherence penalty for motif overuse without evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery (“dawn light painting the courtyard in hues of gold and rose”), but overuses figurative language in high-pressure beats (“sandstorm calm,” “whispers of forgotten things”). A paraphrase loop appears: “sealed shut, much like the locked mailbox” followed by explicit comparison again. Sentence openings vary well, yet “she” begins five of six consecutive sentences during the investigation sequence, creating template cadence. No fatal artifacts, but density occasionally blurs propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten: metaphors like “spider spins its web” repeat without functional evolution, and phrases like “calm defiance solidify within her” verge on abstraction. Adjacent lines sometimes paraphrase (“liberated through code… encrypted vulnerability as strength”). Sentence openings vary well, but figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats without payoff (e.g., “dance intensified, becoming a narrative of resistance”). Final paragraph tightens effectively, though “mysterious familiarity” echoes without deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “gleaming silence,” “clumsy dance,” “charged poise” of floating mid-dig—all do double duty. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with tension. Minor overwriting in “leviathan of gleaming silence” risks purple prose, but it’s anchored by immediate action. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure beat (“flame a tiny, steady gravity”) is clear, resonant, and free of artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“terrestrially cosmic” x5, “smoothed hush” x4) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “flow of energy merged… creating symbiotic rhythm” followed by “flow of energy guided to serene conclusion”). Figurative density overwhelms propulsion in high-pressure beats, with stacked abstractions (“tranquil blaze,” “conceptual repricing”) dulling clarity. Final third contains scaffold sentences that summarize rather than dramatize closure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “light passed through him” conveys ghostliness economically; “iron bones and mortar veins” fuses anatomy and architecture. Figurative language is consistent (meteor = punctuation, building = speaker) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “masterpiece of mundane pretext,” but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence slows appropriately, letting the seal’s glow and dissolving form land with quiet propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often beautiful but over-ornamented: “tragically radiant” appears four times, and phrases like “ghostly resolve” repeat without evolution. Adjacent sentences sometimes paraphrase (“archive the memory… store it safely away”). The final paragraph suffers from stacked abstractions (“pain into purpose,” “unshackled future”) that dull the closure image. High figurative density in peak beats borders on purple prose, reducing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: “calibrated treason,” “pearl twilight,” and “wisely enduring” verge on label-speak. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without sufficient payoff cadence, risking purple prose. No paraphrase loops, but slight synonym churn (“unlinked,” “dissolve,” “sever”) dilutes precision. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters with repetitive closure gestures (“stepped into… ready to begin anew”), though rhythm largely supports emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and musical, but suffers minor overwriting: “progressive disclosure” appears three times with slight variation, bordering on paraphrase-loop. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent—“serpentine nexus,” “webs of intrigue” sustain the motif. However, in high-pressure beats (climax), stacked modifiers (“richly perceptive,” “reed-blown melancholy”) slightly blur immediacy. Final paragraph’s rhythm falters with repetitive structure (“He had… he had…”), dulling propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative (“sunken graves,” “blurred into abstraction”), with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Minor scaffold detected: “windows of connection” recurs with slight synonym churn (“thinnest here,” “opened,” “permanent window”). No loops or muddled metaphors, but one paraphrase pair (“salvage something pure… light against the shadows of oblivion”) edges redundancy. Closure beat remains unmarred—final lines propel cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is often beautiful but occasionally overwrought (“scintillatingly somber,” “demure audacity”)—elevated diction risks register drift in peak beats. Minor paraphrase loops exist (e.g., repeated emphasis on “hidden patterns” across adjacent lines). Still, rhythm varies, sentences propel, and the final paragraph lands cleanly without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean and propulsive, with high information density (“bruised sky,” “shredded letters,” “milky and cracked, yet it pulsed”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “excavate truth from the comfortable lies” appears twice, slightly dulling momentum. Figurative language is controlled—no purple prose—but “radioactive maelstrom” edges toward mixed metaphor (maelstrom = water, radiation = particulate). Closure beat remains clear despite minor artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is often lush but occasionally overwrought: “gritty whimsy of isolating storms and ethereal signals” stacks modifiers without grounding. Some paraphrase loops (“fragmented radio frequencies” repeated four times; “ancient shadows” three times) dull momentum. Final paragraph’s “storm had passed… heart full of quiet hope” risks sentimentality. Yet key lines (“The prophet rises not from a crown, but from a crackle”) sing with originality, and rhythm generally serves pressure—short sentences accelerate descent, longer ones linger in reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual cadence matching the ritualistic acts. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“choir of silenced voices,” “tapestry of peace”) borders on figurative density but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops, scaffold, or register drift—elevated diction stays within the poet’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Figurative density is high but often repetitive: “vibrational matching,” “sonic absolution,” and “logically emotional” recur without deepening. Mixed metaphors appear (“shadows that seemed to breathe with a fleshly ethereal presence” conflates tactile and spectral). Paraphrase loops occur: multiple lines restate the key’s purpose or Kaelen’s resolve. Final paragraph suffers scaffold bloat (“guarded by sound and soul… forever tied to the key”), dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is restrained yet potent (“sculpt patience from impatience,” “mirror to the infinite patience above”), avoiding purple excess. Sentence openings vary naturally, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. One minor flaw: slight paraphrase-loop in “patient revolution” repetitions (e.g., “quiet insurrection of the spirit” / “liberation not of force, but of alignment”), but it’s thematic reinforcement rather than scaffold. Closure image remains sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally vivid but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“through empirical observation” appears twice verbatim) and overuse of abstract compound nouns (“fortified vulnerability,” “entangled memories”). Figurative language is dense in high-pressure beats without payoff—e.g., “ghostly heartbeat,” “tapestry of resilience”—bordering on purple prose. Sentence variety is adequate, but filter verbs (“she felt,” “she noted”) dull immediacy in key moments. Final paragraph contains near-paraphrase loops about liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“dust motes danced in the beams slicing through the gloom like shards of hope”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“fleeting, inner fire”; “transmute regret into something tangible”) but doesn’t blur clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every paragraph advances pressure or atmosphere. Final chime lands cleanly, though “unfinished symphony” edges toward abstraction without undermining closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “archaeology of the soul, a joke played on time itself” compresses theme and tone. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“chaotic beauty,” “stubborn passion”) slightly dilutes peak beats, but no loops or scaffold. Final lines (“smiled at the boundless, foolish hope”) land with earned simplicity. One near-paraphrase (“steadily curious” repeated) costs 0.4, but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “ashes on the wind,” “melody of loss,” and “silence between the notes” resonate without overwriting. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor figurative density in the final paragraph (“void that could never be filled, only acknowledged”) slightly blurs immediacy, and “brightly attentive” borders on label-like repetition, costing 0.3–0.5 points from a potential 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is evocative and precise (“shadow-laced peacekeeper,” “ice groaning like a living beast”) with strong verbs and sensory specificity. Sentence variety supports momentum, and paragraphs shift purposefully between action, reflection, and description. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“calmly intuitive, not given to panic”)—a label that slightly dulls immediacy—but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure clarity. The closure image remains sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “wood groaning against the chill,” “fold in patience,” “windborne solace” do triple duty. Minor redundancy appears in repeated phrases like “gripped reality loosely” and “fold in patience,” slightly dulling momentum. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language remains coherent. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves cleanly, though “learned to listen, and in listening, she had found peace” borders on summary.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from overwriting: metaphors appear in nearly every sentence without pattern payoff, creating density without propulsion. Phrases like “passionate subtlety” and “gently persuasive clarity” feel like label-speak rather than embodied experience. Repetitive syntactic structures (“He remembered… He recalled… He saw…”) create template cadence. Final paragraph’s lyricism is strong, but mid-story loops dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic but suffers from paraphrase loops: “preserve the echo… safeguarding… anchor the wisdom… consecrate… vessel for echoes” repeats core ideas with near-synonym churn. Figurative language is consistent (echoes, lines, fields) but occasionally overused in high-pressure beats (“serpentine structure that curved protectively”). Sentence openings vary well, yet some passages summarize action (“he began by stilling his mind”) rather than dramatize. Closure image remains clear despite minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and mostly economical, with strong verbs (“climbed,” “swayed,” “enveloping”) and sensory specificity. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “transmute pain into a masterpiece, a visual symphony that would speak to the heart” stacks metaphors without payoff. Template cadence surfaces in “She noticed… She chose… She aimed…” early on. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, but “whispered secrets of a world reborn” leans toward purple prose, slightly dulling closure’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong but occasionally overwrought: phrases like “cathedral of forgotten knowledge” and “weathered innocence” verge on ornamental abstraction. Minor redundancy appears in descriptions of the hush and silence (“suspended hush filled the vast space… only she sought the living pulse within the static words”). However, most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or plot, and the final paragraph achieves clean propulsion. No fatal loops, but slight density in figurative language dilutes immediacy in mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery but avoids overwriting; most figurative language serves accumulation (“mist congealed into transient shapes,” “wrinkles forming and hopes fading”). Minor redundancy appears in adjacent lines (“clung to echoes… faint reverberations of time”) and slight synonym churn (“longing was tidal… rhythmic ache”). No scaffold loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Closure beat remains clear despite lyrical compression, though one or two near-duplicates slightly dilute propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied, with strong verbs (“cradled,” “whirred,” “seared”) and precise nouns (“astral camera,” “silver emulsion”). However, mild overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “luminous ache” repeats four times, and figurative density occasionally borders on purple (“radiant burst that seared into the film,” “dance with eternity”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences, but the closing paragraph’s cadence verges on incantatory repetition (“For in that sound… escape velocity achieved for the soul”), slightly dulling propulsion. Still, information density remains high, and every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information-per-line (e.g., “hymning the mundane” conveys method and theme). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“scent of hope,” “pulsing stillness”) and pays off at closure. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “fragile yet persistent fragrance” and “clouds shift like whispers” verge on purple prose. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent lines describe the vinyl’s role redundantly (“tangible piece… symbol of their bond”), costing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished, varied in rhythm, and dense with purpose—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Strong verbs (“etched,” “whirred,” “flickered”), specific nouns (“brass tool,” “circular mosaic”), and controlled figurative language avoid purple excess. One paraphrase loop: “quietly deliberate” appears three times, bordering on repetitive emphasis. Final paragraph’s “ready to relearn it all, one closed loop at a time” slightly echoes earlier phrasing but serves thematic resonance. No scaffold, no muddle—high information density with clear propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (cleft → chasm → constellation) and pays off without muddle. One paraphrase loop (“yearned… yearning sharpened”) and a trio of filter verbs (“she remembered,” “she recalled,” “she imagined”) in mid-text slightly dull immediacy, but peak beats remain clear. Final paragraph’s propulsion is flawless, with fireflies crystallizing the central metaphor without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled; figurative language appears frequently yet coherently (mist as “shroud,” light as “whisper”). Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor overwriting: “pearl of stillness” borders on label-only, and “zephyr bloom” repeats without deepening. No loops or scaffold, but density occasionally tips toward ornament in mid-story (“swirling mist of her thoughts”). Closure beat remains clear, preserving high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but largely disciplined—high information density, rhythmic variation, and strong verbs (“graft,” “proffer,” “carved”). Figurative language is consistent (organic/botanical motifs) and rarely muddled. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“cathedral of green,” “transient beauty”), but peak beats remain clear. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; closure image (“drip, each drop adding to the pattern”) earns its lyricism. One slight redundancy: “protected vulnerability” appears twice, once as label. Otherwise, line-level craft supports momentum and theme without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; however, adjacent lines sometimes paraphrase (“fleeting encounter” / “transient dreams”; “solemnized this hope” / “solemnize each encounter”). The phrase “lucidly watchful” appears twice as a label without embodied demonstration. Final third avoids major artifacts, but minor synonym churn (“hope,” “aspiration,” “dream”) and template cadence in cameo descriptions reduce propulsion. Still, rhythm varies sufficiently, and key images land with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: “golden stories unfolded in the air, weaving tales…” risks abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“restored what was lost” / “revived a legacy”) and some stacked modifiers (“verdant arbor at dawn was once again a sanctuary”). However, information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme—and rhythm supports the accumulative arc. Closure beat avoids artifacts, though mid-story figurative density slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “gnarled apple trees... stood like sentinels” conveys setting, mood, and metaphor). Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths mirror ritual pacing. Minor overwriting in two adjacent lines (“patterns growing more complex... symphony of silent vibrations”) edges toward paraphrase-loop, but clarity at closure remains uncompromised. No scaffold or artifact penalties apply.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Figurative language (“wounded season,” “cellar of reason”) is consistent and integrated. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “threads of mystery into the fabric of understanding,” but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Final paragraph’s cadence deepens resonance without redundancy. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery (“starlight filtering through cracks like benedictions”) and high information yield per sentence. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “boundary-lessly trapped” and “whalebone reverie” risk abstraction, though context grounds them. One paraphrase loop: “orient properly” repeats mechanically across four burdens, slightly dulling propulsion. Final third avoids artifacts; closure image (“weights… lifting her up”) is clear and resonant. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support accumulation without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and strong verbs (“carve sense into her loss”). Minor overwriting appears in mid-story figurative clusters (“crystallized time,” “rust-hued peace”) that slightly blur immediacy. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “hauntingly practical” recurs as label without fresh embodiment. Closure beat remains sharp, though one mixed metaphor (“harvest lessons from loss”) risks abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“lights dimmed to a memory,” “cloud-like ground”), though occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“kinetic energy pulsed in waves, stirring the air with a low hum”). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional rhythm. A minor paraphrase loop occurs in describing ambitions as “eroded” three times across 150 words. Despite this, information density remains high, and the final lines (“stillness was no longer fractured, but complete”) resolve with clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“packed up,” “ignited,” “hummed”) and selective sensory detail. Sentences advance multiple aims: “He rerouted dormant water pipes to feed a dormant hydroponic garden” conveys action, setting, and theme. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “symphony of renewal, echoing the sextant's ancient role” risks mixed metaphor. No paraphrase loops, but “maze of intentions” repeats without deepening, slightly dulling its impact. Final line lands cleanly, recharging “redirected flows.”

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “excruciatingly gentle” appears four times, risking scaffold-loop (−0.4). Figurative density is high yet mostly coherent—petrichor as “sweet, lasting perfume of remembrance” works, but “spectral echo of past conversations” verges on abstraction. Sentence variety sustains momentum, though two adjacent lines restate her dream (“composing symphonies... filling grand halls”). Closure beat avoids artifacts, preserving emotional clarity despite minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and evocative, but suffers from mild overwriting: “serene upheaval,” “thoughtfully clear,” and “training instincts” recur as near-synonym loops. The phrase “architecture of lies” appears four times—functional but bordering on scaffold. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. However, the density of figurative language in the climax (“sundial felt alive,” “whispers of history”) slightly blurs immediacy without payoff, preventing 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “eyes that held the deep stillness of ancient forests” conveys character, setting, and theme). Minor overwriting in “oceanic hush” repeated twice, and “infinite patience” edges toward label-speak, but never derails momentum. No loops, scaffold, or simultaneity errors. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves with visual and auditory closure (“glow,” “vow,” “fog rolled on”). Figurative language is coherent—lightning-born glass, mist-weavers—without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional figurative stacking (“leaves fell like forgotten memories,” “skeletal trees cast long shadows”) risks slight overwriting in early beats. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and every line advances atmosphere or character. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; the final paragraph’s cadence perfectly echoes the opening, creating resonant closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional figurative stacking (“dripped with the memory of water,” “cold precision, devoid of beauty”) risks slight overwriting. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony; rhythm varies effectively. Information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. A minor artifact: “hypothesized about everything” repeats verbatim three times, creating a faint scaffold loop that slightly dulls momentum in mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “obsidian lagoon lay still beneath the dunes, its surface a dark mirror reflecting the migration of clouds”). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “gracefully alert poise” and “kelp-drift peace” verge on stacked modifiers. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near climax (“pain could transform into beauty” echoes “scars could sing”). Rhythm supports emotional arc without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and paragraph cuts serve momentum. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“defiant hush,” “sidereal patience”) borders on label-like abstraction but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (light/water/memory). Final image (“water began to trickle”) earns its quiet power without flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled—“petals of light,” “cosmic dust”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“generational patterns of calculation and care”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Final lines achieve propulsion through variation: “The sonar pinged on…” resolves with rhythmic inevitability. No artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “thundering calm” conveys paradoxical atmosphere and inner state). Sentence variety supports rhythm, though occasional figurative stacking (“fleeting orange and black,” “heat haze,” “cathedral for introspection”) borders on ornamental in mid-text. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “woven” appears four times in final third—minor repetition that doesn’t obscure clarity. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves cleanly, recharging earlier motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density (“brass gears and weights his sole companions”). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths shift with emotional tempo. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “searing reverie had burned away the dross of his past, leaving purity” risks abstraction. Also, “incremental absolution” repeats four times—functional as motif but borders on scaffold. No loops or causality-obscuring artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“threads pulsed with hidden stories”) is consistent and grounded. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats—“uncharted echoes were no longer silent; they resonated through the decoded tapestry”—where abstraction slightly dulls immediacy. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “velveteen gloom” repeats verbatim three times, verging on motif redundancy. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence, though the final paragraph’s uplift leans slightly declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density—e.g., “ink made from crushed obsidian, symbolizing the clarity he aimed to bring” conveys action, symbolism, and character intent in one clause. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent sentences describing predictive modeling (“chart courses through the fog… mapping the voids”), risking paraphrase-loop, but momentum holds. Final paragraph avoids scaffold, closing with kinetic resonance: “waters stirring with new life.”

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “teach dust to tell stories” compresses motive, method, and metaphor). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting appears in “stubbornly resilient” and “half-remembered lore,” but no loops or scaffold dilute momentum. Figurative language is consistent (light/dark, growth/resilience), though “thistled calm” borders on coined abstraction—still, it pays off thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (mirage, crystallize, powder) without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“resin of regret and hope”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure beat remains sharp. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Final line (“silence felt like a beginning”) resolves with resonant economy.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“agonized over… agonized not just…”), near-synonym loops (“doubt and determination,” “doubt” again), and stacked abstractions (“whirlpool of doubt and determination,” “grinding pressure”). The final paragraph avoids overwriting, but mid-story lines like “rational rebellion was not born of anger but of a deep-seated need” drift into diagnostic label-speak. Sentence openings vary adequately, though cadence occasionally flattens during reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and theme (“soft as a forgotten lullaby”). Rhythm varies naturally, though occasional figurative stacking (“crimson leaves tapped… soft percussion”) borders on density without pattern-teaching. No loops or scaffold; closure beat (“warm light persisted”) avoids artifacts. Minor deduction: “braid diverse voices” recurs slightly mechanically, but not enough to obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lush but suffers from paraphrase loops: “prune away the dead… prune another dead branch… snipping away withered leaves” repeats the same action with synonym churn. Figurative density is high in every sentence of the climax (“silvery radiance,” “pulse with energy,” “whispers of ancient gardens”), creating slight muddle. Final paragraph compresses momentum with redundant affirmations (“created something beautiful… one memory at a time”).

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“stumbled,” “thrums,” “weaves”) and varied syntax. However, late paragraphs exhibit paraphrase loops: “The drone beehive failure was a memory now, but the wonder remained…” followed by near-redundant reflections on routine, wonder, and tomorrow’s magic. These scaffolded echoes dull momentum in the final third. Figurative language is coherent (“lightning tower stood silent, a sentinel”), but density peaks too early, leaving closure slightly over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“cherry blossoms scattering like pink snow,” “hushed blaze”) is coherent and recurring. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“a shard of hush descended, not as an absence of sound, but as a presence”), slightly slowing propulsion. No loops or scaffold, but one adjacent paraphrase (“tangible quiet that wrapped… like a cloak” / “warmth emanate from the walls”) nudges score down from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose maintains high information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (e.g., “kelp swaying as if breathing” conveys animate lifelessness while grounding setting). Figurative language is coherent—water, weaving, and light motifs interlace without contradiction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“After the secret…”, “Its mind…”, “Before it…”). Slight overwriting in “cascading revelations intensified” risks abstraction, but closure beat (“animate in its lifeless form”) remains clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically (long clauses for proofs, staccato for rupture). Information multi-tasks—e.g., “chipped die wobbling, a five” conveys action, sound, and plot input. Minor overwriting in “mathematical symbols glowed... manifesting from her mind” slightly muddles causality, but closure remains sharp. No loops or scaffold; every line advances character, stakes, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“She was methodically hopeful…”, “Inside the glass-paned sanctuary…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“moonlight responded, weaving daydreams sparked by its beams”) risks figurative density, but coherence holds. No loops or scaffold; final line (“forever hopeful under the waxing moon”) resonantly echoes the opening without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency (“rosewater dread perfumed the air, the cloying sweetness of memory layered over a deep, existential fear of loss”). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—no mixed metaphors or purple excess. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and key images (lens, bread, honey) recur with evolving weight. One minor redundancy: “faded ink momentarily legible” slightly overlaps with “soften the edges of time,” but not enough to dull closure. Final image lands with clarity and emotional propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “the slow exhale of low tide,” “latent radiance… pulsed like a slow heartbeat.” Figurative language is pattern-taught and payoff-integrated. Minor overwriting in the climax (“whirring cacophony of reversed time”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops or scaffold. Final lines land with rhythmic clarity and earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “paint peeling like sunburnt skin” establishes tone economically. Figurative language is purposeful, not stacked—each metaphor serves atmosphere or character. Minor redundancy in “repulsive allure” appearing three times, but final use reweights it (“fading behind her, just a memory”), so lyric resonance offsets repetition. Sentence rhythm varies effectively; no scaffold or loops in climax.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “fractal generating method” concretizes magic without over-explaining; “restless euphony” crystallizes tone. Minor overwriting in “fragile, luminous dome” risks purple prose but pays off in closure’s “indigo expanse.” No loops or scaffold—every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“work was never done… sea would always provide”) earns its lyricism through accumulated tension.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “sunwashed dread” does atmospheric, emotional, and thematic work in three words. Sentences vary rhythmically, with strong verbs (“snaked,” “drifted,” “sealed”) and concrete nouns. One minor slip: “quietly driven purpose, his ambition a silent engine” edges toward mixed metaphor (purpose/engine), but clarity holds. No loops, scaffolds, or filter-verb stacks; every line advances character, setting, or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though slightly over-figurative (“green shroud,” “silent scream”). Minor redundancy in describing the letter’s importance twice. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports mood. However, phrases like “emotionally rational mind cataloging the decay” edge toward label-speak, and “pit of lies” verges on cliché—small blemishes that prevent 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “granite hiding… silt” conveys contradiction economically). Figurative language is coherent: water motifs (silt, drowning, ripples) never contradict physical logic. Minor overwriting in “aqueous twilight” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence (“carrying the weight of silent stories”) earns its lyricism through prior concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “dappled resolve” conveys doubt and persistence in two words). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create breath. Minor overwriting in “abyssal hush” and “profound reclaimed stillness” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent (light-through-water metaphor sustained), and the final line’s “secrets softly exhaled” resonates without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and high information-per-line, though minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“brilliant, painful clarity that seared her soul”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but figurative density occasionally risks muddle (e.g., “descends while ascending” repeated without deepening). Sentence variety supports rhythm; final line (“luminous memory of love enduring beyond loss”) recharges motifs cleanly. One near-redundant clause (“fleeting peace… agony”) slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line efficiency. Metaphors are consistent (ghost, reservoir, fabric) and avoid purple excess. Minor scaffold appears in “a river of light and numbers” and “archive of loss,” slightly generic amid otherwise sharp imagery. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and the final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes the thematic turn without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but generally controlled, with high information density in early beats (“domes etched in the brilliant dimness of dusk”). However, the final third accumulates figurative repetition: “brilliant dimness” recurs three times, “star trails” four, and phrases like “woven into the fabric” verge on stock cosmic metaphor. A paraphrase loop appears in lines about belonging (“found what was always there” / “belonging is not found, but built”). These artifacts don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+ eligibility per Q7 guardrails. Momentum holds, but lyric excess slightly dulls the climax’s precision.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence openings vary (“Elara stood…”, “She clutched…”, “For years…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Figurative language (“prison of her own making,” “sieved hush”) is consistent and payoff-ready. Deduction for slight overwriting in peak beats: “core of tempered regret” and “palpable force that stole her breath” edge toward abstraction, though swiftly anchored by physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is evocative with strong sensory layering (“mist clinging like a shroud,” “wind howled across the stone”). Sentence variety supports rhythm, though occasional overwriting appears (“furrowed hush that seemed to hold its breath”). No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent lines near the end (“She had untethered not just the prisoners, but her own spirit…”) verge on restatement. Closure image remains sharp despite slight density in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is often evocative, but suffers from repetitive phrasing: “backlash of regrets” appears three times nearly verbatim; “faith flickered” twice; “merrily melancholic” four times. These are not taught patterns but scaffold loops that dull momentum, especially in the final third. Sentence openings vary adequately, but the density of figurative language in high-pressure beats (“storm in his mind,” “dying flame”) occasionally blurs clarity. Still, key lines land with force (“He didn’t need the stars; he had the earth-bound guides, and that was enough”).

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“ghost of his dirty past clung… like a stubborn stain”; “delicately robust” repeated). Sentence variety supports momentum, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“seeker now, hunting for a fresh start” / “he was a seeker, forever changed”), creating slight scaffold drag. Closure remains unharmed, but density dips in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but disciplined; figurative language serves atmosphere without muddling causality. Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “cosmic intimacy of the moment washed over her; she felt the universe as a close, breathing entity” edges toward abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines (“The orchard bloomed on… thrived”) verge on paraphrase, slightly dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “onyx-ink cartomancer” conveys profession and aesthetic in three words. Figurative language is purposeful (“drowning in stars,” “choking beauty”) without muddle. Minor redundancy in “unfastening... unfastened” (lines 12/18) slightly dulls propulsion, but no scaffold loops or register drift. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resolution—clean, resonant, inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “stitch the fractured light” does triple duty (action, metaphor, theme). Figurative language is pattern-taught (shimmer → blaze → tapestry) and pays off in the climax. One paraphrase loop: “weave the shimmering trails into a coherent whole” followed by “weaving a tapestry” slightly redundantly. Final paragraph’s “ghostly resolve” echoes the opening but sharpens meaning—no scaffold, though “compassionate light” borders on label-speak. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled; metaphors (“evaporated like morning dew”) serve theme without muddle. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“vibrant, pulsing with the volcano's breath”) edges toward density, but never obscures causality. Final lines avoid scaffold—each advances resonance (“guided by starlight, forever changed and forever changing”).

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is vivid but over-reliant on figurative density: “cradle of sparks,” “winking hush,” “pregnant pause,” “canvas for her invention” recur with near-synonym churn. Adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“The intrigue was unfolding perfectly… a delicate dance of secrecy”; “The silent revolution was sparking… one hidden leaflet at a time”). Final third suffers from cadence loops (“Elara’s calmly inventive…”, “The bronze quill holder…”, “The half-painted sundial…”) that dull propulsion. Still, strong verbs and concrete nouns anchor key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “twisted like eels in a net,” “beam of borrowed dawn,” “sparks flowed into the rock sequences.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (aurora = borrowed dawn) and pays off. Minor overwriting in “constellation of sparks” slightly dilutes clarity, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts serve rhythm, and the final line (“everything made sense”) crystallizes without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “glass dome trembled with each thunderclap” conveys setting, sound, tension). Figurative language is pattern-taught (storm = turmoil, scars = maps) and pays off. Minor overwriting in “cartography of scars” repeated thrice; slight synonym churn (“vigil was in pause” → “vigil was no longer in pause”). Final paragraph verges on summary but avoids fatal loops. Read-aloud rhythm remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“prismatic shards,” “dignified chaos”) but occasionally overwrites—e.g., “geometric sonata waiting to be played” risks mixed metaphor. Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Minor redundancy in describing the needle card’s purpose twice. No scaffold loops, but one near-paraphrase: “turn questions into destinations” appears as both motivation and closing refrain without deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, with shorter phrases during action (“They worked in companionable silence”) and lyrical flow in reflection. High information density: “molts personalities monthly” conveys complex psychology economically. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“luminous fracture in the city’s dark fabric”) edges toward abstraction, slightly dulling immediacy. No loops or scaffold; every image serves atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “sky bled from silver to deep orange” conveys time, mood, and threat. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light motifs recur in flora, projector, path) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “strategically creative” label slightly flattens, but compensated by immediate demonstration. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve momentum. Closure beat (“peace he had carved”) avoids purple prose, landing with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: “cultural memory was now secure… memory was safe… memory would endure… memory was safe” (repeated 5+ times). Adjacent sentences restate identical ideas (“The fantasy island's magic was sustained… its stories intact”; “Elara had fulfilled her motivation… ensuring the cultural memory would endure”). Final third drowns in redundant affirmations, dulling momentum and closure impact. High figurative density lacks payoff, violating the read-aloud ear test with drumbeat cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is evocative and generally precise, though occasional overwriting appears (“regrets pooling like cerulean waters,” “tarnished with age, its needle quivering as if sensing unseen currents”). Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. However, “diffuse your intentions, to spread them out like mist so they do not obstruct the path” verges on explanatory abstraction, and “color of unspoken apologies” risks label-speak. No fatal loops, but density dips slightly in mid-section exposition.
