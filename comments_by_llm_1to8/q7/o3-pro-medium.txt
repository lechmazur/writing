  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("mud sucking at their boots in wet applause"), but several overwritten metaphors strain clarity ("silence folded over the property like a breathable tarp"). Template cadence appears in mid-section ("She realized... She told Jonah... She would later feed..."). Information density adequate but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "frost unfurled across the ledger like lace woven by invisible spiders." Information density is good, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for the redundant opening line, occasional overwriting in high-pressure beats, and some filter-verb clustering ("she felt," "she noticed").

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The ocean that had swallowed my crew stood frozen beside the glasshouse, a black wall embalmed by perpetual polar auroras"). Some elevated diction in peak moments ("mathematicians who believed geometry could coax orchids") slightly strains the POV but doesn't obscure clarity. Strong syntactic variety and zero loops.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears: "soaked twine," "chased stillness," "smeared under the glass like drowned constellations." The metaphor density in high-pressure beats ("singed wick willingly drowning itself") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies. Information density is strong with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose density serves the accumulative mode well—"Sanctions had severed trade routes, medicines, stories, and names, but hunger stayed, gnawing politely at doors." Some filter-verb clustering ("We understood," "We hurried") slightly dulls immediacy but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, but several instances of overwriting: "corridor of lanterns floating in his chest," "pilgrim of sparks," and abstract phrases like "the echo admit it has always been a voice." Some template phrasing appears ("Soon," "Now," transitions). Information density is moderate; several passages could be tightened without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The bridge bent over an abyss of mist, yet living vines sprouted along its curve, forming corridors"). Some elevated diction ("retrocognitively trapped," "Euclidean logic") fits the premise, though occasional abstraction ("texture of time itself") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong verbs. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing plot or atmosphere. Some overwriting appears ("constellations trapped under glass," "envoy of germinating tomorrows") and the phrase "staggering grace" repeats, creating mild redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("thin stem snapping beneath unexpected weight") but suffers from abstract phrases ("battered marvel," "paradoxical bloom"). Some redundancy in describing the forge's process. Line "While cells divide unseen within his own trembling hands" feels inserted rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong density with lines doing multiple jobs, though some figurative density borders on excess ("frosting the air with silver promise that felt almost too bright to touch"). Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "she [verb]" constructions. Information propels consistently without major loops.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and strong imagery. Some overwriting appears ("noble plugging of cords," "heroic priming of pilot lights") though it's partially justified by character voice. Minor redundancies in thematic statements and occasional abstract phrasing ("weighty lightness") create slight drag.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and concrete action, particularly in discovery and jump sequences. Some metaphorical excess ("seashell telling me so," "galaxies") and occasional abstract phrasing ("identity could be edited again") create minor drag. The final image lands cleanly with "walked toward whatever name I would answer to next."

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rich textural density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Wind clawed across the storm-tossed ridge fort, rattling shutters like teeth in a goblet"). Some figurative density borders on excess ("gold flakes lifted like moths, circling the brazier before dissolving into luminous dust") but serves the accumulative design. Minor momentum drag in middle exposition about the fort's history.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong opening "twilight slid down the academy walls like a slow sigh" and varied sentence structures maintain momentum. Information density is high—most lines advance multiple story elements. Some abstract passages ("where patterns overlap, neither purely mechanical nor purely mystical") and occasional filter constructions ("He registered," "He recognized") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of beauty ("dripping gutters that rang like distant bells") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff. Abstract phrases like "transparency poured through light" and "spreading resonant hush across rooftops" create opacity. Some template structures appear ("So he set," "So he slipped," "There he found") and the final third relies heavily on telling rather than showing the community transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong imagery and rhythm in key passages, particularly the opening and transformation sequence. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("commemorating small victories elaborately," "hitherto uncharted register") and slight overwriting in metaphorical density during the climax that obscures immediate clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("incandescent," "magnosaurs") that slightly strains the POV's established register, though the overall clarity and momentum remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with evocative imagery and good momentum. However, some overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("drowned cathedral," "spectral inkblots," "audience of shadows") and occasional abstract phrasing ("soggy resolve," "unpredictable acoustics"). The filter verb "felt" appears too frequently in emotional beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.0)
    Information-dense prose with strong rhythmic control, though occasional overwriting appears ("auroral sorrow," "ossify doubt"). Some metaphor density in high-pressure beats without full payoff. Line "barometers clicked like counting insects" exemplifies effective sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally strong prose with high information density—lines like "The brass beads threaded around its rim glimmered in flashlight glare, a rosary for machinery" do multiple jobs. Some figurative excess appears ("coal dust refusing to settle," "incense-sweet nonsense") but doesn't obscure clarity. Minor template cadence in the radio caller section ("one caller had hissed...another sobbed") costs precision.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("walls of glass parted like curtains surrendering a stage"). Some overwriting in metaphor density ("startled pigeons," "molting serpent," "caged heart" clustered too tightly). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("Some replicas wept, some laughed, some carried") but serves intentional mirror-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm that matches the ceremonial pacing. Information density is moderate - most lines advance atmosphere or ritual progression. Minor overwriting appears in metaphor density ("like faded cables whispering of underground rivers") but doesn't obscure clarity. The opening and closing lines effectively frame the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("rose like a brushed bronze pillar" = setting/atmosphere/theme). Some mild elevation in abstract passages ("moral centers tilting realms") but propulsion remains strong through concrete action-verbs and varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for abstract phrasing loops ("accidentally prophetic" appears twice identically), some filter constructions ("I realized," "I felt"), and occasional purple patches ("moonlight wrung through glass").

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the layered description of rhetorical devices becoming architecture. Some figurative density in peak beats ("spidered across the creature's borrowed confidence") but serves the accumulative pattern. Clear propulsion through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "Snow began to fall, each flake catching the aurora...stamping it with prismatic applause" combines weather, time, and thematic resonance). Some elevated diction ("chronologically homesick," "bewildering symmetry") occasionally strains but remains within artistic voice. Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph lengths.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery, but several instances of abstract density that slow momentum: "periodically eternal, a being who cycles not through days but through recognitions." Some paraphrase loops around the concept of choice multiplication. The closing lines achieve strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density varies—strong in sensory moments but diluted by abstract phrases and near-loops ("emotional numbness"/"defeat emotional numbness," "audibly muted" used 4x). Several elevated metaphors strain clarity ("filament of hush coiled," "starlight chipped from midnight glass"). The "Seek/play/follow" sequence and drum-tuning section maintain momentum. Template cadence appears in the middle catalog of actions ("She fitted...She reversed..."). Figurative density in peak beats without clear payoff triggers deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for scattered overwriting ("symphony of mutual survival"), some template phrasing ("She hesitated, recalling..."), and occasional register drift. No major artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("molten opal," "translucent arches") and some template phrasing ("Together they stepped," "Instantly he stood"). The filter verb "he believed" and abstract moments like "grief kept love from vanishing" dull immediacy in places.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, as "The rope dangled from his satchel like an unfinished question mark" establishes object, character, and tone simultaneously. Some abstract phrasing ("gorgeously frayed perimeter where choice becomes song") borders on purple prose but maintains coherence. The piece avoids loops and scaffolding, though occasional elevated register ("accidental constellations between his knees") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Air bubbles escaped the bark and blossomed into faint, glassy whistles" combines action, transformation, and acoustic detail. Some figurative density in descriptive passages ("magnificent simplicity," "chronic hush") but these establish pattern early. Strong syntactic variety maintains momentum through the water-slowed action.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves high density with lines like "secrecy breathes more freely among relics" doing multiple jobs. Strong syntactic variety and controlled metaphorical language throughout. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("distraction is a safer cousin of comfort") and the slightly mechanical "lunar cycle" exposition that could be more organically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose flows smoothly but suffers from abstract phrasing ("cautious exuberance" appears twice, "cycles of compassion turning another quiet revolution"). Some metaphors strain credibility ("stars trembled above as if eavesdropping"). The writing favors conceptual summary over concrete imagery, particularly in emotional beats that would benefit from embodied detail.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong imagistic precision in "bottled rain" and "teaspoons against porcelain crystal." Information density high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. However, several abstract formulations weaken immediacy ("boldly sympathetic," "orphaned by history"), and some paraphrase loops appear ("felt threaded, dedicated, alive" follows similar "grafted onto the widening community").

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong imagistic density in "rooftops rose like overlapping shelves" and "silver threads weaving between towers," with varied sentence rhythms matching scene pressure. Several abstract constructions slow momentum ("she sculpts time itself with strokes most cannot even name," "time wore no skin there") and the phrase "interrupted cadence" appears four times without sufficient variation.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The fruit pulsed quietly, like pocket hearths" establishes setting, atmosphere, and emotional state simultaneously. Some abstract passages ("ambiguous loss lacked resolution") could be more embodied. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm support the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong images like "copper mains glimmered and ducts dripped condensation like slow clocks." Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing ("kindly methodical," "stitched from threadbare nights") and occasional overwriting ("rivers of moonlight") but no loops or scaffolding that harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high with vivid sensory work ("Drops drummed a soft rhythm on plastic pots"). However, abstract declarations ("curiosity overtook fear," "reluctance now seemed as misplaced") and some overwritten metaphors ("slate clouds gliding like cautious manta rays") reduce immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with vivid compression: "canvas devouring visions," "fireflies of regret." Some figurative density in peak moments ("living chiaroscuro of longing") and occasional template structures ("She realized... so she began") prevent higher scoring. Information density remains high throughout with minimal scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Deductions for scattered overwriting ("steadily unpredictable" appears twice; "overlapping shadows" repeats) and occasional purple moments ("whispers of aborted chords"). Information density is high but some metaphors strain.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong prose control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm that mirrors the story's themes of interval and pause. Information density is high - most sentences carry multiple functions. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("possibility hummed at each junction") and one instance of telling over showing ("Such rhythm would hearten the city").

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density high in descriptive passages. However, several instances of elevated register drift ("trembling certainty tingled," "conspiratorial breadcrumb trail") and some filter-verb clustering in middle sections. Template cadence appears briefly ("She knelt...She followed"). No artifacts touch the closure, preserving its power.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm shifts between contemplative and active moments. Some repetitive phrasing ("entangled memories" appears multiple times without variation) and occasional overwriting ("moon plating its back like armor"). Information density is good - most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose density serves the accumulative mode with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional abstraction dulls immediacy ("everything felt rephrased, like a poem whispered through thunderclaps then recopied by candlelight"). Some metaphor strain appears but doesn't obscure closure; rhythm control strengthens in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose suffers from overwriting in places ("twitching like an unreleased theorem," "pulse scrawled proofs"). Strong moments like "waiting actively like water eroding stone" balance weaker metaphors. Information density generally high, though some philosophical abstractions slow momentum. Template phrases appear ("minutes passed heavy with").

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Birds dared only half-throated murmurs" establishes atmosphere while foreshadowing silence. Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("thunder butterflies," "fretted like bark gnawed by patient winds") but serves the accumulative texture. Clean prose mechanics with varied syntax supporting the meditative pace.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments like "cranes, a towering labyrinth of shipping containers rose like stacked dusk-coloured tombstones" show controlled imagery. Some abstract passages ("texture of memories," "layer what fragments I gather") create minor opacity. The final third maintains momentum despite philosophical density.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high without feeling cluttered. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("ephemeral compass," "resonant reconfiguration") but mostly serves the literary tone. The metaphorical language enriches rather than obscures, though "pirouetted" feels slightly precious.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structures and effective information density. Some figurative excess appears mid-story ("tuning forks for revolution," "virginal white to suspicious violet") without clear payoff. Minor template cadence in the legal preparation sequence ("Each night... each dawn") though it arguably serves accumulative patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("dawnlit melancholy colored the sky"). Information density varies—some passages achieve multiple purposes while others feel slightly padded. Occasional overwriting appears ("purposefully curious" used twice, some adjective stacking). The final image powerfully synthesizes concrete and abstract without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves strong sensory specificity ("milk blue and serenely steady," "brass feathers chipped") with varied sentence rhythms matching scene tempo. Deductions for repetitive "Mara [verb]" constructions across 4-5 lines and occasional overwriting ("magnetic calm anchored in her chest"). Information density high in diagnostic sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Steam hissed behind him, yet the surrounding hush pressed closer"). Information density is high and sentences effectively vary. Deductions for abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy ("carrying no artifacts but bearing every river's first syllable"), some filter constructions ("Morrow felt ridiculous"), and elevated diction in places ("polyglot's phrasebook dog-ear," "feathery lacunae") that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("lamp posts flared, illuminating murals Lira had seen only in brittle sketches"). Some minor metaphor density in places ("doors hung like spent tongues") but the prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty—"columns of light, brushing her visor and triggering neural implants"—but suffers from overwriting in places. "Star-diver Mara drifted through cobalt gloom" and similar constructions lean purple. The phrase "lonesome splendor" appears twice, and abstract descriptors like "mythic depths" could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptive passages. Some abstract constructions weaken propulsion ("sensing a tremor of silence not absence but presence"). Minor figurative muddle appears in "chains dangled like broken harp strings" when chains later "rearrange themselves into harmless loops." Generally clean grammar and varied syntax support the literary tone.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("Glass panes dripped black condensation") and good rhythm variation. However, several instances of abstract labeling ("mournful elation," "lovingly venomous" repeated), some purple patches ("hammered crystal"), and occasional redundancy ("promised to repay a debt"/"debt is settled") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of overwriting diminish momentum—"orchid solace" appears three times, and metaphorical density occasionally obscures clarity. The "sleepwalking paths" construction repeats without clear payoff. Information density is high but sometimes tips into purple prose territory.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is solid with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for scattered template constructions ("I realized," "I felt," "I resolved") and one paraphrase loop around faith/belief that slightly dulls momentum. The closing image effectively recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Prose maintains momentum through varied syntax without sacrificing clarity. Some figurative density in places ("molten gold cooling into typeface") approaches but doesn't cross into overwriting given the accumulative mode. Clean grammar and punctuation throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("galaxies bloomed like secrets admitting they wished to be found") but suffers from occasional overwriting. Some metaphors strain ("boots shining like overturned moons"). Information density is generally high, though phrases like "foolishly, exactly as" and "merely a winter curtain" could be tightened. The final line about "victorious" feels presumptuous.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "liquid words streamed across mangrove bark." Some figurative density in peak beats ("fierce and tender," "crescent and raw") without full payoff. Template cadence appears briefly in "She saw...She feared...She brushed" sequence but recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some abstract phrases ("unknot more than vines," "thread one fragile sentence through hearts") momentarily slow momentum. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in mid-section ("I came here to... My actual mission... Words sometimes...") but recovers for the closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows ambition but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most high-pressure beats without full payoff. Mixed metaphors ("joy...hovered like a shy bird" then "pry open her chest like sunrise") reduce clarity. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions. Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("gremlins," "editorial laughter"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("the world thinned like ice under midday sun" followed immediately by "Sound seemed to kneel"). Minor template cadence in the awakening sequence ("First she woke... Next she woke... Finally she woke") though it serves the pattern. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Plant the seed in any civic garden and the tendrils would rise in cursive twists"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("strings pulling every direction yet somehow knotting us together"). Minor template cadence in exposition sections.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though density of figurative language occasionally overwhelms ("reef-shadow joy," "contraband comfort" in close succession). Some paraphrase loops appear ("declared a blossom armistice" repeats the concept without advancement). Information density is high and momentum generally sustained, but metaphor-heavy passages sometimes sacrifice clarity for poetry.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose maintains high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Light sifted through the opalescent glass and scattered prisms across her gloves" advances action while revealing character and world. Some mild repetition around "deserted marvels" and occasional abstract phrasing ("museum of extinct feelings") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in describing the archive's musical response. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("symphony of truth" as "poetic code that unsettled her with its audacity") and some template phrasing in the diplomatic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful technical detail. Information density is high—most sentences advance both action and atmosphere. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("dappled resolve hanging in sulfurous air") and slight overwriting in metaphorical density during high-pressure moments. The "building breathes" repetition, while intentional, creates minor template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though several instances of abstract phrasing dilute immediacy ("blooming withering" appears twice, "becoming" as abstraction). Strong moments like "Trust shattered like cheap glass" and "Ash settled like gray snow over unused cages" demonstrate concrete imagery, but occasional overwriting ("perfumed runway into sky") reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("Low sun shards scattered across the drifting prism terrace"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. However, some abstract formulations muddy clarity ("the world had elongated itself after the butterfly effect"), and occasional template structures appear ("Mira thought of," "She understood," "Mira closed").

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "releasing stale kelp smells and a hush of shadowseam wonder." Some figurative density in peak beats ("spectral strings," "luminous respite") without clear pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears briefly ("She knelt...She gathered...She returned") but doesn't pervade. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The seeds pinged against quartz ribs, then rolled inward as if they knew the route better than she did." Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("elation that still respected loss") that could be more concretely embodied, but no loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of elegance ("coins still orbiting his knuckles") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around the core concept. "Orchestrated serendipity" appears three times, "calculated wilderness" twice. Some lines edge toward purple prose ("meteors whispered, as if signing receipts"). Information density is moderate—many sentences advance atmosphere without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("moonstone cabochon dust speck balanced on its palm"), but several instances of abstract phrasing that reduce immediacy: "choreographing emotion into stepwise ebb," "gravity came from chosen purpose." Some elevated diction borders on purple prose in places ("with obsidian grace she lifted"). The sentence-level propulsion remains strong despite these moments.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose density high with lines like "dawn stretched over sleeping boats" doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction ("tectonic murmurs," "noctilucent filaments") occasionally strains but serves the lyric mode. Information flows cleanly without loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery but suffers from density imbalance. Several metaphors strain credibility ("resigned cartography," "partial custody of his burdens"). Template cadence appears in places ("He told her... He asked... He said..."). The "bargained innocence" concept never clarifies despite multiple attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose demonstrates control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in accumulative passages. However, abstract phrasing proliferates ("serene upheaval," "dream pressure," "algebra of compassion") without concrete embodiment. Several paraphrase loops appear: "equations for hope"/"fresh coordinates of optimism" and repeated variations on timeline-crossing. The figurative density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("charting the acoustics of abandoned hallways the way old sailors once mapped currents"). Some overwriting appears in metaphor clusters ("lips trembling," "dead petals," "breathing secrets" in adjacent lines). Template cadence emerges in the "She [verb]" pattern across multiple paragraphs, though momentum generally sustains through varied paragraph lengths.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "each footstep returned a soft chord, like a throat clearing itself before confession." Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("dusky harmony" appears twice) and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("possibilities" as concept rather than specific image). The "prism parapet after rain" repetition feels slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, especially in ritual moments. However, several abstract constructions weaken immediacy: "title felt like an unhealed bruise," "eloquence for artillery silence," "shield capable of deflecting history's accusations." The "tomorrow and tomorrow again" echo works but borders on ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments: "Those cracks formed a map drawn by dried riverbeds, and Serafina read it the way priests read entrails." Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple purposes. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("fractured grace" appears twice, some metaphor density) and minor template patterns ("She withdrew...and issued," "She placed...and lifted"). The closing sequence maintains momentum despite these issues.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in sensory passages like "threads of silk, gold, and memory hung in shimmering skeins." Some abstract phrases weaken momentum ("the sanctuary, freed from its underworld, now arched above"), and occasional register drift appears ("symbolic proof that force had never been the key"). No major loops or scaffolding, but figurative density occasionally obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "clicked a calm metronome, each step rehearsing a reversal." Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("articulated puppets," "swirling vermilion ink") and one template construction ("He walked...He would take").

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose density is high with lines like "Wind vibrated the knot, producing a hush so pregnant that even the moss leaned closer" doing multiple jobs. Some metaphorical density in peak moments ("low petals of sound") occasionally obscures clarity. Information flows cleanly without loops or scaffolding, though a few abstract phrases like "veiled corners where logic and symbol shook hands" trend toward the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density stays high through most beats, with lines doing multiple jobs: "Molten bronze pooled in his crucible, starlight mirrored in its surface like molten constellations." However, some paraphrase loops appear: "These grooves were not ordinary encoding; they held transcribed memory" restates rather than advances. Template cadence emerges in "He [verb]" patterns across multiple sequential lines.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and information density. Strong opening/closing lines that mirror each other. Some figurative density in places ("gray confetti," "moonlight and ground glass") without clear payoff. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "I [verb]" constructions. No major loops or scaffolding that harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong syntactic variety and rhythmic control, with sentences modulating from short observations to complex accumulations. Information density is high - most lines advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("dusky harmony," "balanced within perpetual twilight") and one instance of mild redundancy around the covenant concept.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The grace, neither solid nor light, pressed against their skin like warm wind"). Some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("Reality would keep folding, unfolding, experimenting"). Rhythm varies naturally with scene pressure, accelerating during Tyra's breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density throughout. Some elevated diction ("vortex of breath," "essential contour") occasionally strains but serves the accumulative pattern. The prose maintains momentum while building texture, though a few abstract passages ("boundary between now and then") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves strong imagistic density ("stained glass suns," "guilt-colored maple scraps"). Information density high - most sentences advance multiple layers. Deductions for redundant phrasing ("endearingly feisty" repetition), occasional abstraction ("accidental wisdom perched quietly"), and some filter-verb clustering in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specific imagery, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("nonlinear inheritance," "simply complicated paradox") and some register drift into philosophical abstraction reduce immediacy. The "brightened disquiet" phrase appears twice, creating minor repetition. Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple layers.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong prose with high information density and inventive constructions that serve the fantastical setting. Lines like "pages fluttering like wings eager to be clipped and healed in the same motion" show controlled lyricism. Some metaphorical density in places ("curtained by footnotes that ripple like kelp") occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though density of figurative language occasionally impedes momentum ("serpents," "comets," "scarecrow" in quick succession). Some abstract constructions ("mood of trapped freedom," "memory is lighter in two bodies") could be more concrete. Information density high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, though some figurative density in peak beats ("absence itself fluoresced to annotate the margins of presence"). Information density high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for register drift into academic abstraction ("collective fables of absence, finally footnoted") and some synonym churn around clarity/confusion concepts. No major loops or scaffolding, but metaphor coherence wavers in the illumination sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines like "The harmonic caves rang with spent thunder, yet a hush like beaten metal settling over an anvil held the air in hammered repose" doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in opening creates mild opacity, and occasional abstract phrasing ("bloom of hush") recurs without always advancing pressure. Sentence variety and rhythm support the accumulative build effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The age was reckoned as after the collapse of civilization, a phrase mouthed with weary irony by survivors who remembered letters"). Some figurative density in places ("thistle-blown hope," "burial wind") but pattern-consistent. Minor scaffold in the machinery chamber sequence with sequential "One by one" construction.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("lightning stitched apertures in cloudbanks"). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats without full payoff ("the raw matter of a collective memory greater than any chronicle"). Minor abstract phrasing ("identity from experience") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery but suffers from overwriting in places: "fingers smelling faintly of black powder" works well, but "the gravity of hopelessness slacken by a thread" feels abstract. Some template phrasing appears ("Cyril smiled," "Cyril laughed," "Cyril heard"). The final line about gravity being "officially outvoted" lands effectively. Several instances of elevated diction ("combustive dreams," "ambient awareness") create register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose flows with good rhythm variety and strong imagery, but several abstract constructions weaken immediacy ("the texture of time was not smooth but corrugated," "transition periods, those subtle crackles in the flow of existence"). Some filter-verb clusters ("she felt," "she foresaw," "she realized") in the vision sequence dull propulsion. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Clouds lapped at the latticed beamwork") but some overwriting in figurative density ("comprehension sprouting in his expression like green through concrete"). Minor repetition of "intangibly tangible" and some abstract phrasing ("elastic tension that hummed") that could be more concrete. Information density is good overall.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some figurative density in early paragraphs ("dark velvet shaken across chandeliers") risks overwriting. The paraphrase loop "hush vaulting upward"/"vaulting hush expanded" costs -0.3, but overall propulsion remains clear with strong final line resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("solar panels lay shattered like ancient stained glass"), but several instances of abstract telling weaken immediacy: "futuristic nostalgia pulsed," "oppressive silence, as though expecting." The phrase "sally/sallying" appears twice unnecessarily. Information density is good but some passages lean toward decorative rather than functional description.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong figurative control mostly lands ("Night bled violet," "memory pressed against her ribs"). Some density excess in places ("loaded emptiness," "lanternless yet visible") approaches oversaturation but maintains coherence. Information density high—most lines do multiple jobs. Minor template moments ("Again, she said without speaking") but propulsion remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments like "stone liquefied into swirling equations, blue on blue" showcase controlled imagery. However, density issues appear in the corridor with mixed metaphors ("threads glowing, threads cracking") and some scaffold phrasing ("She told them nothing... only invited them"). The "virtuously mischievous" repetition feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    While individual sentences show craft ("Handle met spindle; metal kissed metal"), the prose suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence deploys figurative language, creating exhaustion rather than momentum. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She rose...She slipped...She turned"), and some metaphors strain clarity ("bridge of intuition, step by shimmering step").

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs—"braziers glowed with factually mystical oils that converted moon-darkness into trembling pearls of heat." Some figurative density approaches overwriting ("edges frayed like history's eyelids") but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor template moments ("Caron sensed," "Caron hesitated") create slight drag.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of striking precision—"her pulse kicked like a runaway stamp"—but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently in emotional beats. Some template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("She logged...She traced...She taught"). Information density is generally strong, with most sentences advancing multiple story functions, though occasional scaffolding phrases could be cut.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong moments like "each blade a coded freedom insisting on its own shimmer" but suffers from occasional overwriting ("auric lagoon under starlight" appears verbatim twice) and some abstract phrasing. The line "Memory fused with flesh; every silenced story found a harbor in her heartbeat" effectively does multiple jobs but edges toward metaphor density that could obscure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in peak beats ("stone vowels," "tuning forks struck by invisible hammers") risks overwriting but remains coherent. Minor template cadence appears in "He + verb" constructions mid-story. The prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful compression.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs (description advancing plot and theme simultaneously). Some figurative density in peak moments ("the ashen skyborne arbor hung above the valley like the upturned roots of a storm") and occasional abstraction ("tender weight of destiny") create minor friction without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong moments ("Every grain that drifted formed brief maps, then collapsed") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing. Some sentences strain for effect ("that stubborn paradox made him uncertainly certain"). Information density is generally good with most lines advancing multiple purposes, though metaphorical density in places obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in the alchemical sequences. However, several instances of elevated register ("silver rivulets," "verdict etched in steel") and some redundancy in emotional description. The prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity but inconsistently.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the harp both reveals spirits and serves as instrument of healing). Good syntactic variety and rhythm control. Deductions for figurative density that occasionally obscures clarity ("cramped prism," "mud-dreams") and some abstract phrasing ("luminous ache") that could be more concrete, particularly near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Memory returned not as images but as jerks of muscle"). Some abstract phrasing in the resolution sequence ("willingness to invert power," "transformation, dependent on") creates minor opacity, but overall the language is precise, propulsive, and free of loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs: "rope bridges...swayed above the shivering rooftops, threaded like veins between chimneys and moonlit laundry" establishes setting, atmosphere, and organic metaphor simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak beats ("anchors of intuition" appears three times) but serves the accumulative pattern. Prose rhythm accelerates through shorter segments as the fragment dissolves.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery like "ghosts materialized, their carnival costumes faded to opalescent grays." Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor redundancy in "weightless burden" appearing twice weakens impact. Some syntactic similarity in discovery sequence ("He understood... But years passed...") creates slight monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("clouds condensed into stairways, and librarians made of mist hurried up them"). Minor figurative density in places ("jeweled dot," "orchestral hush," "mathematical lullabies") and occasional abstract phrasing ("ontological shortcuts") create slight drag, but propulsion remains strong through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("time swirling like bronze smoke," "hurling hours and minutes like razor sleet") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently in high-pressure beats. Some abstract phrasing ("postponed revolutions," "emancipatory contours") reduces immediacy. The paraphrase loop between "failed to free ourselves/freed the future" and Velen's similar defeat needed tighter compression.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Each night he wound broken ballerinas back to poise"). Some overwrought figurative language ("bleeding auroras," "gong that folded into birdsong") occasionally muddles clarity. Rhythm varies purposefully though mystical descriptions trend purple.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and vivid imagery like "stalactites like fangs of an upside-down leviathan." Information density is high, with most sentences advancing atmosphere and stakes simultaneously. However, some abstract phrasing ("everything uncloaked at once," "impossible sum") and occasional redundancy ("trembling as though sniffing an unsolved riddle") create minor friction.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("timewoven alliances," "scaffold complexity with simplicity" appearing multiple times). Some mild redundancy in the alliance explanation section. The opening and closing images are particularly strong, with good momentum through most beats despite occasional density that slows reading.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"candles guttered in their sconces, releasing an umbral tenderness" combines action, atmosphere, and thematic echo. However, some figurative density approaches overwriting: "frost-bitten twigs" for eyebrows, "hissed like comets" for spray paint. The recurring "dawning hush" and "umbral tenderness" risk becoming template phrases though they serve the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the beach sequence. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "melted corridors" mixed with "muddy protest streets" creates metaphor confusion; "word-kayak across the ages" strains credibility. Template phrasing in "Mara knelt...Mara realized...Mara remembered" reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, particularly in the accumulative middle section. Information density high in lines like "Light poured out and unfurled across Paper-Lantern Cove like a resurrected tide." However, template cadence appears in "One by one he fed..." sequence and some paraphrase loops around the bottle's properties. Filter verb cluster in "Silas realized... He lifted... He watched" dulls immediacy in a key discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments like "liquid memory glowed beneath, neither water nor sap but a distillation of every laugh and sigh" show high information density. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("He hesitated, sensing that archiving emotion sometimes meant releasing it, not shelving it" restates earlier realization). The prose maintains momentum through varied syntax, though occasional overwriting ("velvet disquiet" appears twice) slightly dulls precision.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong imagistic density and varied syntax, but occasional overwriting in figurative language ("heartbeat suspended between flake and star"). Some conceptual abstraction around entropy mechanics creates brief opacity. The "furiously tranquil" repetition works as purposeful pattern rather than redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variations, from the contemplative opening to urgent "At precisely fourteen hundred hours." Some passages suffer from technical density ("stratified squalls were corkscrewing up the western ravine") that prioritizes information over momentum. The final image lands cleanly, though middle sections contain removable scaffolding like "Mara felt her pulse sync with the darkening sky."

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, with strong moments like "Vacuum howled beyond the field, yet inside the hatch a stillness bloomed." Abstract phrasing clusters in places ("tender faculty," "flourishing stillness," "sympathetic resonance") create mild opacity. Information density is generally high with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity like "emerald shards of long dried royal jelly," though occasional elevation strains: "choreography of quiet" feels slightly forced. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "He [verb]" structures. The closing image effectively recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments of propulsive imagery ("Rain shimmered like torn clock faces") balance against occasional overwriting and register drift. The "velvet made of absent instants" and similar constructions risk purple prose in peak beats. Some template cadence appears ("He had...," "He set...," "He finally...") and abstract constructions like "anticipated mysteries coiling outward from possibility" slow momentum. The closing image recovers with concrete power.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong sentence-level craft with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density high - most sentences advance both atmosphere and meaning. Some elevated diction risks purple prose ("burnished hush," "jangling quarrels") but stays controlled. The "woven dawns" metaphor recurs effectively without becoming mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("Death's deadline freed her") but suffers from occasional density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences during the wire-installation sequence without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in "She gathered...She wired...She felt" progression. Information density is generally high with purposeful detail.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and good momentum. However, several issues: abstract phrases like "luminous skeptic," some redundancy ("rainwashed"/"rain"), and occasional overwriting ("whispered that return could be inquiry, not retreat"). The "bronze quiet" repetition works as pattern but some sentences strain for effect over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions—"Seeds alone, however, could not awaken the bruised earth; the soil had drunk too much salt and sorrow" combines plot advancement, metaphor, and causality. Some elevated diction occasionally creates distance ("subpoenaed," "chlorophyll"), and there's minor repetition in the bird-calling sequences. Line-level craft is generally strong with varied syntax and purposeful paragraph structure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere and plot simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak beats ("bruised stars," "antennae shadows") without clear payoff. Minor template cadence in "I + verb" constructions mid-story. The opening and closing lines effectively frame the transformation of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong momentum with varied sentence lengths creating visual rhythm. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character state, and symbolic weight simultaneously. Some mild figurative density in emotional beats ("darkness poured over the deck like cold water") but serves accumulative texture rather than obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The plan smelled of brass gears, old promises, and caution wrapped around abandon"). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Minor repetition of "certainty/uncertainty" concept could be more varied, but overall propulsion is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Multiple instances of abstract phrasing that risk opacity ("nomadic penumbra searching for settled light," "gravestones of propaganda"). Some filter constructions and synonym loops around memory/gesture concepts. Information density high but occasionally sacrifices clarity for poetry.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, though some abstract phrases ("heavier than regret," "crushing") lack specificity. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers. Minor loops in thematic territory ("seeding/seed/seeded" appears 5 times). The opening and closing lines effectively bracket the transformation with concrete images.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. However, several instances of elevated register drift ("winnow truth from regret," "fierce repose") and some abstract phrasing ("woven hush," "braided, taut") that could be more concrete. The "fidgets productively" construction feels forced. Information density is good but inconsistent.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Information density high in places like "She wore an innocently mischievous smile that confused the vultures." Deductions for occasional overwriting ("ricocheted off the canyon walls, returned enlarged, collided again") and some abstract phrasing around forgiveness that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks that mirror breathing rhythms. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some repetition of "gold" and "narrated" serves pattern but borders on excessive. The final image achieves memorable compression.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some overwriting appears ("Salt dusk draped," "spilled turpentine"). Information density is high in key beats. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing and one instance of template cadence in the cave sequence ("He folded...He had...He believed").

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("expression of screaming tenderness," "enormity of caring"). Information density remains high with most sentences advancing both plot and atmosphere. Some metaphorical density in peak moments risks opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves strong imagery but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without always advancing pressure. Some phrases feel overwrought: "grieving breath," "rouge and eager to move again." The paraphrase loop in "her sense of self fluctuates with moon phases" echoes the earlier identical phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong sensory specificity ("tasting rust and orchard mold," "knobs smelling of wet parchment") with good information density. Minor template cadence in middle sections ("He gathered...He realized...") and occasional abstract phrasing ("psychological safety") that could be more embodied. Prose generally propels forward with varied rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery like "the sea whispered like torn silk." Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. Minor repetition of "softly persistent" works as intentional pattern but occasional abstraction like "distance implode like folded maps" could be more concretely grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the creek climbed higher, reminding him choice could not wait for full flood"). Some overwriting appears ("bioluminescent moss painted the interior emerald") and occasional template phrasing ("heart drumming louder than the water"). The movable-type door description effectively merges the literal and metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("luminescence seeping through invisible wounds to pool on the stone in quivering runes"). Some repetitive constructions ("Sereya felt," "Sereya knelt," "Sereya rose") could vary, but momentum remains steady.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "vials that glowed like held sunsets, eager to be uncorked" combines description, metaphor, and personification efficiently. Rhythm varies naturally from short declarations ("The words were simple") to complex accumulations. Minor weakness in occasional abstraction ("density of presence") that could be more concretely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density and varied rhythm, particularly in lines like "I folded my jealousy into a paper plane of breath." Some figurative density in peak beats ("metallic bees," "memory-starved animals") occasionally stacks without full payoff, and a few abstract constructions ("jaded wonder") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments of sensory precision ("blackened, delicate, threaded more finely than any clock pin") and effective rhythm variation. However, abstract phrases recur ("emotional terrain" appears 3 times, "ordinary miracles" twice) creating mild loops. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("valleys of loss, peaks of stubborn wonder, rivers where scent memory once flowed") without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("crystallizes when stressed" works literally for tea and metaphorically for Seren). Some mild repetition around "scars" and occasional elevated diction ("saturated hush," "tethered only by silent incense ropes") slightly dulls momentum but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong moments like "blue sparks crawled over filing cabinets, writing accidental sharps of lightning" show precise image-making, but occasional abstraction ("Perfect time for imperfect miracles") and mild redundancy in the gossip-apology connection reduce density. The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths and clear spatial choreography of the archive scene.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("Whispers gathered in the high rafters, but no voice dared descend") but suffers from abstract density in places. Some phrases edge toward purple ("the resounding hush felt like dawn"). Information density high but occasionally opaque ("spiral arbitration, the court of becoming" needs clearer grounding).

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("Wind scraped the cliff with razor edges, slicing mist into translucent shavings") but suffers from occasional abstraction and repetitive structures. The "He [verb]" pattern appears frequently, and some philosophical passages drift into telling rather than embodying insight. Information density varies, with strong sensory passages alternating with more abstract rumination.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though "quiet wildfire" appears twice as descriptor. Information density high in descriptive passages. Minor template cadence in "She [verb], [verb-ing]" pattern in middle section. The "physics of letting go" phrase risks abstraction but earns its repetition through accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information-dense prose with lines doing multiple jobs ("turning pages the way a card shark flips decks"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("afternoon light dripped like diluted jade") and abstract constructions ("clover melancholy which hovers"). Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The booth light dims as though exhaling a chapter it has finished reading." Some elevated diction ("melodically haunted ring," "cultivated estrangement") fits the lyric mode but occasionally approaches overwriting. The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery ("salt met perfume," "sand[ing] sharp edges into polish"). Some density issues in middle sections with abstract phrasing ("context changes were recorded instead of resisted"). Minor filter verb clustering ("I realized," "I asked," "I understood") dulls immediacy in spots but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with memorable phrases ("tomorrow negotiates with yesterday"). Information density is high in peak beats. Some paraphrase loops appear mid-story ("Milo was bound by reciprocity"/"promptly fulfilled the first clause"). Template cadence in the stranger arrival sequence. No artifacts touch the closure, which maintains propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The ring did not point north; it swiveled toward longing itself"). Some abstract phrases like "quiet blaze" and "hidden stillpoint" repeat without always advancing meaning. The final third maintains momentum despite dense imagery, though a few passages edge toward purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong metaphorical coherence, though some passages edge toward density ("confidently uncertain" appears twice; extended gardening metaphor). The comma/editing conceit carries multiple narrative jobs effectively. Minor template cadence in "For the civilization of Heliora... For the migratory libraries" structure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, but some overwriting in figurative density—"moon rippled like a drumskin struck from underneath" amid already dense metaphor. Template cadence appears in "She knelt...She signed...She lowered" sequence. Information density is high but occasionally tips into ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful fragments like "Promise rescued." Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive "volcanic tenderness" (appears twice), some abstract phrasing ("analytically intuitive" feels forced), and the slightly mechanical "Thus began" transition.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves lyric density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The hush of the universe inhaling"). Some redundancy appears mid-story ("Ira felt...she felt"), and occasional abstract phrasing ("patient grief she did not yet understand") weakens immediacy. Strong propulsion in final third compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The key chimed against his belt like a question he had not yet phrased" establishes object, sound, and psychological state. Syntax varies effectively between short declarations and complex observations. Some elevated diction ("auroral canyons," "cartographic wink") fits the slightly fantastical tone without overwhelming.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery like "lampfire trembled like captive moons." Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("spiralingly calm, drawing thought inward like slow whirlpools"), some filter-verb clustering ("I felt," "I realized," "I recognized"), and the abstract "pain is a map, not a cage" line that briefly breaks the concrete imagery pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density strong in lines like "Every window burst to life exactly as planned, the cobalt library in mist anchoring the sequence." However, abstract phrases like "the hush where past meets prophecy" and "amplified quiet" appear multiple times without sufficient grounding. Some elevated diction ("swathed," "confederate") creates mild register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean, propulsive prose with varied sentence structures and strong maritime vocabulary. Information density is high throughout, though occasional abstract phrases ("tidal animal beneath his ribs") could be more concrete. The final image effectively recharges earlier motifs without loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythmic variation and imagery ("blades slicing clouds into obedient ribbons"), but occasional abstract phrasing ("emotional void," "engineered silence") and slight redundancy in describing the hush. The whittling sequence maintains excellent momentum through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Night settled, but cobalt panes above us stored twilight like blue coals" manages time, setting, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops or scaffolding detected. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm supporting the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of exceptional beauty ("glass expanded irregularly, like a phoenix feather twisted by wind") but suffers from occasional overwriting and register drift. Some phrases feel artificially elevated ("bartered awakenings practiced after the phoenix rises"). Information density is high and momentum generally sustained, though the mythic register occasionally obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Emergency lights dim, and dusty organ pipes glitter"). Some abstract phrasing ("texture of connection," "shape of yearning touching resistance") and occasional register drift ("sympathetic material") prevent higher scoring, though prose momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("She finally cried, not out of ache, but out of space made for tomorrow") but suffers from density issues in places. Figurative language occasionally overwhelms, as in "genuinely artificial yet longing for skin" which mixes registers awkwardly. Some paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the theme of coordinates leading "not only upward, but inward" which gets restated rather than developed through new imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density - "After the cryptocurrency crashes, commission work had slowed, but mysteries clotted thicker than ever" delivers world-state, economic pressure, and thematic setup efficiently. Varied syntax from fragments to complex sentences creates rhythm. Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("inherited mystery seeped") and some filter constructions ("Mirelle realized"), but propulsion remains strong through concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("twilight could not follow," "sun setting inside itself"). Minor template cadence appears in the "I [verb]" pattern mid-story, and occasional abstract phrasing ("terrible wisdom," "fragile lattice of choices") could ground more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong imagery density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The librarian, a sharp-eyed dusk noticer named Eira" introduces character, required element, and atmosphere simultaneously. Some abstract phrasing ("luminous regret," "shape of hope") occasionally replaces concrete imagery. The "shadow unbound" repetition works as pattern but borders on overuse. Clean prose rhythm supports the lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and strong verb choices. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. However, several instances of elevated diction clash with established register ("velvet field of stars," "patient snakes"), and some metaphors strain clarity. The opening contains minor redundancy in scene-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression, with effective short declarations ("She welcomed it") balancing longer lyrical passages. Information density is generally high, though some metaphors don't advance story ("Silence lay over the quiet tower at dawn, spreading like sootless ash"). Minor redundancies appear ("meteor hush" used twice, "silver motes" repeated). The surgical sequence maintains clarity despite metaphorical overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong sentence-level craft with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery. Information density is high - most lines advance atmosphere, character, or concept simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak moments ("motes of freed affection swept past her ribs") but maintains pattern coherence. Minor repetition of "hushed thunder" bookending.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, some figurative density in non-peak moments ("moth wings desperate for moonlight," "curtains of green and violet fire") and occasional abstract phrasing ("intervals of stillness were not pauses but punctuation marks") create minor drag. Information density is generally high with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("waves shimmered across the dune, not of sand but of probability"). Minor register elevation in places ("wave functions given flesh") but the lyric mode sustains it. Some slight redundancy in the archive descriptions costs precision.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Rain clinked like coins against metal leaves" establishes setting, atmosphere, and the mechanical nature simultaneously). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control throughout. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("wild frontier of his mind" appears three times) and the slightly overwrought "herds of ivory glyphs" metaphor in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, though some metaphorical density obscures momentum ("mist slid over the gunwales, wrapping Lis in damp vellum"). The piece occasionally loops conceptually, particularly around the courage theme. Several sentences could be tightened without losing atmosphere. The "gloaming" and "vellum" vocabulary feels slightly precious for the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("luggage like votive offerings," "heartbeat echoed off walls") but suffers from paraphrase loops ("silence as law, harsher than any posted order" restates prior content) and occasional overwriting in figurative density. Filter verbs cluster in emotional beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong control with varied rhythm and purposeful compression. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs: "shelves rearranging imperceptibly, preparing for whatever truths would next require careful ink." Some elevated diction borders on purple ("verdigris," "ostentatious stationery") but serves the mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Mist hung like lazy gauze around the sea level monitoring station, and the world felt drifting yet moored." Strong syntactic variety, no loops or scaffolding. The seismometer "translating tectonic murmurs into light blinks" exemplifies precise technical language serving atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Thunder rolled somewhere topside, maybe a collapsing girder, maybe the sky itself remembering its voice"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("condemned angels," "petrified snakes," "captive nebulae") and occasional register elevation, but propulsion remains clear through varied syntax and purposeful repetition of "hum."

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("moved like a rumor," "her shawl patched with moss and whispers of insurgency") but suffers from template cadence in places and some paraphrase loops. The line "Tradition had survived the war, but now... it had begun to evolve with intent" essentially restates the thematic premise rather than embodying it through image.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines like "gulls wheeling like loose gears above the shattered lighthouse lens." Some filter verb clusters appear ("Anisa watched," "knowing," "she pictured") but don't obscure closure. The "bruised purple" clouds and "silhouettes of questions" show controlled figurative language, though a few passages edge toward overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("lighthouse that rose like a gaunt finger," "walls seemed to breathe inward"). Deductions for occasional overwriting ("marble columns of shelved dust"), some abstract phrasing that reduces clarity ("fragmented reality clung to him like wet linen"), and minor repetition of "untangling threads." Information density good but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing discovery or atmosphere, but figurative language occasionally overwhelms clarity ("canvas ridges like reluctant ink," "words erased mid thought"). Some template cadence appears in the chamber description sequence, though the closing lines achieve strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied sentence structures. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("dizzying quiet," "merciless chill") and some template phrasing patterns ("She wondered," "She pictured"). The final lines achieve genuine resonance without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves solid density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Cullin entered, boots dusted, eyes scanning corners like a man who had forgotten stillness"). Some figurative excess ("memory quaked," "sandstorms," "shoulders loosening like knots undone by warm rain") but maintains clarity. Minor template cadence in the council arrival sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the cool-headed fisher who cast nets not into water but into vibration").

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language, though density occasionally tips toward overwriting ("planets revolving in choreographed orbits of regret"). Some passages exhibit mild template cadence ("She asked...Felix answered...He explained") that dulls momentum in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally strong prose with evocative phrases like "meteors whispered instead of shattering" and clean information density.

The clarity remains strong throughout with good syntactic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves good density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwrought metaphors appear ("hearts banging against ribs like urgent drums"). Information flow remains clear with varied sentence structures. Minor template patterns emerge in the departure sequence but don't significantly harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong rhythmic control and imagery density, but several instances of abstract elevation harm momentum: "futurally summoned," "rebellions of kindness," "aberrant mercy can anneal." The phrase "retrocognitively trapped" appears twice without variation. Template structure emerges in "He saw...He spoke...He opened" sequence. These artifacts don't touch closure but accumulate in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong sensory density and varied syntax create momentum, particularly in the time-braiding sequence. However, some figurative density approaches overwriting ("nostalgia rises like chimney smoke from winters I have yet to live") and occasional register elevation ("facet-cut," "harmonized by shared relief") creates minor friction with the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Several instances of overwriting detract: "fractally precise" appears twice, some purple patches ("iridescent hush," "willowglass hope"), and occasional template phrasing ("I, Liora the affectionate skeptic"). The "citrus and graphite" sensory detail is precise but some metaphors strain ("moon skin").

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and vivid imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("inverted cathedrals," "arrhythmic lexicon"). Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions, but some abstract passages ("grammatical" transformation) slightly impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("carrying a cracked ledger and the faint smell of ground quartz"). Some figurative density in places ("tiny planets," "bleached skull of night") but serves the accumulative design. Minor scaffold in "Exhausted but radiant" could be cut.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in metaphor density ("critic tugging at a frayed script," "sutures," "gold seed in barren soil") creates slight coherence friction. Template cadence appears briefly ("She paused...She added...then straightened").

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments like "ripples formed circles...like a giant tree showing age in motion" demonstrate control. However, "ambient awareness" appears three times, "spindrift serenity" twice, creating mild repetition. Some abstract phrasing ("service continues only while doubt endures") could be more concrete, though overall clarity and momentum remain solid.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "exhaled dust instead of doubt" and effective compression. Some figurative density in places ("phototropic to kindness" appears 4 times) borders on overuse but serves the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("moonlight varnished the current") but suffers from repetitive structures and the phrase "rhythm of oars in water" appearing four times without sufficient variation. Several filter verb stacks reduce immediacy. The template cadence "He [verb], then [verb]" pattern appears in multiple sequences, though the lyrical moments partially compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose maintains strong rhythm and varies sentence length effectively, creating momentum through the descent sequence. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some abstract phrasing ("responsibility seeks outlets," "comfortable narratives") could be more concrete. The "small reflective agent" and "reference material" in the final paragraph feel slightly overwrought but don't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose density serves the accumulative mode with lines doing multiple jobs: "sculptor Arun had woven thousands of salvaged objects into passages one had to physically wander." Some abstraction creeps in ("great conversation," "newly braided") but rhythm control through varied sentence lengths maintains momentum. The final image of signing "with the world itself" risks overreach but lands within the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose shows strong moments like "each pulse hiding something sharp beneath its music" but suffers from occasional overwriting ("tattered astronomical charts...like candles in a crypt").

Information density is generally good with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some overwrought phrases ("star-choked sky," "centuries of cold duty") and occasional register elevation beyond the POV's natural voice. Template cadence appears briefly in the middle section with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with evocative moments ("mist twirling like pale serpents"). Information density varies - strong in discovery sequences but padded elsewhere. Several instances of overwriting ("dawn never reached the shadowed quarry in mist") and abstract phrasing ("emotional geometry vivid") that could be more concrete. The phrase "lanced" appears twice, suggesting limited verb variety.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("nervously confident, like someone who had practiced courage before a cracked mirror"). Some overwriting in metaphors ("continents of frostbite") and occasional density issues. Information density high but a few redundant constructions ("somewhere beyond the horizon" in final line adds little).

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Wind rose from the valley, tugging at the orange scaffold wrap"). Figurative language occasionally overreaches ("frozen tear of photography," "pixelated amnesty") creating mild coherence friction. The rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the corridor sequence, though some abstract phrases ("amnesty, once granted, would never pixelate to nothing again") slightly muddle clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("wind rattled trapeze chains in gentle applause"), but several issues: template cadence in "Eliot felt/heard/saw" constructions, register drift into abstract philosophy ("something vital stands guard where we pretend only numbers dwell"), and ornamental metaphors that don't advance pressure. The paraphrase loop around "paths circle back" costs clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("sunset trapped in fiber") but suffers from abstract noun clusters ("comprehension had become communal") and some elevated register drift. Information density is generally strong. Notable template cadence in "She whispered... She understood... She broadcast" sequence deducts -0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong imagery. Deductions for repetitive constructions ("She touched...She stepped...She spoke") and some abstract phrases that could be more concrete ("warlike serenity" appears twice).

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful imagery. Information density is good—most lines advance story or atmosphere. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("inlaying meaning everywhere" appears twice), some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete, and elevated diction that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies ("trammel" used twice).

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine lyricism ("dust motes that spun like glitter remembered by aging eyes") but suffers from repetitive constructions and the verbatim repeat of "insulating emotionally with facts." Some sentences strain under metaphorical weight, particularly in the middle sections where abstract phrases accumulate.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied syntax. The repetition of "kindly methodical" (4x), "haunted ambitions" (3x), and "touching distance" (4x) creates pattern but borders on excessive. Some metaphorical density in places ("kernels that once germinated ideas in civilizations now dust") without full clarity payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Brass flywheels around her wrists ticked in lullaby tempo, breathing wintersun serenity into the salt fog." Some elevated diction ("lunar persuasion") fits the mythic register. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple elements. Some figurative density in peak moments ("colors he had no names for") serves the accumulative mode. Minor repetition of "resonant hush" and "latent radiance" creates pattern but risks becoming mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several instances of elevated diction ("penitent rhythm," "confluence, not a confession") and some redundancy in the water metaphor system.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several instances of overwriting: "rose-colored fog rolled across the abandoned plaza as dusk surrendered to possibility" strains for effect. Some filter-verb clusters ("She saw confessions unborn," "She realized") dull immediacy in key discovery moments. The final paragraph's "having spoken nothing yet having heard everything" lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong information density and varied syntax, but overwriting appears in phrases like "frost-bright and brittle" and "tentative plum hope" that prioritize ornament over clarity. Some template structures emerge ("She understood...She lifted...She answered") though the prose maintains momentum through the closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The gem dimmed, its fire willingly imprisoned" conveys action, cost, and personification simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("radiant hush," "lattice") fits the ceremonial context, though occasional abstract phrases like "threshold of stillness inside herself" could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("vineyard hush," "umbral grotto," "duskstone labyrinths"). Information density is generally high with most sentences advancing multiple purposes. Some abstract phrasing ("hollow he could not name," "wordless") could be more concrete, and a few metaphors strain slightly, but line-level craft supports the lyrical mode without major impediment.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations and strong information density. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("something inside unhooks"), some filter verb clustering in reflective passages, and minor template cadence in the wind chime decoding sequence. The lyric compression mostly works but occasionally obscures immediate clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in setting-character integration. However, register drift appears in peak moments ("perfect arrival where nothing extraneous remained," "widening dawn") that clash with established voice. Some metaphors strain clarity ("smelling salts moonlight"), and occasional template cadence emerges in the descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Wind moaned between the towers of bone in a canyon of endless echoes" establishes setting, atmosphere, and acoustic properties). Some elevated diction ("historically reverent," "appraise") slightly strains but serves the mythic register. Clear propulsion through varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though some metaphorical density ("coiling like incubating thought," "consonants kissing") occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor register elevation in places ("meteor hush cloaking the tide with ash-soft silence") serves the accumulative mode, though occasionally approaches overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, with effective compression in phrases like "all edges and no middle" and high information density throughout. Some figurative density in non-peak moments ("stellar doubt murmuring through every frequency") and the abstract phrase about time being "all edges and no middle" creates mild opacity, though the prose maintains momentum toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("scythe folded like regret"). Varied sentence structures create natural rhythm without template patterns. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("cosmic roaring") and one instance of elevated diction that slightly strains ("ligature between me and the snarling illustrations").

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Below, tides sighed; above, constellations faded" establishes setting while suggesting cosmic judgment. Strong verb choices ("sighed," "quivered," "roared") carry weight. Minor repetition of "earnestly naive" and some filter constructions ("Orin understood," "Orin realized") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition ("mirrored hush" bookending). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. However, some ornate constructions edge toward overwriting: "breadcrumbs of silver nitrate," "leviathan" metaphor. The phrase "precisely humane" appears twice, which reads as intentional pattern but risks feeling workshopped.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional elevated diction ("gossamer," "conflagration") slightly strains the register. Some metaphorical density in peak beats ("threads of silver light leaked between her fingers, weaving into the air") borders on overwriting but remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("nocturnal arbor," "moral inertia") but remains within bounds. No significant loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information-dense prose with strong rhythm variation, but figurative density overwhelms in places ("Pale lightning climbed from the exposed brain, entering her chest, performing surgery without blades"). Several instances of elevated diction clash with immediacy. The "her logic still slices through pretense" callback feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("nocturnal haven," "velvet hush"). The recurring lock/puzzle metaphors maintain coherence without becoming strained, and sentence variety creates effective rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves moments of striking originality ("silence sounds overdressed," "mournfully eager") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most high-pressure sentences without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in the parallel "He..." constructions mid-story, and phrases like "transubstantiation" create register drift that momentarily breaks voice.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong sentence-level craft with varied rhythm and high information density, particularly in lines like "statues bloomed with rime instead of roses." Some abstract passages ("waiting has always been my secret action") and occasional register elevation ("dimensionally homesick") create minor friction but don't obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    While individual sentences achieve poetic resonance ("dying coals hummed like tired angels"), the piece suffers from abstract conceptual language ("successive approximation," "creative destruction") that creates distance. Several passages loop similar ideas ("vivify the staff...vivify himself"), and filter constructions ("He realized," "He felt," "He expected") accumulate in crucial beats, dulling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but some figurative density clusters without payoff ("nimbus," "wandering photons," "mythic in the freshly born acoustics"). Template cadence appears briefly ("She reached...She felt...She placed"). The prose achieves momentum through varied paragraph lengths and strategic compression of the ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of excellence ("when clocks run sideways in the harbor's uncanny fog") but suffers from occasional overwriting. Filter constructions like "Milo felt" and "He understood" accumulate in key beats. Some metaphors stretch thin ("corridors of bone"), though line-level clarity generally serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs: "architects built bridges of steel; she would span chasms of meaning." Some overwriting appears in metaphor density ("prayer scrolls," "patient beast," "quiet lightning" in opening paragraphs) without clear pattern-teaching. Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks that mirror the story's breathing pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some abstract phrases lack concrete grounding ("expanding destinies," "reverence"). Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for occasional elevated diction that borders on purple ("velvet column of current") and some conceptual abstraction that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures. Some overwriting in figurative language ("glass roof cracked, ivy threading iron ribs like green veins"). Repetition of "persistently curious" reads as intentional pattern. Minor loops with "reeling hush" variations. Information density is high but occasionally tips into density for its own sake.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Salt wind sighed," "crashing hush") but occasional overwrought metaphors ("whispers rubbing copper jackets raw against barnacles") and some abstract phrasing ("crowding comfort of shared purpose"). Information density is high and momentum sustained, though a few lines edge toward purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "clouds parted; stars glinted like fresh bolts." However, several instances of abstract telling ("a habit sharpened by survival," "craving coherence the way frozen hands crave fire") and some repetitive constructions in the middle section. The density of figurative language occasionally overwhelms in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "copper-veined storyteller, his skin threaded with metallic filaments that glimmered whenever memory touched sunlight."

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Frost stung the iron hatch...every rung hummed like a tuning fork yearning for spring"). Some figurative language approaches oversaturation ("gleams that threaded the frigid air") but generally serves the accumulative texture. Minor issues with clarity in the transformation sequence where physical logic becomes deliberately ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("bow slicing air like a lantern carving tunnels") though occasionally dense. Information density high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition of "resonantly soft" but it's the required attribute.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.7)

Some figurative density in peak beats ("needle with thunder") and occasional register elevation ("hushed wars of paperwork") create minor friction. Strong opening and closing lines that recharge the brittle hush motif.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "His hands, scarred yet gracefully sure, tap patterns on cedar planks as if decoding a hidden alphabet." Some figurative density in peak moments ("folding ladders of silk") but serves the magical realism. Momentum sustains through varied syntax and purposeful repetition of "inside the chime of wind bells."

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("sanely eccentric mind began its nightly routine" characterizes while advancing).

    Clean, purposeful prose with high information density—each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot simultaneously. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. No loops or scaffolding detected. Figurative language serves rather than ornaments.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("Liora captured the motes, weaving them into a shimmering ribbon that hovered above the frame") with strong rhythm control. However, abstract constructions like "Wonder, Orien believed, faded from villages the moment children learned fear outweighed curiosity" and occasional overwriting ("distilled essence of first surprise") create distance where immediacy would strengthen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation, though some figurative density approaches overwriting ("Glass moons drifted above"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition in "accumulated silence" variants, but this serves the accumulative structure. Some abstract moments could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong moments like "Through that absent quadrant one could almost sense wind from uncharted hills" but suffers from occasional overwriting ("aureate coastline") and template structures. Information density is generally high with purposeful compression, though phrases like "methodically curious, yet guarded, cultivating a tone of shielded openness" feel overwrought. The ending image effectively recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Fame evaporates quickly at depth; pressure squeezes it into silence") but several instances of abstract telling weaken momentum. Filter constructions appear frequently ("I felt," "I imagined," "I understood") without voice justification. Some paraphrase loops around the letting go concept dilute impact.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong syntactic variety and information density, particularly in the encoding sequence where "Color and sound interlaced until the courtyard became an enormous oscilloscope."

    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Icicles hung like punctuation" establishes setting while suggesting the library's grammatical nature. No loops or scaffolding, strong syntactic variety. Every image advances either atmosphere or Selene's transformation. Clean propulsion through varied sentence lengths that breathe with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several strong images ("Orange moons hung above," "bruised yet blooming") anchor the prose, but figurative density sometimes overwhelms clarity ("fear pressed thorns into my optimism"). Template constructions appear ("Throughout, Serafin's voice kept writing") and some sentences strain for effect rather than precision. The final paragraph recovers momentum with cleaner, more direct language.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence lengths creating rhythm, though "bruised awe" appears three times without variation. Information density high—most sentences advance both atmosphere and plot. Some figurative density in peak moments ("thunderless lightning stitched the horizon") but serves the lyric mode.

No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density varies—strong passages like "She unpacked a coil of fiber-optic nerves, circuits she had grown rather than soldered" doing multiple jobs, but weaker sections rely on abstract descriptors ("profound transformation," "quieter revolutions"). Some metaphor strain appears ("helix-minded," "lightning-borne intuition") and the phrase "quaking reverie" repeats without evolution, creating mild redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("darkness dense enough to bruise thought," "clandestinely luminous" used twice). Template cadence emerges in the middle section with repetitive "He [verb]" constructions. The figurative density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in the threshold sequence. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance the story but some descriptive passages could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "chalk squares on wagon doors" and "sparrows stopped debating the wind." However, some overwriting appears in peak beats ("hopeful melancholy flooded Tomas") and template constructions ("He felt certain... though no opponent approached"). Minor scaffold in explaining the "translating silence" concept rather than purely demonstrating it.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the sonic experiment sequences. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot simultaneously. However, several instances of ornamental language don't serve pressure ("lacquer settles on a violin"), and "intuitively descriptive" appears twice as forced modifier. The theatrical register occasionally tips toward overwriting but maintains clarity at closure.

Strong opening and closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The sheet glowed like trapped dawn, and inside its resinous panes faint staves flickered"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("certify wonder as essential," "oscillating repose") and the extended metaphor of sculptor/chisel, while coherent, creates slight opacity in places.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, particularly in "Air vibrated; frost dust rose from crevices like startled spirits, yet no echo returned." Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high and most sentences do multiple jobs, but repetitive constructions appear ("Ira spun...Ira saw...Ira closed"). The "stoically sparkling" phrase repeats four times without clear pattern-teaching. Some metaphors strain ("lightning the iron dawn") and the prose occasionally reaches for elevated diction that doesn't quite land.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("azure defiance stained the sky, a color found only after calamity refuses to fade politely"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in middle section ("Ellan remembered... He closed... He surrendered...") and some abstract phrasing ("hollow ache") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The tide rolled ink-black along the breakwater when Ellis Moor cut the engine" establishes time, atmosphere, and character arrival). Some figurative density in peak beats ("luminescent ache in his ribs," "breath inside someone else's lungs") without full payoff. Template cadence appears briefly ("Ellis realized... He felt... He stayed...") but doesn't pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "broken waves drummed a tempo equal parts lullaby and alarm." Some elevated diction ("shadowed elation coursed outward") approaches overwriting but serves the accumulative pattern. Occasional abstraction ("duality that suited the shadowed elation humming in her ribs") could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.3)

The "ordinary miracles" phrase appears twice, weakening its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong figurative coherence throughout ("dawn thicker than silk," "shadows grew roots"). Information density high—most sentences advance both literal and thematic layers. Some filter verb clustering ("I realized," "I sensed") in middle section slightly dulls immediacy. Final paragraph's "swaddle them until they could fly" risks mild thematic echo but earns through concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several passages suffer from abstract density that slows momentum: "wisdom grows only when shared, never when caged" and similar philosophical statements. The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("streets polished enough to mirror his silhouette") but accumulates template phrases like "keenly empathetic nature" and "unsaid calculations." The repetition of "staying while leaving" works thematically but becomes mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("steam shaping a fleeting dragon") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing. Template cadence appears in middle sections ("Elias feels... Elias admits... Elias closes"), and metaphorical density sometimes obscures rather than clarifies ("latent gratitude begins to sprout"). The closing image lands cleanly, preventing lower score.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong prose density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The frozen library above the clouds drifted in a quartz hush" establishes setting, tone, and isolation simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("mail sleds hung like iron fruit") with strong information density and varied rhythm, particularly in discovery sequences. However, some template patterns emerge ("She packed...then stepped," "One by one") and abstract phrases like "visible cost" and "truthful seed" lean toward conceptual summary rather than embodied imagery in places.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density high in descriptive passages. However, abstract phrases like "color of wonder" and "symphonies of truth" appear multiple times without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("dust sifted through the vents") but several density issues: "Contain chaos, the note repeated" creates a paraphrase loop, and some metaphors edge toward over-decoration ("heartbeat moss," "sorrowful carillon"). The filter-verb cluster around the fire sequence ("I felt," "I gathered," "I turned off") dulls momentum in a crucial beat.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("Low desert light painted the apartment complex in copper") but suffers from overwriting in places ("murmured beneath her quiet smile," "wavered like wind over dunes").

Information density is uneven, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others loop concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("ocean pressed above like an enormous memory"). The "as a spider spins its web" repetition works as taught pattern. Minor template cadence in middle sections ("I approached...I placed...I whispered") but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied sentence structures. Excellent momentum through the crater descent sequence. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("gleaming silence of dissolving sodium stars"), slight register drift in peak moments, and one instance of abstract phrasing ("gravity balanced"). The "merged into Kerrin's chest like smoke" metaphor strains physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several issues: template cadence in middle section ("Mara looked... Mara considered... Mara remembered"), some overwriting ("shimmered like a hallucination"), and repetitive sentence openings. The scaffold phrase "Mara had not walked two hundred kilometers to repeat gossip" feels forced. Information density is moderate but could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density in lines like "Together they stood beneath the cobalt glass portico, waiting for the next storm to braid its electricity with her voice."

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("Windborne solace" appears twice identically; "fold in patience" echoes without evolution). Template cadence runs appear ("She had...She felt...She turned...She waited") and some elevated diction drifts from the established register ("tectonic lullaby," "plural accents").

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of exceptional clarity ("brittle corner is crisp as charred parchment") but suffers from occasional abstract drifts ("intersubjective understanding," "harvest measured in empathy"). Some filter-verb accumulation in middle sections ("I ask," "I tell him," "I wonder") disrupts immediacy. Template cadence appears in the "He [verb]" pattern across lines 22-25.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with most lines doing multiple jobs. Vivid selective imagery ("beard laced with salt diamonds," "leaves trembling like unread punctuation"). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats without full payoff (-0.4). Occasional abstract phrasing ("ferocious clarity," "tidal cynicism") that could be more concrete (-0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, but several instances of elevated register drift ("gathering hush," "verdant arbor," "lambent light") that feel forced. Some repetitive phrasing around vines/tendrils. The density is high with most sentences advancing multiple purposes, though occasional overwriting in descriptive passages ("ribbons of dawn light").

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The world above the crater slept, but down here silence walked like an animal alongside him, dragging frost in its fur" simultaneously establishes setting, atmosphere, and Arren's isolation. Some figurative density in places ("breathing shimmer," "patient animal," "cartographer of blood") but each serves the accumulative texture. Minor repetition of "patience/patient" could be trimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density generally high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Each tick harvested an echo, folded it into the coil"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("bruised the sky," "soft map of sound") but serves the lyrical mode. Template cadence appears briefly ("He filed...melted...let") but doesn't pervade. The "peripherally focused" repetition feels purposeful rather than looped.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Bronze plates on the floor separated, revealing a small pit lined with mirrored ore"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("shingled hush, layer upon layer of silenced waves") risks opacity, and occasional abstract phrasing ("meaning resurfaced in living color") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful compression, though figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("Steam had not yet risen, but the water's shift marked the boundary of moments"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some abstract constructions ("hauntingly practical," "here and gone") risk opacity but are grounded through repetition and scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful compression. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "Legend says a person can bargain for direction if they confront the echo of what they could have been." Some elevated register moments ("kinetic lagoon," "fractured stillness") occasionally feel forced but don't obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves solid clarity with purposeful density, though occasional elevated diction ("stoic wonder," "pilgrimage") slightly strains the engineering voice. Strong verb choices ("scuttled," "unfurled," "hissed") create momentum. Some metaphorical density in middle sections ("unfurled like a solar sail") but generally serves the accumulative pattern. Information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    "Excruciatingly gentle" appears four times, creating repetitive phrasing that dulls impact. Some abstract constructions ("bore that hush like a second skin") and elevated register in places. However, sentence variety is strong, momentum maintains through the contemplative pace, and the final image lands cleanly without loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied syntax. However, some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("serene upheaval of minute ripples that parted like curtains"). A few instances of register drift ("hindsight clarity pour through me") slightly muddy immediacy without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("hollow roots of frozen thunder"), though occasional overwriting appears ("Steam rose where lightning had struck, and when I stepped ashore the sand was still glassy warm" could be compressed). Some template cadence in middle sections ("I understood... I pressed... I rowed...") creates minor momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Wind scuttled dry leaves across marble, sounding like distant applause for a play no audience would witness." Some elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "anticipatory elegies") but voice-consistent. No loops or scaffolding, strong propulsion throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments of compression and imagery but suffers from ornamental density and abstract phrasing. Figurative language appears in most sentences without always advancing pressure ("tin halo gnawed by rust," "lullabies," "diamonds on petals"). Template cadence emerges in the litany section ("He spoke of...Of nights...Of living"), and several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("Beauty, he feared, had been filed down" followed by "He yearned to reawaken beauty").

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic control and information density, with varied sentence structures supporting the meditative pace. However, several instances of overwriting appear ("lunar time," "weathered ivy," "glimmering bruise colors") and the metaphor density in peak beats occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density high in descriptive passages. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("luminous skeptic whose eyes glowed"), some abstract phrasing ("municipal neglect"), and slight register drift into elevated diction that doesn't always match the adventure-quest tone. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("The nebula garden drifted like a luminous reef") but occasionally loops concepts ("troubling serenity" appears three times). Information density is high when concrete but thins during abstract passages about memory and patterns. The final image effectively recharges the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance atmosphere or character. Some figurative excess ("spectral mentorship," "thundering calm") and occasional abstraction ("grief of a whole valley could be felt"). The phrase "thundering calm" appears three times, creating mild repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows moments of strong rhythm and imagery but suffers from overwriting—multiple metaphors stack without advancing pressure ("minutes slipped like black sand," "weight peel from the pendulum bob, atom by atom"). Several abstract constructions slow momentum ("Absolution, he knew, could not arrive in a thunderous pardon"). Information density varies widely.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful compression. Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece. Some density issues with figurative language ("rolling like blue velvet," "milk," "beetle," "metronome" in close succession) and occasional abstract phrasing ("intentions lying restless") that could be more concrete. No significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty, but several instances of overwriting ("razor interval," "ossify under too heavy an authorial thumb") and some density issues where figurative language clusters without advancing pressure. The "brass engines clacking through datasets" section particularly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves lyric density with lines doing multiple jobs ("dust was listening" carries both literal and thematic weight). Some overwriting appears ("vowels soft as moss," "syllables wobbling like candleflame over a draught") but rhythm generally supports accumulative structure. Information density is high, though occasional metaphor mixing ("contraband gulls") slightly muddles clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "silence pooled like ink around unfinished canvases." Some overwriting appears in figurative density ("slivered pupil," "filaments thinner than sighs" cluster too tightly). Minor template cadence in "He lifts...He threads...He wipes" sequence. Information density high but occasionally tips into purple territory.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong metaphorical coherence around water/navigation/sedimentation. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Roofs became reefs, avenues became canals"). Minor template cadence in middle section ("He believed...To pry...Thus he agonized") and slight overwriting in "hovering like blurred coordinates neither could chart."

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery like "the rosette at the center...like the hollow of a long-absent instrument seeking strings." Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("denote more than their letters," "across unlearning hatred"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong sensory density and varied syntax. Deductions for occasional overwrought metaphors ("monument to corrosion") and some register drift into technical terminology that slows momentum. The phrase "gentle rebel" appears twice, creating minor redundancy. Information density is high but occasionally tips toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("fermented into that gentle nectar flavor") but doesn't obscure clarity. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in drone awakening sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Paint peeled in scrolls, yet the windows shone with wiped intention"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful figurative language that serves the accumulative mode. Deductions for the abstract "loneliness can carve deeper than knives" and slight overwriting in "hushed blaze licking the timbers."

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, though several instances of abstract phrasing dilute immediacy ("welcomed nuance into a certainty still forming"). Some repetitive constructions around "certainty" and template phrases like "cascading revelations rushed through." The line "a bell we will someday remember" achieves lyric resonance but edges toward precious.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in sequences like "They leapt, clattered, spun, and halted." Information density remains high throughout with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("darker brightness," "boundless confinement") that borders on paradox without full clarity, and some filter constructions ("I felt," "I saw") that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("bathing soil and steam in a tone of saffron quiet"), though occasional overwriting appears ("daydreams...were the only courier still brave enough to cross smog without gasmask"). Sentence variety and rhythm support the accumulative mode effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"The roar of the monumental waterfall muffled the steady drip of fear." Information density is generally strong. Some abstract phrasing ("generosity multiplies itself") and occasional overwriting ("trembling like reeds under the cataract's spray") create minor friction without disrupting momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in "Hours slipped backward; her pocket watch claimed midnight before listing lazily back to dusk." Information density is high without becoming opaque. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("breathing of the tide below") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete, though no loops or scaffolding present.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong figurative control throughout—"mirrors rippled, vomiting watery letters" and "each shred grew luminous"—without overwriting. Sentence variety maintains propulsion through the maze sequence, though occasional abstract constructions ("the repulsive allure we had engineered") momentarily slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dense imagery occasionally overwhelms clarity ("blue hour bled across the horizon like ink in tidal watercolor") but serves the accumulative design. Some metaphor mixing ("wind scratches...skip...composition...vinyl") strains coherence. Information density remains high with lines doing multiple jobs, though "fractal generating spell" and similar constructions edge toward opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("mourning has sharpened my compass into a spike"). Strong rhythm variation and syntactic control. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("grief surges forward") and one instance of elevated diction slightly beyond POV ("symmetric satisfaction").

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, though several abstract constructions weaken immediacy ("compromise whispered," "truth rarely emerges unchallenged"). Information density is high but occasionally tips toward overwriting in metaphorical passages about gilded rot and reopened airways.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The irony stains his pocket like ink"). Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("hush of night ignites inside him," "quiet conflagration") without clear pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in the "One by one" sequence and "He + verb" constructions, though mostly varied.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several abstract constructions weaken momentum: "reclaimed stillness proof against chaos's bark," "alternative hypothesis of courage, inked upon a broken world." The prose sometimes prioritizes poetry over clarity, particularly in emotional beats. Some template phrasing appears ("She reached...She slipped...She surfaced") though not pervasively.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and vivid imagery, with sentences like "Patrons whispered polite tragedies while koi swam through the air like censers leaking color" demonstrating controlled density. However, abstract phrases accumulate ("luminous torment," "quiet catastrophes," "mobile of quiet catastrophes") creating occasional opacity, and some metaphors strain coherence (horizon pivoting like a mobile). The final third maintains clarity through the crane release sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the sky sang with iron." However, several instances of elevated register ("bleak exhilaration spread," "intangibly tangible") and some density issues with figurative language in high-pressure beats. The filter verb "realized" appears at a crucial moment, and there's occasional synonym churn around the energy descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("silence here sounded louder than any engine noise") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("geysered" as verb, "vacant pixel where the screen showed nothing, an absence brighter than existence"). Some template structures appear ("He powered up...slotted...spat") and filter constructions accumulate in places. The final third maintains better momentum despite dense imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("figurines floated upright on the tide like mourners") with varied sentence structure, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("sifted, sieved hush"). Information density is generally high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements, though occasional ornamental phrases don't fully earn their space.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong atmospheric density but shows template cadence in "Mara [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Information density is high—most sentences advance both atmosphere and story—though some metaphors strain ("ventricles" for staircases).

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of excellence ("barnacles drip silver tears," "whistle slipped through Gideon's teeth") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("erected the backlash of regrets") and abstract phrasing ("gravitating toward love"). The lightning sequence maintains propulsion, though some metaphors strain ("drunken soldiers deserting their posts"). Information density generally strong with minimal scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("memory stains still pulsed behind my eyes like bruised stars") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently in high-pressure beats. Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle clarity ("lace forged from engine grease"), and some passages contain near-paraphrase loops that could be compressed for momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of genuine beauty ("Moonlight intensified, no longer aloof but intimate") but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Several mixed metaphors ("grief folds destinies the way wind folds wings"). Template cadence appears in lines 17-20 with repeated "I/My [verb]" structures. Some overwrought phrases ("cosmic intimacy," "galaxies blossoming") create register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without always advancing pressure. Mixed metaphors ("bruised silk," "moonlight bruising") create minor coherence friction. Template patterns visible in "willingly perplexed" repetition and some paraphrase loops around time/memory concepts detract from otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("griffin floated...like an errant feather," "grief to drown a star") but occasionally overreaches. Some abstract scaffolding around "shadow work" and "the Action, capital A" could be more concrete. Information density is high, with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("stars seem to swap partners behind thin clouds") with varied sentence structures. Information density is generally high, with lines doing multiple jobs. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("transformation is not a moment...it is a conversation" followed by extended rumination on the same concept) and occasional overwriting in figurative language dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong prose rhythm with varied sentence structures and purposeful figurative language that advances the story. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("rumour insisted that no latch born of iron could ignore her whisper") and some template phrasing in the middle section, but information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong imagery and varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears ("luminous columns that wrote sentences across clouds"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrases like "hemispheres of the soul" lack grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most high-pressure sentences without clear payoff ("furiously tranquil" repeats without evolution). Some passages loop conceptually ("the pause had taught him the grammar of thunder and the syntax of broken skin") and occasional register drift into abstract philosophy dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows ambition with vivid imagery but suffers from overwriting in places ("diplomatically fierce as a treaty carved in ice"). Some metaphor density issues and elevated register that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies. Template cadence appears in middle sections. Information density is good when not overwhelmed by figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"rattling like a cage full of pennies and promises" combines sound, object, and theme. Some metaphor density in peak beats ("seeds...rooted in floorboards, prying up rot to birth green punctuation") but pattern-taught and purposeful. Clean propulsion throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though some metaphorical density approaches oversaturation ("Steely longing pooled behind his eyes"). Minor template cadence in the arbor sequence ("He imagined... He played... He understood"). Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple purposes. Deduction for occasional abstract phrasing that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good sentence variety and rhythm. Strong opening and closing lines. Some overwriting in figurative language ("library built of rain") and occasional abstract phrasing ("luminous and translucent"). Minor template cadence in dream sequence descriptions. Information density is good but could be tighter in places.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks that control pacing. Information density is high—"The miniature pine wore beads of fresh rain like penitents on its needles" layers description with thematic resonance. Minor repetition of "rhythmically placid" and occasional overwrought metaphors ("spiral stair carved from coral and sorrow") slightly diminish clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (e.g., "matter preprocesses reality"). No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues. Syntax varies naturally, and the final line resonates without artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and advance multiple elements of story and character simultaneously. There is no evidence of loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle. The closing paragraphs are particularly strong, with a cadence that perfectly mirrors the thematic resolution of "cooled glass."

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight figurative overload in a high-pressure beat (e.g., "pain like molten snow"), which creates a momentary muddle. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are maintained, with no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains propulsion and clarity. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative drive. A minor rhythm stumble occurs in the phrase “occupying impossible spaces so the living world could stay lightened,” which feels slightly less polished than the surrounding text, but this is a hairline slip that does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and poetic, purposeful phrasing. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats ("hearts clanging like hidden bells") which momentarily slightly obscures clarity, though the closure image remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent, serving the accumulative drive. A minor synonym churn ("ache of absence," "vision hurt") appears but does not touch the closure beat or obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly inventive, but slight density issues emerge in high-pressure beats (e.g., "photographs developing in reverse"). A minor figurative overload slightly obscures immediacy without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains clarity and propulsion, with sentences advancing multiple jobs. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("patience was not the absence of urgency but the harness"). A minor deduction for slightly ornate phrasing in high-pressure beats ("sweat pooled in the hollows of her collarbones"), but no loops, scaffold, or muddle obscure closure. Rhythm varies naturally to support scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, poetic, and largely effective, though a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "cells divide unseen") creates minor moments of opacity that do not fundamentally harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without obscuring clarity or momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure ("liquid ladders," "constellations"). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating with the release of the moonbeams. Zero loops or scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("landscapes and people revealed cracks," "sunlight spilled... christening the newborn dome"). Sentence-level propulsion is flawless, varying rhythm to match the action, from the careful description of glassblowing to the energetic closing lines. A masterclass in line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in "identity could be edited again," which feels slightly analytical for the peak of the crisis, though it is quickly grounded again.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush and highly poetic, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, a tendency toward overwriting emerges in high-pressure beats, with figurative language appearing in most sentences ("coals burned like cindered rubies," "dust that glimmered like ground pearls"). This creates minor density without always advancing pressure, though it never fully obscures causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor register drift occurs in the phrase "stellar silence," which feels slightly elevated for Janus's lexicon, but it does not obscure closure. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere without scaffold or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.8)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and legible, even in peak beats (e.g., "shelves swung like silent jury boxes"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. Syntax and word choice are precise and vivid, advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistently sharp and purposeful ("reducing planets to axioms"). Rhythm is controlled and varies naturally, accelerating with the garden's shift and breathing into the resonant closure. The final line is a masterclass in textural specificity and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is largely effective and coherent, though a slight density in the opening ("painting the night with an icy warmth that stung yet soothed") borders on overwriting without major harm. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, evocative, and highly polished, with strong rhythm and sentence-level propulsion. A minor tendency toward similar sentence lengths in the opening paragraphs creates a slight rhythmic uniformity, preventing a perfect score, but there are no artifacts harming clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly polished, with virtually no scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and expertly woven into the narrative texture without muddying clarity. A single, minor artifact: the phrase "dormouse heart under leaves" is a slightly ornate metaphor in an otherwise perfectly calibrated sentence, creating a tiny stumble in rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("rosary for machinery"). No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs. Read-aloud ear test is superb.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is consistently sharp and coherent. A minor syntactic monotony appears in one beat ("I unfolded, refolded, and the corridors unfolded with me"), but this is a hairline slip that does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and varied sentence structures. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, though occasional phrases like "softly adaptive melodies" edge toward slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat. No loops or scaffold artifacts; clarity and momentum are maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and heightens clarity. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing in perfect step with the scene's needs, particularly in the climactic realization.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is flawless, achieving high information density and rhythmic propulsion without a single artifact. Figurative language is consistent, inventive, and perfectly integrated ("wind scraped the rocky island like a file on bone"). Every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot with concision and power.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is breathtakingly dense and precise, with every sentence performing multiple jobs of advancing plot, deepening character, and enriching atmosphere. Figurative language is complex yet coherent, with patterns taught and paid off (e.g., architectural and artistic motifs). Rhythm is masterfully controlled, accelerating and slowing with the scene's needs. A single potential artifact—"decorates with silence" appears twice—but this is a purposeful reprise that charges the closure, not a loop.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exemplary with high information density and poetic propulsion. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "subdued cracks that harmonized rather than threatened" feels slightly explanatory). However, clarity is never obscured, and the closure beat is flawlessly executed.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs with "darkening brightness," a paradoxical image that is slightly strained and requires extra cognitive load to resolve, though it ultimately serves the theme. This minor artifact in a peak beat prevents a higher score. Otherwise, the line-level craft is flawless and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences accelerate and breathe with scene needs ("The drum maker had promised one, forged around a filament of hush"). Minor deduction for a slight register drift in "impossible possibility," which feels slightly abstract against the concrete texture. However, no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and varied syntax. Minor figurative overreach in "thunder rolled like marble across cathedral floors" slightly strains the established voice. Otherwise, no artifacts or loops; momentum is well-maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is luminous and virtually flawless. Sentences are propulsive and dense, doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously.

== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is of an extremely high caliber, marked by precision, information density, and stunning figurative language ("mud sucking at their boots in wet applause"). It is held back from a higher score by a couple of minor dissonances. The phrase "preprocesses reality" feels like an un-integrated piece of academic jargon in an otherwise poetic text. Similarly, the sentence summarizing a future action ("She would later feed the atlas into a model...") slightly disrupts the powerful in-scene immediacy of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, demonstrating high information density and syntactic variety. The figurative language is often striking and purposeful, particularly when linking Yara's craft to her experience. However, a few moments verge on being overwritten, with a density of metaphor that slightly slows the momentum, and the final line ("glass, once cooled, never doubts the shape it has chosen") feels like a well-worn aphorism that lessens the impact of the preceding, stronger images.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and evocative, precise language. Figurative language is consistently inventive and coherent, serving to build the unique atmosphere without ever feeling overwritten ("ocean...a black wall embalmed by perpetual polar auroras").

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense with strong imagery, but it sometimes sacrifices concision for lyricism, leading to moments of overwriting. For instance, the simile "vibrations shiver through support beams like distant drum rolls announcing dawn" feels slightly overwrought in a moment of high tension. The repetition of a key phrase ("staggering grace") is a noticeable artifact that should have been caught in a final polish.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with dense, evocative prose and a confident rhythm. However, a couple of moments slightly mar the perfection. The line "While cells divide unseen" feels abstract and tonally dissonant, and the final paragraph's thematic declarations are a touch too explicit. These are minor slips but they momentarily break the spell of an otherwise immaculate piece.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, with high information density in every line.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, with high information density and a controlled, lyrical rhythm. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, such as twilight sliding down the walls "like a slow sigh." There are no technical faults, loops, or scaffolding. The only minor blemish is the final paragraph's aphoristic summary of the theme, which feels slightly less crafted than the evocative, action-driven prose that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense with imagery, demonstrating high craft. Sentences are constructed with a strong sense of rhythm and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is ambitious and consistently beautiful, with stunningly inventive figurative language ("silhouettes stacking like translucent pages of a flipbook").

There are no loops or scaffold; every line works to propel the narrative forward with a deliberate, melancholic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and purposeful, resonant figurative language. Metaphors like "ungreased gears of time" and the climactic feeling of being "somewhere between prayer and audit" are not decorative but structural. The prose is clean, propulsive, and entirely free of loops or scaffolding, driving the narrative with precision and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense with striking, original metaphors ("hallway mouths yawning like patient graves," "time shed scales like a molting serpent") that build a cohesive world. The sentence rhythm is controlled and purposeful, accelerating and decelerating with the narrative's pulse. While the figurative language is pervasive, it rarely feels overwritten, instead contributing to the story’s dreamlike momentum and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong, with evocative and precise language. However, a few moments of overwriting slightly dull the impact, such as the metaphor of "stitching the world into one listening body." The final two paragraphs, while thematically sound, have a slightly more explanatory, less immediate prose style than the rest of the piece, feeling like a summary of the event's resonance rather than a continuation of the embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently lyrical and demonstrates a high level of craft, with strong verbs and evocative, specific imagery ("moth wings arrested mid-flight"). However, the figurative density is relentless, occasionally bordering on overwritten, as in "the fragile ash would interpret her heartbeat as a gust." While this density creates a powerful atmosphere, a few more moments of plainer language might have provided beneficial contrast and prevented the poetic texture from feeling uniformly applied.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and startlingly precise imagery. Sentences like "Wind scraped the rocky island like a file on bone" and "Light rivered along the teak courses" are both beautiful and functional, advancing atmosphere and action simultaneously. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the prose is a polished, propulsive instrument that serves the story's ambitious concept flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is the story's defining feature: dense, musical, and highly original. While the figurative language is consistently stunning, its sheer density borders on overwriting in a few places. More critically, several sentences in the final paragraphs shift from showing to summarizing intent or theme ("each cadence a promise..."), a slight scaffolding that briefly interrupts the otherwise superb momentum and immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is exquisite, marked by rhythmic variety and high information density. However, the prose verges on overwriting during the climactic sequence. The rapid stacking of similes and metaphors ("drowsy eyes," "translucent veils," "restless page") is beautiful but so dense that it risks overwhelming the moment, a hairline flaw in an otherwise masterful performance.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional craft, with high information density and rhythmic variety that propels the abstract narrative forward. Figurative language is consistently inventive and purposeful, avoiding cliché and rarely feeling overwrought. There are no discernible loops or scaffolding; each sentence carries its own weight, contributing to a polished and propulsive reading experience from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density, with figurative language that is both original and purposeful ("starlight chipped from midnight glass"). Sentence structure and rhythm are varied to create a compelling, incantatory momentum that never falters. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no discernible loops, scaffolding, or overwriting, even in its most poetic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and evocative, with powerful imagery like "thunder rolled like marble across cathedral floors." The rhythm is controlled, and the word choice is consistently precise, creating momentum and atmosphere simultaneously. There are no notable loops or artifacts; every sentence serves a purpose. A few figurative phrases, like "magnetic filings against her ribs," are slightly less fresh than the surrounding prose but do not detract from the overall high quality.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is luminous and polished, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the figurative language is so consistently dense that it occasionally slows momentum, especially in moments of rising action. While beautiful, this tendency toward overwriting creates a uniform texture that slightly muffles the dynamic shifts in tension required at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is consistently beautiful and evocative, with high information density in nearly every line. However, its relentless lyricism borders on being overwrought; the density of figurative language is so high that it slightly muffles the story's momentum at times. While a justifiable choice for a poet's POV, a demanding editor would note that this unrelenting richness leaves little room for stylistic variance to emphasize key beats, resulting in a minor deduction for overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and evocative imagery ("rusted ribs of hulls like broken harps"). There are no textual artifacts, loops, or redundancies. While the figurative language is dense, it feels purposeful and earned within the lyrical mode. A handful of phrases lean toward abstraction (e.g., "Magnificent simplicity guided each step"), but they are consistent with the established voice and do not detract from momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by inventive, vivid imagery ("suspended hourglass," "coins the color of moon bruises," "mineral applause"). While the language is consistently dense and figurative, it achieves a cohesive, atmospheric texture that serves the story's speculative-noir tone. There are no technical flaws, loops, or redundancies; every sentence works to build the unique world and the narrator's perspective, demonstrating remarkable control and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean but prone to overwriting, with dense clusters of adjectives ("shrewd seaside cargo broker," "humid Thursday night") that slow momentum. There are moments of effective lyricism, but also several cliché similes that dull the impact. A key artifact is the template-like quality of some descriptions, suggesting a response to prompts rather than organic scene-building, which slightly flattens the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is luminous and dense, yet it maintains clarity and momentum. Figurative language is consistently inventive and precise, as in "shine like bottled rain" or the arbor "breathing aurora." While the style is highly lyrical, it does not become overwrought or obscure the action, particularly at the climax. Every sentence serves character, atmosphere, or forward motion, demonstrating exceptional economy and craft.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, elegant, and propelled by strong, specific language. Figurative language is not ornamental but is the primary engine of world-building and atmosphere ("snoring hurricanes into subway tunnels," "silence clapped shut like a sketchbook"). The piece is exceptionally clean, with no wasted words, scaffold, or loops, demonstrating masterful control at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic grace in every line. Figurative language is consistently inventive and purposeful, as in "parabolas resembling smiles and integrals descending like sighs." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the piece is a masterclass in concision and propulsion, with a final sentence that perfectly captures the story’s thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and demonstrates exceptional line-level craft with high information density and rhythmic variety. While the figurative language is consistently dense, it almost always serves the story's textural mode and unique voice without becoming overwrought. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; each sentence propels the quiet narrative forward with grace and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, fresh figurative language, and a complete absence of scaffolding or prose artifacts. Each sentence propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere without a wasted word. The prose is rich and dense but never overwrought, maintaining clarity even in its most poetic moments, such as the description of the leaf's veins as "hidden pathways plants keep secret from impatient eyes."

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, characterized by high information density and evocative, precise imagery. While the figurative language is consistently ambitious ("living chiaroscuro of longing"), it largely avoids becoming overwrought and serves the story's magical-realist tone. There are no wasted sentences, and the rhythm propels the narrative with a confident, lyrical momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is masterful and the story’s greatest strength. The prose is dense with evocative, precise figurative language that avoids cliché and builds the story's unique atmosphere. Sentences like "Sound exploded without noise; instead colors rang, scents chimed..." are both beautiful and functional, advancing the plot through sensory experience. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and consistently inventive figurative language ("patch the wind," "weaving rain with wire"). The prose risks being overwrought but avoids it through specificity and control. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or scaffold sentences; every line propels the story's accumulative purpose. The rhythm and syntax are varied and artfully controlled, especially in the final, resonant paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery ("half open like a sigh," "ribbon of silver rail"). The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, propelling the narrative forward. The primary weakness is a handful of lines that state what has just been shown, such as "cartographer and cartography fused," which feels like scaffolding. This tendency toward direct explanation, especially near the end, slightly dulls the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    While the prose is often lyrical and precise, it is marred by occasional abstract jargon ("sculpt space for reflection") and, most critically, by the summarizing nature of the final paragraphs. These closing sentences have a scaffold-like quality, explaining the story's meaning rather than letting the final actions resonate. This dilutes the impact of an otherwise strong piece, representing a loss of momentum at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and evocative figurative language that consistently serves the story's tone and themes. The recurring motif of "thunder" and "hush" is used as a deliberate, unifying device that works effectively. There are no wasted words, and the sentence-level propulsion is excellent, modulating perfectly with the scene's rising and falling tension. The line-work is clean, precise, and demonstrates a rare level of polish.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates superb rhythmic control. Figurative language is strong and purposeful, creating a unique texture. The piece is marred only slightly by the final paragraph's tendency to state its theme directly, a minor lapse into telling that momentarily breaks the spell of an otherwise immaculately shown story.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and evocative, original figurative language ("thunder butterflies," "a filament's prayer"). The prose is lush but never overwritten; every sentence serves to advance the story's atmosphere and action. The rhythm is controlled and varied, demonstrating a masterful ear for sentence-level propulsion without any loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is superb, with high information density and evocative, precise imagery ("waves slap steel hulls like closing file drawers"). The prose is rhythmic and controlled, avoiding clutter or redundancy. The only slight weakness is a tendency toward aphoristic statements in the final third, which, while thematically consistent, create a minor register shift away from the purely embodied voice that dominates the rest of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is ambitious, dense with figurative language that, for the most part, works exceptionally well to build a unique atmosphere. A few phrases verge on being overwrought ("glowing breadcrumbs toward truth"), but the overall control is so strong that they integrate into the story's lyrical, heightened reality. The sentence structure is varied and propulsive, with no discernible loops or scaffolding, resulting in a polished and immersive read.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong, characterized by high information density and evocative imagery. The prose propels the narrative forward efficiently, especially in the opening. However, the story's summary-like structure sometimes results in sentences that tell rather than show, such as "my orderly intuitive nature nudged me to reorganize our next steps," which reads more like a report than an immersive, in-the-moment experience, slightly flattening the prose rhythm in the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its descriptions of the plume. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the "slow-motion parade" of the eruption, creating a hypnotic effect. Word choice is precise and evocative ("umber light," "lullaby cadence"). The piece is exceptionally clean, with no significant overwriting or scaffolding to distract from the story's quiet power.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and evocative imagery ("tiny eclipses of warmth"). The rhythm of the sentences effectively mirrors the calm, focused action. While the figurative language is consistently rich and beautiful, its sheer density occasionally verges on becoming ornamental, a minor point of friction in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous and economical, exhibiting high information density in every line. Figurative language is fresh and precise ("radiant as lightning paused midflash," "gravity shrugged"), enhancing atmosphere without distracting. Sentence rhythm is expertly controlled, varying with the scene's tension. The piece is entirely free of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts, demonstrating a clean and confident authorial hand.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense with striking imagery. However, a few lines drift towards authorial explanation, slightly breaking the otherwise immersive spell. The sentence, "Change traveled via the rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones, invisible yet certain," feels like a thematic summary that could have been left implicit. While the majority of the prose is exceptional, these minor instances of telling over showing prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and confident, with high information density and striking imagery. However, there is a recurring prose artifact: the phrase “overriding instinct” is used twice in key moments, functioning as a repetitive scaffold. The density of figurative language, while often beautiful, occasionally feels overwrought for a high-tension scene, slightly dulling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and rhythmically controlled, achieving a high information density without sacrificing momentum. Figurative language, such as "shadows whispered into tidy corridors," is consistently purposeful and effective. The piece is free of scaffolding or loops, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft and a strong read-aloud ear.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and highly ambitious, operating at an extremely high level of craft. The language is consistently inventive and precise, with powerful verbs and specific, sensory nouns creating a vivid texture. The story narrowly avoids being overwritten because the lushness serves the otherworldly atmosphere. A minor deduction is warranted for a few instances where a concept is labeled just before or after it is shown (e.g., "lovingly venomous"), which creates a slight redundancy in an otherwise seamless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and imagistically dense, with strong, purposeful sentences. The rhythm and syntax support the mythic tone effectively. Minor weaknesses include the repetition of the phrase "hauntingly optimistic" and a tendency toward summarizing a character's motive or knowledge in declarative statements, such as in the final sentence, which slightly dilutes the power of the preceding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and dense with striking imagery ("fruit fall like muted bells," "skulls that smirked like theatrical masks"). While the figurative language is overwhelmingly successful, a few moments verge on being overly lush, slightly dulling the momentum. For instance, the dream reveal of "palms smeared with loam" feels a touch more convenient and less elegant than the rest of the prose, but this is a minor blemish on an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is a standout strength, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is rich and inventive ("voice cracking like an old phonograph," "molten gold cooling into typeface") and consistently supports the story's atmosphere. While dense with imagery, it avoids becoming overwrought, and there are no discernible loops, scaffolds, or other prose artifacts to stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with very few wasted words. However, the final sentence—"preserving the echoed silence until she returned victorious"—is a notable flaw. It breaks from the established voice and tension, offering a jarring, summary-like promise of success that deflates the powerful ambiguity of the Charged Poise ending. While the rest of the line-level craft is exceptional, this slip at the story's cadence point prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and largely successful, with high information density in every line. However, the sheer saturation of figurative language occasionally borders on overwriting. Phrases like "spilled crescent and raw" push the lyrical style to its limit. While the effect is powerful and consistent with the voice, a touch more restraint in peak moments would elevate it from exceptional to flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and dense with precisely rendered images, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft. Most sentences perform multiple functions, advancing character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. A minor penalty is applied for one instance of a paraphrase loop ("My actual mission...was to graft new meaning... / Words sometimes suture..."), a small redundancy in an otherwise immaculate piece.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense with vivid, purposeful imagery, and the sentence-level rhythm supports the story's pensive mood. The piece avoids major overwriting despite its lyrical density. There are a few instances of stock poetic phrasing ("hush between heartbeats," "shy bird"), but these are minor compared to the overall strength of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is ambitious, dense with figurative language that consistently supports the story's otherworldly atmosphere. While walking a fine line, it avoids becoming overwritten, as the metaphors are coherent and propel the narrative forward (e.g., sound weaving "invisible stitches"). The piece is impeccably clean, with no loops, scaffolding, or rhythmic monotony, resulting in a polished and propulsive style.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates exceptional control. While rich with figurative language ("drones... whining like oversized hornets," "optics read only liquid silence"), it rarely feels overwritten, instead adding texture and meaning to the high-pressure beats. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, showcasing high information density and sentence-level propulsion that carries the reader effortlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, a high-risk strategy that succeeds due to its consistency and precision. The piece teaches its own lyrical logic from the first sentence, so the richness feels intentional rather than overwritten. Sentence structure is varied, word choice is surprising and exact ("contraband comfort," "luminous armor"), and the piece is free of technical errors or momentum-killing loops.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense with striking imagery. However, a minor prose artifact slightly dulls momentum. The lines, "Their collective hush formed what curators called the museum of extinct feelings. Across the museum of extinct feelings, she heard a hush..." create a small paraphrase loop. While the rest of the prose is exceptionally clean and propulsive, this moment of slight redundancy prevents a perfect score in an otherwise masterful piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the story's momentum, breathing during moments of discovery and quickening during moments of risk. A few phrases lean towards being slightly overwritten ("abyssal in implication," "shimmering like quiet thunder"), but these are minor and do not detract from the overall propulsion and clarity of the excellent line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often lyrical, contributing significantly to the atmosphere. However, it occasionally strays into overwriting, with figurative language that is beautiful but slightly clutters high-pressure moments. A few minor paraphrase loops exist, such as the line defining "encrypted compassion," which slightly dulls the momentum but does not derail the story's powerful effect.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density, syntactic variety, and powerful, unforced figurative language. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to advance character, atmosphere, or the accumulative pressure. The piece is exceptionally polished and rhythmically controlled from the first line to the last.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional craft and information density, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. While the figurative language is extremely rich, it avoids becoming overwrought or obscuring meaning, instead building a cohesive and powerful atmosphere. The rhythm is controlled, varied, and propulsive, with zero evidence of scaffolding, loops, or other prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose demonstrates high craft, but it suffers from a relentless density of figurative language that occasionally feels overwrought, slightly dulling the impact of individual images. In high-pressure moments near the climax, this density works against the scene's velocity where greater concision would be more powerful. This constitutes a minor but consistent drag on momentum, preventing an otherwise excellent piece from achieving full clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and imaginative, with a high information density and varied syntax. However, the density of figurative language is exceptionally high, verging on overwriting in key moments. The climactic fusion of emotions ("sorrow with honey-yellow hope, fear with silver curiosity") is beautiful but highly ornate, a stylistic choice that slightly encumbers the action with its richness, warranting a small deduction for an otherwise polished performance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and highly polished, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft. While the figurative language is dense, it is consistently purposeful, advancing atmosphere and theme without becoming overwrought or obscuring clarity. Sentences are syntactically varied, information-rich, and propelled by a confident rhythm. There are no discernible loops, redundancies, or artifacts; every word serves the story's tightly controlled, magical effect.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is the story's crown jewel: dense, evocative, and flawlessly controlled. Every sentence works to advance atmosphere, character, or action, with high information density and no wasted words. Figurative language, such as "chimneys inhaled brackish night" and "elation rose like moonlight," is consistently fresh and potent, enhancing rather than obscuring the story's momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("sang through them, turning error into aperture"). The sentence structure is varied, and the rhythm supports the story's reflective, magical tone. While there are no significant technical flaws like loops or scaffolds, the high density of figurative language occasionally feels overwrought, with a few phrases ("silver breath," "unspooling threads of salt") bordering on cliché for this level of literary prose.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently elegant and imagistic, with high information density ("pooling over ashes like milk over ink"). The primary flaw is a conceptual paraphrase loop in the lead-up to the climax, where three consecutive sentences restate the idea of translating pain ("map toward meaning," "root language," "universal language"). This redundancy briefly stalls momentum and is the only significant artifact in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density and precise, evocative word choice ("tide-sculpted mathematics," "waves curling like brackets"). While the density of figurative language is consistently high, it avoids becoming overwriting by remaining purposeful and tethered to the character's worldview. Crucially, the prose becomes more direct and functional at the story's climax, demonstrating remarkable control and preventing any potential for ornamental clutter to obscure the key action.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and largely successful, with powerful imagery and varied syntax that propels the narrative. Lines like "brittle paper to sigh into dust" demonstrate high-level craft. While the figurative language is consistently rich, it verges on becoming overwrought in a few places, but it never obscures clarity or momentum at pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by exquisite word choice ("pigment-syllable," "scrying surface") and elegant, propulsive syntax. The high density of figurative language is a deliberate and successful stylistic choice that establishes the story's magical realist tone, rather than feeling like overwriting. The prose is clean, with no discernible loops or scaffolding, creating a seamless and immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, rhythmic control, and evocative imagery. Sentences like "Rourke exhaled, brass fingers opening, and signed beside Laure, the metal ink scoring the parchment like soft thunder" are both beautiful and propulsive. While the density of similes approaches a stylistic tic, it remains consistent and effective, avoiding clutter even in the peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is ambitious, dense with figurative language that largely succeeds in creating a mythic atmosphere. While a few phrases like "refrigerated hope" or the personification of "the philanthropist within her" are slightly overwrought, the overall quality is outstanding. The rhythm is controlled, propulsion is excellent, and there are no technical errors or momentum-draining artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with high information density and powerful imagery. However, a few phrases like "bodily poetic presence" and "impossibly deliberate" are abstract conceptual labels that slightly dilute the otherwise concrete sensory detail. While the overall effect is potent, these minor instances of telling rather than showing in an otherwise impeccably rendered piece prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and resonant figurative language that is always purposeful. Lines like "He learned to measure silence like ink" are both beautiful and thematically central. The piece is entirely free of line-level artifacts, loops, or overwriting, demonstrating superb control and polish from the first sentence to the last.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, demonstrating high information density, syntactic variety, and masterful use of figurative language without a hint of overwriting. Every line serves a purpose, advancing plot, character, or atmosphere with precision and grace. The piece is free of any scaffolding, loops, or artifacts; the rhythm and clarity are impeccable, particularly during the climactic rite, where the language becomes almost incantatory.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates exceptional control at the line level, with zero evidence of scaffolding or redundancy. Each sentence carries significant weight. While the high degree of figurative language ("snowmelt ardor") borders on overwriting in a few spots, it remains consistent with the established mythic tone and never obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is superb. The prose is dense, lyrical, and propelled by strong, specific verbs and evocative imagery without ever feeling overwritten. Sentences like "The air tastes of copper and wet leaves, equal parts omen and invitation" do immense work in a small space. The piece is free of scaffolding or rhythmic monotony, demonstrating a masterful control of language that serves the story at every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently luminous and demonstrates high information density. However, the figurative language is so uniformly dense that it occasionally verges on overwriting, especially during the climax. While the effect is powerful, a few moments could achieve greater impact with more restraint, allowing key images to stand out more sharply against a slightly plainer canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.9)
    The prose is of the highest caliber, marked by high information density, striking figurative language ("rattling like a tooth in a skull"), and rhythmic precision. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to build atmosphere, reveal character, or advance the emotional state of the scene. The line-level craft is flawless and propels the narrative with grace and power.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and highly crafted, with strong verbs and precise imagery. However, the density of figurative language is extremely high, with similes and metaphors appearing in nearly every other sentence in the first half. While the quality of the figures is consistently high (e.g., "unfinished mouth waiting for a word"), the sheer volume verges on overwriting and slightly impedes momentum before the central action takes over. This density is the story's only notable, albeit minor, vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates high-level craft. However, the figurative language, while often stunning, is so dense it occasionally risks becoming overwrought, slightly impeding momentum. A line like "accidental wisdom perched quietly beside them" verges on abstraction in a story otherwise grounded in concrete imagery. While the overall effect is powerful, a slightly more restrained hand in a few key moments would have elevated it further.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density and precise, evocative language. Figurative language is consistently strong and integral to the story's meaning, such as "futures parenting the past" or breath crystallizing into punctuation. The prose avoids overwriting and scaffolding, maintaining momentum through its elegant syntax and carefully chosen vocabulary. It demonstrates a very high level of polish.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and frequently stunning, with inventive figurative language like "bronze vowels" and "footnotes that ripple like kelp." While the sheer density of metaphor occasionally verges on becoming overwritten, it remains coherent and serves the story's high-concept, lyrical tone. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, propelling the narrative forward despite the complexity of the ideas. The story is free of technical errors or clumsy phrasing, showcasing a high level of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently strong, with vivid, inventive figurative language and a compelling rhythm. Sentences are information-dense and propel the story forward effectively. While the high density of metaphors is a defining feature of the voice, it occasionally risks becoming overwriting, for example in "smiles blissfully aberrant and slightly smeared, as though time kept editing its own brushstrokes." However, this density never obscures clarity, especially in the clean, powerful execution of the climax and resolution, where the language becomes more direct and active.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative. Word choice is precise and imagery is strong. The piece suffers from one distinct prose artifact that prevents a 9+ score: a paraphrase loop ("To merge artifact and engine, she must speak in rope. / She would translate through motion, by reconfiguring the braids..."). While minor, this momentary redundancy in a story of such high caliber is noticeable. Otherwise, the line-level craft is superb, with excellent rhythm and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and vivid, original figurative language ("a hush like beaten metal settling over an anvil," "cracks radiated outward like tidal charts"). The sentences are propelled by strong verbs and precise imagery, avoiding any discernible loops or scaffolding. While the style is dense, it remains clear and purposeful, never sacrificing momentum for ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and almost entirely free of artifacts. The elevated, figurative language is a deliberate and consistent stylistic choice that builds the world's atmosphere without obscuring clarity. Sentences are rhythmically varied and propelled by strong verbs, achieving high information density on every line. The piece demonstrates a masterful command of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious and largely brilliant, with high information density and evocative imagery. Sentences like "thunder unrolled a deepening hush" demonstrate superb craft. However, the density of figurative language occasionally borders on being overwrought, and a slight redundancy ("whispering forecourt after rain") is noticeable, preventing a perfect score but not significantly detracting from the story's power.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and powerful, precise imagery. The prose is poetic without sacrificing clarity or momentum, creating a propulsive and immersive reading experience. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or the advancement of the plot, culminating in the perfectly executed final line.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is ornate and often stunning, with high information density and powerful, specific imagery. However, the prose is so consistently figurative that it occasionally feels overwritten, particularly in the closing paragraphs ("cosmic hesitations," "patient discourse on becoming"). A demanding editor would note this extreme density as a point for refinement, as it risks blunting the impact of key moments. Despite this, the piece is free of technical errors, loops, or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous and dense with meaning, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. Figurative language is inventive and consistent with the story’s tone ("sound drained, splashing around my ankles"). The momentum is expertly controlled. A minor deduction is warranted for the penultimate paragraph's thematic summary ("The hush had taught him..."), which momentarily shifts from showing to telling and slightly flattens the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb. The prose is dense with original, coherent metaphors ("dark velvet shaken across chandeliers," "ink stained her fingertips like dusk stains clouds") that enhance atmosphere without obscuring clarity. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied and propulsive, creating the "hush" the story describes. There are no wasted words or distracting prose artifacts; every line serves character, setting, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its high density of figurative language ("digital snow," "augmented reality confetti," "ionic haze") occasionally borders on overwriting, slightly impeding momentum. While many images are striking, their sheer volume can feel stacked. A few phrases, like "sunrise had become sunrise fulfilled," are slightly awkward and could benefit from greater concision and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is exquisite, with high information density and a powerful, varied rhythm. The sheer density of figurative language, especially in the opening, verges on overwriting but ultimately succeeds as a deliberate, high-risk stylistic choice that establishes the story's voice. The piece is free of technical flaws, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating a masterful command of line-level craft under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its high information density sometimes leads to overwriting. The sustained use of elevated, figurative language in nearly every sentence ("shadowseam wonder," "basalt heart," "tectonic beats," "oblivion's dark") can slightly dull the impact of individual images through sheer volume. While the rhythm is controlled, a more varied texture with plainer language to offset the lyrical peaks would heighten the power of key moments. The craft is strong, but lacks the final polish of restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is rich and highly stylized, demonstrating exceptional control of rhythm and figurative language. While dense with imagery ("thoughtful cats," "midnight trumpet," "caged thunder"), it rarely falters and consistently serves the story's tone and momentum. The information density is high, with virtually no wasted words, and the final line provides a perfect, symmetrical closure to the opening image.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional craft and information density without sacrificing clarity. While the figurative language is dense, it is the story's taught mode of logic and never becomes ornamental. The rhythm is controlled, and the piece is free of loops or scaffolding, culminating in a final line that resolves through a powerful, concise image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, with high information density in nearly every line ("anxious paper," "bruise of constant relocation"). Figurative language is powerful and integrated, such as the pulse kicking "like a runaway stamp." A single phrase, "parliamentary authority," feels slightly out of register for the character's internal thought, a very minor slip in an otherwise flawless execution. There are no loops or wasted words.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is overwhelmingly strong, with high information density and evocative, precise language ("gilt halos," "shuddered," "withered"). However, the density of figurative language is relentless, at times bordering on overwriting. Lines like "their amber glow sketched rippling constellations across the water skins" and "each blade a coded freedom insisting on its own shimmer" are beautiful but their sheer frequency slightly dilutes the impact of any single image. This is a hairline flaw in an otherwise masterful performance.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is stunningly lyrical and dense with imagery ("fog blossomed from the bell like pale lilies," "stalactites shimmered like tuning forks"). While the figurative language is consistently high-quality, its sheer density approaches the edge of being overwritten, with nearly every sentence carrying a metaphor or simile. This density, while beautiful, slightly tempers the propulsion in a few spots, but it never obscures clarity or harms the magnificent closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and dense with imagery, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft. While the figurative language is consistently high-quality, its sheer density in the opening paragraphs borders on overwhelming, slightly slowing the initial momentum before it finds its rhythm. However, there are no technical flaws, loops, or clichés, and the language at the climax is perfectly calibrated for clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmically controlled, with virtually every sentence performing multiple functions of advancing plot, building atmosphere, and revealing character. Figurative language is rich but always purposeful, avoiding any sense of ornamentation. There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolds; the line-level craft is polished to a very high standard.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of a very high literary quality, with dense, evocative imagery and a strong, varied rhythm. Figurative language, such as "the clang of cooling iron echoed like a heartbeat too tired to continue," is both beautiful and functional. The piece is remarkably clean, with no discernible scaffolding or line-level artifacts to dull its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently strong, with high information density and evocative figurative language. While the style is very rich and occasionally borders on ornate, it maintains clarity and propulsion, especially in the climactic beats. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or other technical artifacts, showing excellent line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.9)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—luminous, dense, and rhythmically controlled. Every sentence carries weight, advancing character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffold; the line-level craft is propulsive and immaculate from the opening sentence to the resonant final line.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is dense, figurative, and demonstrates exceptional control. Every sentence works to build atmosphere and advance the narrative with a potent rhythm. Lines like "sleepers dreamed of rescue they would later invent as deja vu" achieve a rare combination of precision, poetry, and narrative function. There are no wasted words or scaffold phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and dense with evocative imagery. However, a few moments feel slightly overworked. The repetition of the key phrase "weightless burden" feels like a thematic signpost. More jarring is the line, "his work was over when the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off, not when it begins," an awkward construction that tries too hard to be clever and briefly disrupts the otherwise seamless flow of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and polished to a mirror shine, with very high information density in each line. Figurative language is consistently inventive ("clouds brushed the sills like domesticated thunder"). While the prose is exceptionally strong, one or two images, like civilizations collapsing to a "jeweled dot," approach familiarity, a hairline imperfection in an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—dense, evocative, and precise. Figurative language like "time became visible, swirling like bronze smoke" and minutes like "razor sleet" is both beautiful and functional in establishing the world's physics. The sentences are rhythmically varied and propulsive, with zero evidence of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts. It is a nearly flawless performance at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and almost entirely free of artifacts. Each sentence is laden with information and atmosphere, propelling the narrative forward with a confident, poetic rhythm. While the figurative language is consistently rich, it maintains clarity even at the climax. The sentence "a gong that folded into birdsong" is a prime example of the line-level craft, where image, sound, and action are compressed into a single, powerful phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is rich, imagistic, and propelled by strong verbs and startlingly effective metaphors ("stalactites like fangs of an upside-down leviathan"). However, the piece suffers from a few instances of thematic overwriting that act as minor artifacts. The phrase "hinged awakenings" is used repetitively as a conceptual label, and the climactic line "The hinged awakenings swing wide inside me" is an abstract summary that momentarily flattens the embodied experience of the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and often stunning, with high information density and evocative figurative language. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, propelling the story forward with grace. There is a slight tendency toward a uniform density of ornate phrasing, where nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile. While beautiful, this can feel overwrought in places, and the repetition of a key thematic phrase ("scaffold complexity...") creates a minor loop that slightly dulls its impact on the final read.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates a high level of craft, with varied sentence structure and strong, specific verbs. However, the figurative language is so dense in places ("exhaling light so gentle it seemed to breed new silence") that it occasionally borders on overwriting, slightly impeding momentum. While each image is beautiful, their sheer concentration creates a texture that is almost too rich, a minor artifact in an otherwise stellar performance.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly figurative, a high-risk style that succeeds in creating a memorable atmosphere. Lines like "sand like static across a failed transmission" demonstrate masterful control. While the relentless richness occasionally borders on overwriting (e.g., "word-kayak across the ages"), it remains a consistent and purposeful artistic choice rather than a flaw, with no notable loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with standout imagery like lanterns bobbing "like wilted lilies." However, a few moments dip into slightly clunky, abstract jargon that tells rather than shows (e.g., "thought distilled through working memory," "forging an organelle of collective memory"). These instances, while infrequent, momentarily break the otherwise seamless texture of the prose and prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, with very few wasted words. Word choice is precise and imagery is strong ("rusted tusk," "silver mulch"). There are no significant prose artifacts like loops or template cadences. While a couple of phrases verge on being overly poetic for the moment, the overall effect is one of confident, controlled, and beautiful line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density in its figurative language. However, the sheer density of metaphors ("woven of embered feathers," "hive of muted suns," "spectral ribbons") borders on overwriting in places, occasionally sacrificing momentum for texture. While the style is coherent and serves the story's aims, a slightly more restrained hand could have made key moments land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise for most of the story, with vivid, efficient descriptions ("the horizon bruised purple"). The rhythm and syntax support the building tension well. The score is held back by the final paragraph, which slips into telling ("promising refinements for future seasons") and uses a filter phrase ("Satisfied, she finally allowed..."), slightly softening an otherwise sharp and impactful conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is frequently stunning, with sharp, inventive imagery ("broom gliding like a low comet," "broken stars reflecting like shy eyes"). However, a few moments drift into a more academic or abstract register ("empathic choreography," "sympathetic resonance") that clashes with the grounded, elemental feel. This slight overwriting, along with the thematic summary in the final paragraphs, marginally dulls the otherwise brilliant finish.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious and largely successful, demonstrating high information density and a command of figurative language. The sentences are crafted with a jeweler's precision, creating a rich texture. While the sheer density of metaphor risks becoming overwrought, it remains controlled and purposeful, contributing to the story's unique atmosphere without obscuring clarity in the pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly evocative, with consistently strong verbs and specific, surprising imagery ('torn clock faces,' 'velvet made of absent instants'). While the figurative language is abundant, it feels essential to conveying the strangeness of the world rather than being decorative. The sentences are rhythmically varied, and the piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or other prose artifacts, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density, rhythmic variation, and precise, evocative word choices. The prose is rich with figurative language, but it remains coherent and serves the story's voice and atmosphere without becoming overwrought. There are no discernible loops, redundancies, or other prose artifacts; every sentence contributes to the whole.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is consistently beautiful and demonstrates high information density, with many lines doing multiple jobs. The rhythm and syntax are controlled and varied to great effect. However, the figurative language is so dense that it occasionally verges on being overwritten, slightly slowing momentum in favor of atmosphere. The repetition of "brazen calm," though thematically relevant, reads as a minor tic in an otherwise stellar performance at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and polished to a high sheen, demonstrating exceptional command of rhythm and imagery. While the figurative language is pervasive, it rarely feels overwritten, instead serving to build the story's unique texture and thematic depth. There are no loops, redundancies, or artifacts; every sentence works to propel the narrative forward with both grace and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional craft, with high information density and a powerful, varied rhythm. Figurative language is deployed in nearly every sentence, a risky strategy that succeeds here due to its coherence with the story's mythic tone. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding. The writing is ambitious and pushes to the edge of being overwrought, but its consistency and beauty maintain momentum and clarity throughout, resulting in a distinct and memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates a high level of craft, with strong verbs and varied sentence structures that drive momentum. The figurative language is vivid and inventive. The score is held just below the 9-band because the sheer density of metaphor occasionally risks becoming overwrought, slightly weighing down lines that could be leaner, particularly in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with a varied sentence rhythm that matches the emotional beats of the scene. Figurative language is strong and evocative, particularly descriptions like time feeling like "molten sugar pulled into clear threads." The piece is free of scaffolding or redundancy, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious, with a varied rhythm and many striking images like "a table of frozen lightning." However, the sheer density of figurative language is extremely high, with nearly every sentence containing a metaphor or simile. This relentless richness borders on being overwritten, slightly diluting the impact of individual images and creating a prose that is beautiful but lacks textural contrast. The craft is excellent, but a touch more restraint would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and impeccably controlled, with high information density in every sentence. Figurative language is sophisticated and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without becoming overwrought. The rhythm and syntax vary effectively to match the scene's tension, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft with no discernible artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly figurative, yet it maintains clarity and momentum. While such a high density of metaphor can risk becoming overwriting, here it serves to build the story's unique reality. The syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, accelerating during the climax. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or wasted words; every sentence contributes to the story's potent effect.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lyrical and dense, with a strong, consistent rhythm. Figurative language is mostly excellent ("silence was not empty; it felt braided"). However, a few phrases like "fierce repose" feel slightly self-conscious, and the final paragraph's summary of his transformation ("His exile had ended not by...") reads more like an explanation than a dramatized moment, which slightly dulls the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is dense, muscular, and free of any scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is not ornamental but structural; metaphors like the Marshal’s cloak of “torn pages” or poems as “knives forged of syllables” are deeply integrated with character and concept. Sentence structure varies to control momentum, and the word choice is consistently precise and evocative. There are no line-level artifacts to dull the story’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently strong, evocative, and dense with purpose. Figurative language like "uncertainty gnawed like rust" is sharp and world-specific. However, the sheer density of metaphor and heightened description in some high-pressure beats, such as "Dire enchantment thickened the air, tasting of lightning struck salt," borders on overwriting. While it doesn't obscure clarity, this maximalist tendency is a hairline slip that prevents a higher score in an otherwise impeccable piece.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently elegant and evocative, with a strong, rhythmic cadence. However, a few moments verge on overwriting or rely on slightly familiar phrasing (e.g., "a gesture small yet vast"). The final sentence about the seashell waiting for another promise feels like a sentimental flourish that slightly dilutes the power of Elias's completed personal journey. These are hairline fissures in an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with many striking images. However, it occasionally veers into a high density of aphoristic statements that can feel more like authorial thesis than character thought (e.g., "Intentions vibrate, and the world is mostly listening space"). While the voice is strong, this tendency slightly reduces the narrative's momentum in a few places by stating the theme too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, characterized by high-density, purposeful sentences and a strong, poetic rhythm. Figurative language is inventive and consistently reinforces the story's core concepts ("constellations... rearranged themselves like letters on a grief-struck page"). There is no verbal scaffolding; every line contributes to atmosphere, character, or the accumulative momentum toward the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and image-rich, with high information density and sentence-level propulsion. Lines like "Rain threaded silver needles" are exceptional. There are no significant structural artifacts or loops. The piece is held back from the 9+ band by a few instances of prose that, while beautiful, feel slightly overwrought ("fractured into polite shards") and one key moment of telling over showing ("He realized the eye did not occlude...it filtered...That balance was...").

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is exquisite and demonstrates high information density, though it occasionally nears overwriting. The line "as if the smoke spoke German mountains into his ear" is a rare instance of telling what was already shown, slightly diminishing the power of the inference. This is a hairline slip in an otherwise impeccable and rhythmically controlled piece.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in its imagery ("fissured like an old forehead," "drifting punctuation of light"). The rhythm and syntax support the story’s momentum flawlessly. The final two paragraphs, however, drift slightly into summary ("The lingering promise was kept..."), which tells the emotional resolution rather than letting the final actions carry the full weight, a minor prose artifact that slightly dulls the final beat's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and largely flawless. Line-level craft is superb, with strong verbs and precise, memorable images ("road buckled into shale," "traded horses for silence"). While the figurative language is consistently rich, it borders on being overwrought in a few places, but it never obscures clarity and successfully maintains the story's heightened, mythic tone. There are no loops or wasted words.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is masterful, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and powerful, coherent figurative language. The prose is lush without becoming overwrought, maintaining momentum and clarity even in its most poetic moments. It completely avoids scaffolding, redundancy, or template cadences, presenting as a polished, indivisible whole.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is a highlight, marked by high information density, rhythmic control, and striking figurative language that consistently deepens meaning. Lines like "disbelief offers no calories at altitude" and "jealousy had been the solvent" are both beautiful and functionally critical. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwriting; every sentence propels the narrative forward with clarity and force.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lyrical, precise, and rhythmically controlled. However, a few instances of high-register summary slightly mar the momentum, such as "Every motion mapped emotional terrain inside her chest..." which analyzes the feeling rather than embodying it in a moment of action. The repetition of key thematic phrases, while creating a motif, borders on a conceptual loop that slightly flattens the otherwise superb line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with strong verbs and precise imagery. While the consistent high density of figurative language ("bruised twilight," "newborn stars," "temporary dragons") is a stylistic strength that establishes a mythic tone, it occasionally risks feeling overwrought, slightly favoring texture over propulsion. The piece remains clear and compelling, with no technical flaws like loops or scaffolds.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious and frequently stunning, with images like "accidental sharps of lightning." However, there is a minor but noticeable pattern of paraphrase loops that slightly dulls momentum, particularly in describing the "hush" before the cutting ("unspoken countdown," then "pause thick enough to slice," then "hush thickened"). While the quality is very high, this slight redundancy is the primary flaw preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is ambitious, rhythmic, and often stunning, with high information density in its imagery. However, the sheer volume of figurative language borders on overwriting. The relentless cascade of metaphors ("gray fireflies," "fossilized ribs," "crystal nerve," "distant rain," "universe's hiccup") creates a texture so rich it occasionally risks distracting from the narrative propulsion, a minor but persistent artifact that keeps it just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense with purposeful imagery. The sentence structure is varied, creating a strong narrative momentum despite the contemplative pace. The story is nearly flawless at the line level, but the final paragraphs slightly shift from showing to strategic telling. Sentences summarizing the saboteurs' motives and the historical impact read more like elegant exposition than embodied discovery, creating a minor drag on the otherwise impeccable propulsion toward the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with striking and original imagery. Sentences like "The button was warm, as though someone had just pressed it to call a pet across galaxies" demonstrate exceptional craft. A minor tendency towards abstract summary in a few concluding phrases ("a system built to welcome metamorphosis") is the only element that slightly dilutes the otherwise concrete and visceral prose.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is of a very high caliber, with dense, muscular prose and varied syntax. Figurative language is inventive and thematically consistent, reinforcing character and mood. While the prose is relentlessly stylized and occasionally risks becoming overwrought ("collected its bleed in the notebook"), it remains controlled and purposeful, never obscuring clarity and contributing to the story's unique texture without lapsing into prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic variety. Word choice is consistently precise and evocative ("cracked vowels," "dial tone blooms into silence"). Figurative language is fresh and thematically coherent, such as the harmonica note "tutoring the dark on how to lift its own curtain." There is no scaffolding, redundancy, or overwriting; every sentence propels the narrative with poetic concision.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is executed at an extremely high level, with remarkable information density and rhythmic grace. Figurative language is fresh and powerful ("soot lifting like reversed rain," "grief and joy danced the same narrow quay") without ever feeling cluttered or unmotivated. There are no wasted words, scaffold phrases, or loops; every sentence works to advance character, atmosphere, or action. The piece demonstrates a rare command of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and inventive, with a very high information density. However, its primary strength borders on a minor flaw; the relentless cascade of figurative language, while beautiful, creates a uniform texture that could benefit from occasional, plainspoken contrast to vary the rhythm. While no single metaphor fails, the sheer density slightly mutes the propulsive force in places, keeping it just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and almost uniformly excellent, creating a rich texture that supports the story's mythic tone. While the extreme density of figurative language is a high-risk choice, it succeeds by remaining clear and purposeful. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, propelling the narrative forward in a way that feels both deliberate and incantatory.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and packed with information, demonstrating a strong command of rhythm and figurative language. However, the density of metaphors occasionally feels excessive, verging on overwritten in a few spots, which slightly impedes momentum. Lines like "possibilities inhaled, fluttered, and took tentative root" are poetic but risk distracting from the core action with their complexity, a minor flaw in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is exceptional. The prose is dense with fresh, striking imagery ("notes blooming like nocturnal lilies," "stitching pauses together until they resembled sheet music") yet remains clear and propulsive. The rhythm of the sentences modulates with the action, creating a palpable sense of incantation. There are no wasted words or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to the atmosphere and the accumulative power of the narrative. It’s a piece that demands to be read aloud.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its high figurative density borders on overwriting, particularly in moments of pressure where concision might be more effective ("heart pounding volcanic tenderness," "wept with volcanic tenderness"). The repetition of "volcanic tenderness" feels like a thematic label rather than an organic description. While there are no major grammatical errors, a few sentences could be tightened to increase propulsion and avoid the slight drag caused by the relentless lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. The high density of figurative language is a deliberate stylistic choice that successfully fuels the story's accumulative drive and is sustained without becoming muddled. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the line-level craft is polished, clear, and demonstrates a strong authorial ear for rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control without a single wasted word. Figurative language is dense but always purposeful, building atmosphere without obscuring action ("Metal yielded with the hush of velvet, proving locks can be secrets instead of slots"). There are no loops or scaffolding; every sentence propels the narrative. The line-level craft is polished to a professional, publishable shine.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is frequently stunning and demonstrates high craft. However, its imagistic density occasionally borders on overwriting, with figurative language packed into almost every line, which can slightly dull momentum. There is also a noticeable prose artifact: the clunky repetition of "creating patterns with shutters" within a few lines. While the line-level quality is overwhelmingly high, these moments of slight over-adornment and repetition prevent a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and largely successful, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. While the sheer volume of figurative language borders on overwriting, it consistently serves the story's accumulative, atmospheric goals. There are no loops or technical errors, but a slight dialing-back of similes in a few spots could have increased the power of the most crucial ones. A line like "dreams folded shut like newspapers" shows the prose at its sharpest.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and almost uniformly successful, with stunning figurative language like "a smile sharp enough to cut ropes and gentle enough to sew them into nets." The rhythm and sentence structure are varied and controlled. A minor deduction is for a slight paraphrase loop ("The island was disappearing even while it appeared"), which momentarily restates what was just shown, but this is a hairline flaw in an otherwise impeccable performance.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by inventive, precise figurative language and a strong, varied rhythm. Information density is high, with nearly every sentence contributing to atmosphere, character, or momentum without feeling overwritten. The line-level craft is clean, showing excellent control and avoiding any significant artifacts, loops, or redundancies, even with its high density of metaphor.

    The prose is consistently elegant and information-dense, with a strong, varied rhythm. Figurative language is rich and precise, as in "tarps peeled back like curtains rehearsing revelation." The high density of metaphor is a stylistic choice that works within this lyrical frame without becoming overwriting or obscuring clarity. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or other prose artifacts; every sentence serves a purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is luminous and economical, with high information density in every line. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, as in "stern shoulders dropped like cooling slag," which performs both physical and emotional work. The rhythm of the sentences reflects the story's quiet, deliberate pacing, creating a sense of ritual that elevates the narrative. There are no prose artifacts; every word serves the story's momentum and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, lush, and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in every sentence. Its primary strength—a consistent tapestry of rich, evocative metaphor—is also its only vulnerability; the sheer density of figurative language risks becoming overwriting. However, the metaphors are internally coherent and serve the story's otherworldly tone, and the piece is entirely free of technical artifacts like loops or template cadence, resulting in a powerful, if perilous, performance.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, yet it maintains clarity and propulsion throughout. Every sentence carries weight, advancing character, atmosphere, or plot with impeccable economy. Phrases like "descended through every flavor of despair" and "the latches of thousands of lockets clicked like applause" are both beautiful and functionally precise. The piece passes the read-aloud test with a varied, compelling rhythm and is free of any scaffolding, loops, or overwriting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density and evocative, precise language ("thunder stitched the city streets together"). While the density of figurative language is consistently high, it establishes a coherent and immersive texture rather than feeling overwritten. Every sentence works to advance atmosphere, character, or the central conceit, demonstrating impressive concision and control.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and polished to a high sheen, with high information density in every line. Figurative language is rich and largely coherent, creating a potent, immersive atmosphere. While the style is consistently elevated, it avoids becoming overwrought and successfully supports the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, with a rare combination of density and momentum. Figurative language is rich and inventive without obscuring clarity; in fact, it builds the world's logic. Sentence structure is varied and rhythmic, creating a propulsive, dreamlike cadence. There are no notable prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; every line feels polished and necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is luminous, demonstrating both high information density and rhythmic grace. Figurative language, such as "shards of trust glittering like broken glass," is vivid and purposeful, never ornamental. There are zero technical flaws, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to advance character, atmosphere, or action with remarkable concision. The final line lands with poetic and thematic finality, a testament to the story's superb line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished to a mirror shine, with high information density and potent, original figurative language. The syntax is varied and propulsive, carrying the reader through a lyrical yet clear sequence of events. While the prose is dense with imagery ("smelted comets," "candle wicks"), it rarely feels overwritten; instead, each metaphor serves to build the unique reality of the story. There are no discernible loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; the craft is clean and professional.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with evocative imagery and a varied, musical rhythm. The prose is dense with purpose, and nearly every sentence contributes to the atmosphere or moves the story forward. A minor weakness is the occasional drift into abstract, declarative statements to explain the theme, which, while clear, lack the concrete punch of the surrounding descriptive work and momentarily read like scaffolding for the story's beautiful architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is incredibly dense and figurative, a high-risk style that the author pulls off with confidence. While bordering on overwriting, the rich imagery consistently serves the story's accumulative drive and atmospheric goals rather than obscuring them. The piece is free of technical errors, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating high-level craft where every sentence works to build momentum and texture, propelling the reader toward the resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often stunning, with imagery that carries significant narrative weight ("boots crunching petals of light"). However, a few moments verge on being slightly overworked, where the figurative language becomes more complex than the action it describes. The line describing Silas as a "hinge between what was lost and what might arise," while thematically potent, reads as a moment of authorial summary in an otherwise flawlessly embodied climax.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, precise, and highly imaginative, with figurative language that consistently deepens meaning rather than merely decorating the surface. Sentences are crafted for rhythmic effect and propulsion, moving from the concrete ("brushed iron moss from his coat") to the abstract ("an expanding question mark etched in silver starlight") with seamless control. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, demonstrating a high level of line-level mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and demonstrates high information density. However, its reliance on figurative language is so consistent that it borders on being overwritten. Nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor, and while individually beautiful, their density in peak beats can call attention to the craft rather than immersing the reader in the experience. This stylistic choice is controlled, but a touch more restraint would have amplified the power of key images.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is exquisite, marked by high information density, rhythmic control, and consistently inventive figurative language. Lines like "metal chimed like a single drop of mercury on stone" are stunning. While the density of similes and metaphors is immense, they are so thematically coherent that they build atmosphere rather than cluttering it; however, this sheer density is the only element that holds the prose back from perfection, as it risks overwhelming the narrative motion in a few spots.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful, with inventive figurative language like "a crown fashioned of river stones." The sentences are constructed with care, creating a strong narrative momentum. A minor, recurring weakness is a tendency toward elegant but abstract summary at moments that could benefit from concrete dramatization (e.g., "graceful collapse of deception"), which slightly distances the reader from the action even as it maintains the poetic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is the story’s greatest strength: luminous, dense, and rhythmically impeccable from the opening line. Every sentence carries weight, advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously with no wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language ("Mist hung like lazy gauze," "Night drifted in like oil-free ink") is fresh, evocative, and perfectly integrated into the story's somber, mysterious tone.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, characterized by high information density, varied sentence structure, and powerful, coherent figurative language. The prose propels the narrative forward with a rhythm that mirrors the story's shifts between quiet contemplation and rising tension. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; every sentence serves a clear purpose in advancing story, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, but it occasionally strains under its own figurative density. Phrases like "a tourniquet of meaning" feel overwrought, and one sentence contains a pile-up of mixed metaphors ("directive... promise... entombed... implanted... splinter awaiting skin"). While the overall effect is powerful, these few moments of imprecision slightly mar an otherwise exceptional piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally exquisite, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a few moments of register drift into clinical terminology ("guide visitors through somatic markers," "cue breath and memory") create a slight tonal inconsistency with the surrounding lyrical prose. This minor artifact, while not obscuring clarity, momentarily pulls the reader out of Anisa's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with high information density and evocative imagery. However, the figurative language is so consistently dense that it occasionally verges on being overwrought, slightly dulling the momentum in a few places. A line like "marble columns of shelved dust" feels like one metaphor too many, a minor slip in an otherwise masterfully executed piece.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant, with strong verbs and varied syntax. However, the density of figurative language is extremely high throughout, bordering on overwritten. In several high-pressure moments, nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor, which can slightly dull the propulsion and immediacy, triggering a minor deduction for density per the rubric's overwriting checks.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is superb, with high information density and precise, evocative language. Figurative language is consistently strong and purposeful, such as the decision arriving as a “hairline crack running through her reflection.” The prose is clean, propulsive, and entirely free of scaffolding or redundancy, demonstrating mastery of the craft.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of immediate publishable quality—luminous, precise, and dense with meaning. Figurative language is consistently original and effective, as in "memory quaked through the territory like restless sandstorms." There are no wasted words, no scaffolding, and no rhythmic missteps; the sentences propel the narrative with a grace that matches the story's tranquil but powerful core. The final line is a perfect cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and largely successful, creating a powerful, immersive atmosphere. However, the sheer saturation of figurative language occasionally risks becoming overwrought. The line "Arlen himself possessed a gift: he transliterates emotions..." is a rare moment of telling rather than showing that slightly disrupts the otherwise seamless craft.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is consistently elevated, dense with evocative imagery and precise language ("Storm clouds bruised the horizon," "planets revolving in choreographed orbits of regret"). While bordering on ornate, the figurative language is so well-integrated with the story's core themes that it enhances rather than obstructs momentum. There are no discernible loops or redundancies; every sentence serves a purpose, creating a polished, rhythmic, and highly effective narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density and precise, poetic imagery ("ink had faded to the color of dried tears," "a cathedral after bells"). There are no wasted words, prose artifacts, or overwriting. The language propels the narrative forward while simultaneously building a thick, immersive atmosphere, demonstrating complete mastery of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, lyrical, and precise. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful ("hearts banging against ribs like urgent drums," "scrolls that dragged like tails"). Sentence structure and rhythm are varied to control momentum, creating an "emergent hush" on the page that mirrors the grotto's atmosphere. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every line serves to deepen character, atmosphere, or thematic weight with remarkable economy and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is frequently elegant and evocative, with a strong rhythmic control. However, it suffers from a high density of figurative language and aphoristic statements ("steel begins in fire and ends in heart") that can feel overwrought and occasionally abstract. This constant elevation, while part of the voice, risks blunting the impact of key moments through sheer saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, marked by high information density and inventive, purposeful figurative language that feels integral to the synesthetic POV rather than ornamental. Sentence structure and rhythm are masterfully controlled to build momentum toward the climax. There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; every line serves the whole.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense with fresh, evocative imagery ("foil stippled like moon skin," "a lighthouse watches tides") and demonstrates superb sentence-level propulsion. There are no wasted words or clunky constructions. The high density of figurative language is sustained with remarkable control, creating a rich texture that supports the story's blend of science and art without becoming overwrought or obscuring clarity, even under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished and highly evocative, with high information density in nearly every line. Figurative language, such as "the binary grammar of awakening," is ambitious but remains coherent within the story's conceptual framework. While the style verges on lush, it never becomes overwriting, instead serving to build the specific, quasi-mystical atmosphere the story requires. There are no technical flaws, loops, or redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and striking figurative language that rarely feels overwrought. Sentence structure is varied, propelling the narrative with a quiet, deliberate momentum. While the language is consistently elevated, it avoids obscuring the action. A few phrases border on purple prose but do not break the story's potent, dreamlike atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of exceptional quality: dense, evocative, and rhythmically controlled. Figurative language is strong and consistent, such as "tension stitch itself into her shoulders like sutures." The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or syntactic monotony; every sentence works to advance the narrative or deepen the atmosphere with remarkable efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmic, with figurative language that is almost always precise and evocative. A minor deduction is made for a few phrases ("ambient awareness") that feel slightly more abstract and less grounded than the surrounding text, creating a momentary lapse in the otherwise concrete sensory world.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and highly figurative, with many memorable lines like "the kiln cracked open like sunrise over clay." There are no technical errors, loops, or redundancies. The only slight hesitation comes from the sheer density of metaphors, which occasionally feels overwrought, as in "scalpel wings performing delicate surgery on memory." This high--register consistency is a deliberate choice, but a touch more restraint in key moments could have heightened its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and dense with evocative imagery. However, the story leans on a few key phrases as recurring motifs, most notably “with the rhythm of oars in water,” which is used three times. While effective initially, its final use feels like a deliberate echo rather than an organic thought, creating a minor template-cadence artifact. This repetition, while thematically coherent, slightly diminishes the sense of spontaneous discovery in the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, varied syntax, and fresh, potent imagery. Propulsion is strong throughout the main narrative. A slight deduction is warranted for the final two paragraphs, which shift into a summary tense ("Thus began...") that creates a small but noticeable drop in momentum and immediacy compared to the preceding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a few phrases trend toward being slightly overwritten or abstract ("inevitably whimsical shadow," "signing it with the world itself"). These occasional moments of decorative language are the only elements that slightly detract from an otherwise impeccable line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose contains many striking images and has a confident rhythm. However, it is marred by minor but noticeable artifacts. There is some redundancy ("widening like cracks in ice" followed immediately by a description of the divides) and the final paragraph leans on summary, telling the reader what to think about the events rather than letting the final image land on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense, evocative, and propulsive. Figurative language is not ornamental but fundamental to the story's world-building, as in "mournful arches that seemed to bend space." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or action with remarkable precision and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and polished, with strong, rhythmic sentences that establish the story's hushed, misty tone from the opening line. Word choice is precise and imagery is vivid ("mist twirling like pale serpents," "dye spiraled outward"). While the high density of figurative language occasionally risks becoming overwrought, it generally serves the atmosphere without obscuring clarity. The line-level craft shows a high degree of control and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is exceptional: dense, evocative, and propelled by a strong, varied rhythm. Figurative language is consistently inventive and purposeful, never ornamental ("barometer sounded like a hinge," "a cautionary smile that looked moth-eaten"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence carries weight and advances the narrative or atmosphere. The clarity and power of the language, especially during the chaotic climax, is masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious and largely beautiful, with striking images and a compelling rhythm. However, there are moments where the figurative language becomes overly dense, slightly impeding momentum with phrases like "negotiated pixelated amnesty between matter and maybe." This tendency toward overwriting is a minor flaw in an otherwise pristine line-level execution, keeping it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is consistently superb, with high information density and evocative figurative language that rarely falters. A couple of sentences drift toward summary or abstraction (e.g., "...dissuade the past through territorial markers and reclaimed silence"), slightly flattening the immediacy. However, these are minor blemishes in an otherwise flawless and propulsive prose performance that is free of loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional clarity, density, and elegance, with a sentence-level propulsion that carries the reader effortlessly. Figurative language ("cosmic braille," "sunset trapped in fiber") is not ornamental but integral to the story's conceptual framework. The piece is remarkably clean of scaffolding or redundancy, relying on strong verbs and precise imagery to do its work.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and powerful, with high information density in most lines. However, there is a slight tendency toward an over-saturation of figurative language in peak moments. A line like "Words became petals, drifting into the mirror, thawing its surface like spring sunlight on a battlefield’s frost" combines three distinct metaphors, slightly muddling the otherwise sharp imagery. This minor overwriting is the only blemish on an otherwise stellar piece of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense with imagery yet remains clear and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative, with strong verbs and specific nouns carrying the narrative weight. The piece is remarkably free of scaffolding or redundancy; each sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or action. While highly figurative, the language avoids becoming overwrought, instead building a cohesive and immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and demonstrates high information density, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a slight artifact moderately dulls its otherwise flawless surface: the phrase "inlaying meaning everywhere" is repeated in a way that feels more self-conscious than resonant. This lyrical echo, while thematically linked, calls attention to the authorial hand in a story that otherwise feels seamlessly immersive, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery that does significant work. Sentences are well-constructed for rhythmic effect, such as the short, impactful "Purpose flickered, fragile but lit." The craft is consistently high, with no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or overwriting; every line propels the narrative or deepens the mood with impressive economy.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with nearly every sentence performing multiple functions. Word choice is precise and evocative ("ion dust," "linguistic voltage"), and the rhythm of the prose modulates effectively with the story's tension. While the density of figurative language is consistently high, it remains coherent and serves the story's specific, high-concept reality. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the craft is clean and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, demonstrating high information density and sentence-level propulsion without a single wasted word. The figurative language is dense but purposeful, serving as the primary engine of clarity and meaning in this lyrical piece. The prose is free of loops, scaffolding, or cliché, with a varied and musical rhythm that reads beautifully aloud. The final lines, in particular, are a masterclass in concise, evocative writing.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with high information density and strong verbs. At moments, the figurative language becomes so dense that it slightly impedes momentum, such as in the line "the hush inside vibrated like held breath during the heartbeat of a hesitation." However, there are no significant structural artifacts like loops or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, dense with figurative language that is largely successful and evocative. The line-level craft demonstrates high control over rhythm and imagery, propelling the narrative forward. The primary flaw is the final sentence of the narrator's journal entry, which functions as a piece of thematic scaffolding that should have been removed in favor of the more powerful closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery. However, there are minor but noticeable instances of stock phrasing ("heart trembling," "fingers trembled") and a key line at the climax ("Understanding flooded her") that feels more like a summary than an embodied experience. The repetition of "cautious exuberance" is a small but distracting echo in a piece this short.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful. However, there are moments where the figurative language becomes slightly overwrought, threatening to draw attention to its own cleverness. Lines like "fate itself had been aerated for easier breathing" and the "fiscal perforation" metaphor, while inventive, border on distracting and slightly dilute the emotional impact of an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and exceptionally crafted, with virtually no wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistently fresh and purposeful, such as the aurora as "lungs of a sleeping god" or the Admiral's voice as "a ship cresting fog." While the style is elevated, it never feels overwritten because every image serves to heighten the specific atmosphere and advance the textural accumulation. The piece demonstrates high information density and rhythmic variety without a single line that breaks its spell.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and demonstrates a high level of craft, with strong verbs and evocative figurative language ("silence that pooled like ink"). There is a high information density without sacrificing clarity or momentum. A minor reservation is a tendency toward very rich, almost overwrought, similes during peak moments ("tender as first grape skin split for wine"), which slightly thickens the texture where leaner prose might have hit harder. This is a stylistic choice, but it holds the line-level execution just short of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and precisely chosen metaphors that are both beautiful and functional ("sea air drapes around me like explanation," "lighthouse feels less like a guidepost and more like a lung"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffold phrases; every sentence works to build atmosphere and advance the protagonist's internal state. The craft is seamless and supports the story's allegorical weight without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, demonstrating high information density and sentence-level propulsion. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, such as lines slipping from Mira's face "like old paint from rainwashed timber." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or the advancement of the lesson. The clarity and elegance of the line-level craft are flawless, even when describing metaphysical events.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is lyrical, precise, and dense with striking, functional imagery. Sentence structure and rhythm vary effectively to match the narrative's pace. The only minor flaw is a single instance of redundancy in a key sentence: "...reading distance, depth, and direction through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight," which slightly dulls an otherwise sharp and elegant line.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, characterized by its precision, information density, and evocative figurative language ("gears ticking like insects trapped in amber algorithms"). There is no wasted language; every sentence serves to advance character, atmosphere, or action. The piece is free of loops, scaffolding, or other artifacts, demonstrating a high degree of line-level mastery and polish.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently polished and evocative, with high information density and striking, original imagery. The rhythm is controlled and sentences are well-crafted. The sheer density of figurative language, while beautiful, occasionally borders on overwriting, and the single sentence of abstract realization stands out in an otherwise concrete narrative, representing a minor friction.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by a strong rhythmic control. Word choice is precise and evocative ("terminus," "errant," "unsynced"), building the world and atmosphere at the line level. While highly figurative, the language avoids overwriting by ensuring every image serves the story's central logic and tone, particularly in the high-pressure climax.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, poetic, and meticulously controlled. While rich with figurative language, it avoids becoming overwrought, as each image serves the story's atmosphere and progression. The syntax and rhythm are varied, creating a propulsive yet melancholic cadence. There are no wasted words or line-level artifacts; the craft is polished to a mirror shine.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, dense with evocative imagery, and propelled by a varied and controlled rhythm. The language is precise and purposeful, with very few wasted words. A minor deduction is warranted for a high density of figurative language that, in a few moments ("brittle devotion vibrates strangely"), can feel more writerly than character-bound, slightly abstracting the peak emotional beats rather than grounding them further.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in nearly every line. Figurative language is rich and purposeful, though it occasionally verges on being overly dense. However, it consistently serves the story’s atmospheric goals without obscuring clarity. The framing device of the wind chime falling silent is used effectively to bookend the core narrative arc, demonstrating excellent structural control at the sentence and paragraph level.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.5)
    Line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, rhythmic control, and precise, evocative language. Figurative language, such as "cold fire streamed into her palms like river-light turned solid," is consistently inventive and coherent with the story's world. The piece is free of scaffolding or redundancy, demonstrating a masterful command of concision and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is overwhelmingly strong, with high information density and evocative imagery. However, a couple of minor artifacts prevent a 9+ score. The repetition of the phrase "attentively inventive" feels slightly redundant and lessens its impact. Similarly, the sentence "Trust had been forged in that rush of air, and trust was what she still meant to preserve under pressure" creates a minor paraphrase loop that could have been more concise.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, lyrical, and demonstrates a high level of craft, with vivid, original imagery ("memories muffled like distant drums beneath glacier ice"). Sentences are propulsive and information-dense. While the figurative language is consistently elevated, it skirts the edge of being overwritten in a few places, a minor issue given the story's abstract, surrealist nature. There are no technical flaws, loops, or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propelled by strong, specific verbs. Figurative language is consistently inventive and effective, such as silence "pressed flat by thunder" and a phrase settling "like pollen." There are no wasted words or scaffold phrases. The only minor hesitation is an occasional turn of phrase that feels slightly too self-aware or ornate, like the distant thunder being "applause from clouds," but this is a hairline critique in an otherwise immaculate performance.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is incredibly ambitious, dense with figurative language, yet maintains momentum and clarity. Every sentence is load-bearing, contributing to character, atmosphere, and action simultaneously. This high-risk stylistic choice pays off handsomely, creating a unique texture that is inseparable from the story's power and avoiding the pitfalls of overwriting through sheer control and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with a rare lyrical quality. However, a few phrases lean toward the abstract or overly conceptual, such as "practiced interiorizing exteriors," which reads more like a stated thesis than an embodied action. While the density is largely a strength, this occasional preference for the conceptual label over the sensory detail is the only element holding the line-level craft back from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and demonstrates a high degree of line-level control with excellent information density. There is a slight tendency toward over-writing, with figurative language that is occasionally relentless. The denouement shifts slightly into a more summary-like cadence, which slightly lessens the propulsive energy established in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and evocative, original imagery ("the air smelled like struck quartz"). The prose is rhythmic and controlled, accelerating for the glider flight and slowing for the delicate work of tuning. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought passages; every sentence serves to build atmosphere, character, or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmic, with memorable and precise figurative language. Nearly every line works to build atmosphere and advance the story's unique sensibility. The only slight flaw is the sheer density of metaphor and simile; the relentless poeticism occasionally risks becoming overwritten, and a few more simple, declarative sentences might have provided effective contrast and allowed the strongest images to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and imagistically dense, with many standout lines ("blueprints rolled tight as prayer scrolls," "shadows intersected like anxious clock hands"). Momentum is excellent, driven by strong verbs and varied sentence structures. The primary weakness is a tendency towards overwriting; nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor, and while they are often individually effective, their density can feel slightly overwrought in places, bordering on a stylistic tic. This high density slightly impedes propulsion in a few spots but does not obscure clarity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates high information density, with many lines doing double duty for world-building and theme. The figurative language is inventive, such as "translating water logic into stellar grammar." While the style is a significant strength, its uniform density occasionally verges on overwriting, slightly slowing momentum in the middle section before the powerful acceleration of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, but it is marred by a significant flaw early on. The line, "The aid... could detect murmurs others missed, by tracking faint pulses in a decades-old hearing aid," is a clear and distracting paraphrase loop, restating the same information in adjacent clauses. While the rest of the piece is very strong, this unforced error in a critical setup paragraph prevents a higher score for an otherwise polished work.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is immaculate. It is both lyrical and surgically precise, with exceptional information density in every line. Figurative language is fresh and powerfully effective ("crashing hush," "damp auroras"), enhancing the atmosphere without ever feeling overwritten. There are no wasted words, no scaffolding, and no rhythmic monotony; the sentences build with a propulsive, elegant cadence toward a perfectly pitched final line.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with high information density and rhythmic control ("electricity crawled across the dark liquid like silver spiders"). However, a few phrases ("vanished like a dream at waking," "wolves beneath the bed") rely on slightly familiar constructions that momentarily soften the otherwise unique texture. While the overall execution is very strong, these minor instances prevent it from achieving flawless line-level originality.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and exceptionally clean, with high information content in every line. Figurative language is constant but purposeful, building the story's textural world rather than merely decorating it. The piece avoids all common prose artifacts like loops or scaffolding, and the sentence structure varies to control momentum, particularly in the climactic sequence which remains both lyrical and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently strong, clear, and propelled by vivid imagery and varied syntax. Information density is high. However, the sheer density of figurative language occasionally borders on being overwritten, with a few phrases feeling more ornate than necessary for the moment. While there are no technical flaws like loops or scaffolds, this tendency toward maximalism slightly tempers the otherwise brilliant line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high informational density, rhythmic variety, and precise, evocative word choice. Figurative language is rich but controlled, consistently serving to sharpen images and deepen atmosphere rather than obscure meaning. The prose is immaculate, with no discernible scaffolding, loops, or redundancies, resulting in a piece that feels both polished and propelled by an inherent musicality.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of the highest caliber, demonstrating exceptional information density and rhythmic control. Word choice is consistently evocative and precise, creating a rich texture without a single overwrought sentence. There are no loops or redundancies; every line propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere, culminating in a final paragraph where the language itself seems to lighten as the story’s central tension resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and demonstrates high information density, with many lines serving multiple functions. The figurative language is often stunning, such as the song pouring through Marlo "like varnish warming under sun." The score is tempered slightly by the unrelenting density of this lyricism, which at times verges on overwriting, and one minor narrative intrusion ("unaware it is...") that briefly steps outside the established POV.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly evocative, with sentences that consistently perform multiple functions. Figurative language, such as "a door of pure sentence structure unfolded like origami verbs," is inventive and supports the story's core concept. While exceptionally rich, the prose avoids becoming overwrought, maintaining momentum and clarity through its precise, rhythmic construction, culminating in a clean and resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and rhythmic, achieving a remarkable level of poetic intensity. While the figurative language is pervasive, it remains coherent and purposeful, rarely slipping into pure ornament. A few moments approach the edge of being overwritten, but the overall control is so strong that it succeeds in creating a hypnotic, immersive texture without sacrificing clarity at pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is consistently elegant and imagistic, with high information density in most lines. While the figurative language is overwhelmingly successful, a few moments flirt with being overwritten or rely on less original imagery (e.g., "converged like question marks"). The sheer density of metaphor occasionally feels self-conscious, slightly impeding momentum rather than accelerating it. However, the piece is free of technical errors, loops, or scaffolding, and its best lines are truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous, dense with specific imagery and controlled rhythm. Sentences are crafted for propulsion and clarity, doing multiple jobs at once. A few minor phrases ("Thus her motivation was simple," "Frustration lapped at her ribs") dip into more conventional constructions, preventing a perfect score, but these are hairline flaws in an otherwise impeccable line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates high information density. However, the sheer volume of figurative language, while beautiful, slightly over-saturates the high-pressure climax, momentarily distracting from the action. While each metaphor is strong, their density in the final confrontation creates a slight textural drag that a final polish would address.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, but it suffers from an overwriting artifact: nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor. This relentless density of figurative language ("whispered silk," "unopened letter," "moonlit persimmon") can feel decorative and occasionally slows momentum, particularly during the central action. While the craft is high, a more varied sentence structure with moments of plainer language would have allowed the key images to resonate more powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, yet it maintains exceptional clarity and propulsion. Each image serves a narrative function, from the "glass moons" setting the scene to the "silver bubble of seaside wind" advancing the ritual. While consistently elevated, the language avoids becoming overwrought; there are no mixed metaphors or scaffold phrases. The syntax is varied and confident, resulting in a piece where every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, and plot without a single wasted word.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is the story's greatest strength: dense, evocative, and surgically precise. Word choices like "wounded chart," "aureate coastline," and a panel that "exhaled cold air" demonstrate a high level of craft. There are zero instances of scaffolding, redundancy, or rhythmic monotony; every sentence works to advance the plot and deepen the atmosphere with remarkable efficiency and elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with figurative language that consistently deepens character and atmosphere ("a collapsed writing desk...like a gasping mouth"). While the high density of lyricism borders on overwriting in a few moments, it never breaks the voice or obscures clarity. There are no wasted words; every sentence propels the internal journey forward with a steady, quiet momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and no wasted words. Figurative language is not decorative but foundational to the story's logic, as in "waveforms made visible by flashing stormlight." The prose is musical and rhythmic without falling into repetitive patterns, demonstrating a masterful command of sentence structure and pacing. There are no loops or scaffolding; every line propels the rich, atmospheric narrative forward.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with fresh, evocative imagery that rarely falters. Sentences are rhythmically varied and propel the narrative with a quiet, confident momentum. A minor blemish appears in the line “oddly inquisitive, even warmly inquisitive,” which is a slight paraphrase loop, a hairline crack in an otherwise flawless surface that prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and rhythmic, demonstrating high-level craft. However, the final clause—"proving conclusively that even empty spaces remember who trusted them"—functions as a thematic echo. It explicitly states the theme that the preceding images had already powerfully proven, slightly flattening the earned resonance of the ending by moving from showing to telling.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is rich and imagistic, with high information density in nearly every line. While the figurative language is exceptionally dense ("stillness settled like pollen," "dome crouched...like a tired moon"), it rarely obscures clarity, instead building a cohesive, immersive world. The writing is meticulously clean, with varied sentence structures and strong verbs, showing a high level of craft and avoiding any significant prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant and dense with imagery, demonstrating high line-level craft. Sentences are rhythmically varied and purposeful, propelling the quiet narrative forward with a sense of wonder. While the language is consistently elevated ("stranded luminance," "familiar meridians"), it avoids becoming overwrought and successfully establishes the story's speculative, romantic tone. There are no notable loops or scaffolding; every sentence contributes.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with striking and original figurative language ("horizons pink as old receipts"). While the high density of imagery skirts the edge of being overwritten in places, it remains coherent and purposeful within the story's lyrical mode, avoiding confusion. The sentence structure is varied, propulsion is strong, and there are no discernible loops or scaffolding, resulting in a polished and immersive read.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("shedding stones like weeping bark," "a lullaby learning to walk"). The rhythm and sentence structure are varied and controlled. At times, the density of figurative language approaches being overwritten, particularly in the opening, but it generally serves the story’s fantastical atmosphere without obscuring clarity. The line-level craft is free of significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with high information density and powerful imagery. While the repetition of key phrases ("bruised awe," "nested patterns") works as a successful lyrical refrain, the final paragraph contains a significant tonal flaw. The line "Somewhere an apocalypse yawned, found its timing misplaced, and settled back to dream a little longer" is too whimsical, breaking the profound "bruised awe" established so carefully throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery ("clings to the cliff like a bruise," "gears tick like impatient hearts"). There are no technical flaws, loops, or scaffold. The only minor weakness is a slight self-consciousness in the repetition of key phrases like "graceless beauty," which, while purposeful, feels slightly less organic than the rest of the prose and calls attention to the authorial craft.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong rhythm and precise word choice. However, it verges on overwriting; nearly every sentence is laden with figurative language, which slightly dulls the momentum and can feel like a stylistic tic rather than a responsive choice. This high density of metaphor, while beautiful, creates a uniform texture that mutes the dynamic shifts in the scene's emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, with dense, purposeful figurative language and a varied, musical rhythm. Nearly every sentence works on multiple levels, advancing plot, building atmosphere, and deepening theme. A slight demerit for the final two paragraphs, which lean toward thematic summary ("Thus the place...", "Some journeys..."), briefly pulling away from the potent imagery that defined the rest of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is of the highest caliber, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and vivid, original figurative language. Each sentence works to advance character, atmosphere, or plot, with zero evidence of scaffolding or redundancy. The prose is both beautiful and propulsive, demonstrating a rare fusion of poetic sensibility and narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful, but occasionally tips into being overwrought. Figurative language is sometimes stacked too heavily (e.g., "sunrise hidden under feathers"), and the repetition of the trait-label "empathetically decisive" feels slightly artificial. These minor artifacts prevent a perfect score but do not derail the story's powerful momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious, with high information density and a varied, poetic rhythm. However, its relentless reliance on figurative language occasionally verges on being overwritten, particularly in moments of high pressure. A sentence like "a single organism divided by courage and echo" is beautiful but conceptually crowded, and this density slightly impedes momentum in a few key places, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, yet it maintains exceptional clarity and momentum. Word choice is precise and evocative, creating a rich texture without becoming overwrought. The piece avoids paraphrase loops or template cadence, varying sentence structure to control rhythm effectively. The intentional repetition of “clandestinely luminous” functions as a strong motif, linking the tool to the prize and demonstrating superb line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates a high level of craft, with varied rhythms and high information density. The figurative language is lush and inventive, though it verges on being overwritten in a few spots. Phrases like "symphonically minded skull" are slightly cumbersome, and this minor lack of polish in an otherwise pristine piece is what holds it back from the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional, demonstrating high information density, syntactic variety, and rhythmic control. Figurative language is both beautiful and purposeful, as in "sealing light away like a bishop behind pawns." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every line serves to advance character, atmosphere, or action with remarkable concision and elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose contains many stunning lines, but it suffers from a high density of figurative language that at times feels overwrought. Phrases like "persuading rust to crumble like pastry" and a sigh "softer than candle smoke," while lovely in isolation, create a cumulative effect of richness that can slow momentum. This stylistic choice, bordering on a prose artifact, slightly compromises the clarity and propulsion of key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and demonstrates high information density, with figurative language that consistently reinforces character and theme. The rhythm is controlled and sentences are well-crafted. The only minor weakness is in the final paragraph, where the metaphorical density increases to the point of feeling slightly less grounded and more like an authorial summary than the precise, embodied prose preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lyrical and imagistically dense, with striking lines like "pebbles lifted around his boots like praying beetles." The line-level craft is very strong, with no scaffolding or redundancy. However, the sheer density of figurative language is relentless, occasionally feeling overwrought and prioritizing texture over forward momentum, a stylistic choice that keeps it just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is the story's greatest strength: dense, evocative, and surgically precise. Every sentence carries weight, advancing plot, atmosphere, and character simultaneously. Figurative language, like "cranes hanging like arrested pendulums" and walls folding with "origami precision," is fresh and perfectly suited to the clinical, strange tone, demonstrating impeccable line-level craft with zero artifacting.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, varied syntax, and powerful, concrete imagery. The prose achieves a rare balance of being ornate yet clear and propulsive. A minor deduction is warranted for the final sentence, which slightly stalls the momentum by summarizing a theme that the preceding action had already perfectly embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and largely flawless, with striking and original figurative language ("like felt drawn across a drum," "air rattled thin as tin foil"). The rhythm and syntax are varied and propulsive. A minor repetition of the phrase "avalanchingly quiet" is the only hairline imperfection in an otherwise stellar execution; it reads as a deliberate motif, but slightly reduces the element of surprise on its second appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, varied syntax, and an exceptional ear for rhythm. While the prose is dense with figurative language, it rarely feels overwritten, instead building a consistent and immersive magical reality. Each sentence propels the narrative forward, culminating in a final paragraph where every word feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with striking imagery like 'sunrise thawing icicles' and 'wind carved flutes into obsidian.' While the quality is exceptionally high, a few sentences lean slightly into summary ("Thus Tren extended brief encounters...") or direct statement, which lightly tempers the otherwise masterful demonstration of 'show, don't tell.' These are minor imperfections in a piece that otherwise exhibits superb syntactic variety and rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional control of rhythm and syntax, with high information density in every line. While the figurative language is consistently elevated and risks overwriting, it remains coherent and serves the story's mystical tone without obscuring meaning. The piece avoids cliché and scaffolding, showing a high degree of line-level craft, though a slightly lighter touch in one or two spots could have pushed it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is luminous and dense with purpose, achieving a rare fusion of poetic language and narrative momentum. Word choice is precise, and the rhythm of the sentences mirrors the soft, deliberate beats of the loom. Figurative language isn't decorative; it's the very logic of the world. While the final sentence verges on stating its theme, the preceding images are so powerful it reads as a gentle coda rather than a clumsy summary. The line-level craft is exceptional throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and rhythmic, with powerful figurative language that rarely falters. While the high density of metaphors is sustained effectively, a few phrases like "the interval where knowledge falters before resolve ignites" feel slightly more abstract than the surrounding concrete imagery. This is a hairline imperfection in what is otherwise exceptionally polished and propulsive line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery that drive the story forward. Figurative language, like the "helix of perfume," is fresh and purposeful. There are no significant prose artifacts, though a few sentences lean slightly more on declaration than dramatization ("His trade was rare," "His motive was simple"). Overall, the line-level craft is superb and propels the narrative with rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density and striking, original figurative language ("flame buttered the walls," "confusion draped like kelp"). Sentences are crafted with a poet's ear for rhythm and concision. While the density of imagery is consistently high, it rarely feels overwritten, instead contributing to the story’s immersive, magical atmosphere. The piece is free of loops, scaffolding, or other line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, inventive, and highly polished, with very few wasted words. The figurative language is stunning ("jester who had swallowed thunder," "laughter...tucked behind his teeth like caged lightning") and consistently supports the otherworldly atmosphere. While the density verges on overwhelming in a few places, it never collapses into incoherence and maintains a powerful rhythmic momentum through to the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control on every line. Figurative language is fresh and precise, never muddled ("warning and invitation braided in azure fire"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere. The line "drawn by a hush louder than drums" is a testament to the author's mastery of craft. Zero prose artifacts were detected.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and exceptionally clean, with not a single wasted word or motion. Figurative language is inventive and consistently serves to clarify and deepen the story's reality ("sorrow crystals," "caged thunderclap," "floor opened like a gently sighing book"). The piece demonstrates masterful sentence-level propulsion and syntactic variety, showing zero loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    While the prose is often beautiful, its relentless figurative density becomes an artifact, with similes or metaphors in nearly every paragraph, occasionally dulling momentum. There are also minor paraphrase loops, such as "'The tone in my chest felt like bound release, a simultaneous holding and letting go," where the second half explains the first. These patterns, while not severe, prevent the prose from achieving the highest level of concision and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and varied sentence structures. However, the density of figurative language is exceptionally high, with metaphors and similes appearing in nearly every paragraph. While individually effective, this saturation borders on overwriting and slightly undermines the story's core tone of "enlarged tranquility" by feeling effortful rather than effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is of a very high caliber, characterized by dense, evocative prose and a confident rhythm. Figurative language is strong and precise, such as "vines stitching lattices" and "golden steam." The story avoids major artifacts, but a few sentences drift into an overly analytical or abstract register ("Every action sketches a hypothesis"), slightly pulling away from the embodied experience. This minor register drift is the only element holding it back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous and dense with information, showcasing exceptional line-level craft. Figurative language is consistently fresh and purposeful, such as gears that "chirp like distant sparrows frozen midflight." While the line "Guilt thundered" is a slight dip into convention compared to the surrounding originality, it's a minor point in an otherwise impeccably polished piece with zero scaffolding or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with virtually no wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language is fresh and effective, consistently reinforcing atmosphere and character. The sentence-level craft is excellent, creating a seamless read without loops or rhythmic monotony, allowing the story's potent imagery to land with maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and figurative, a high-risk approach that pays off completely due to its internal consistency and precision. Every sentence is load-bearing, advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the result is a piece with immense propulsive power and poetic grace.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and striking images like "numbers peeled like petals." However, it occasionally tips towards being overwrought, with figurative language that feels slightly strained ("bottled like thunder...yet lidless"). The deliberate repetition of "auroral sorrow" works as a motif but risks feeling heavy-handed, slightly diminishing the otherwise excellent line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and rich sensory details ("crumbled into dust," "clicked like a held breath released"). The rhythm is controlled and sentences are well-crafted. The score is held back by the final paragraph, which shifts from potent imagery to declarative summary ("She understood that..."), a moment of scaffolding that slightly dulls the otherwise pristine execution of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is the story's defining feature: dense, lyrical, and consistently inventive. While verging on overwriting, the figurative language is almost always coherent, fresh, and purposeful, building the story's unique atmosphere ("cold stitched his throat," "gravity remembered it"). There are no technical flaws, loops, or scaffold. Every sentence works to advance the story's mood and meaning, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. The risk of such a high-density style pays off handsomely.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and efficient, with high information density and evocative imagery ("serpent respecting my measured geometry"). There are no significant artifacts or loops. A few phrases, like the repeated "thereby" in the protocol description, are slightly mechanical, but this is a minor blemish in an otherwise polished and propulsive piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is often luminous and demonstrates a strong command of rhythm and imagery. However, it occasionally tips into overwriting with a high density of figurative language ("doves released from a child's sketch," "heartbeat discovering light"). These moments, while pretty, can feel slightly self-conscious and momentarily pull focus from the grounded emotional core of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and flawlessly executed. Figurative language is consistently strong and purposeful, as in "a fallen titan's eyelid" or "bubbles that glittered like applause." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence drives the narrative forward while enriching the atmosphere. The rhythm and syntax vary effectively to match the rising tension of the escape.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and confident, marked by strong verbs and striking, original imagery. Sentences are crafted for rhythmic effect and propulsion, with very little scaffolding or redundancy. The line-level execution is consistently high, though a phrase like "startled yet comforted" feels slightly more generic than the surrounding prose. This is a minor slip in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, with incredible information density and poetic precision in every sentence. Figurative language, such as "sanding every edge of noise" and "the music of shut doors," is both original and functionally clear. The prose is immaculate, with varied syntax and a powerful rhythm that drives the accumulative momentum toward a flawless, resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, with a rare density of potent and original figurative language ("sparks stitched silver syllables," "teacups like punctuation marks"). Momentum is maintained beautifully, and the sentences are varied and propulsive. While the sheer richness of the prose borders on overwhelming, it remains controlled and purposeful, serving the story's specific tone without obscuring clarity, even during the high-pressure climax. There are no loops or scaffolding; every line works.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with striking images like “petals drank indigo dusk” and “constellations uprooted from sky.” However, there is a persistent density of figurative language that occasionally borders on overwriting, and a reliance on abstract emotional descriptors like "ghostly resolve" and "tragically radiant." The primary flaw is the scaffolding-like thematic summary in the final paragraphs, which lacks the concision and propulsion of the story's best lines.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, elegant, and controlled, demonstrating high information density and a strong, rhythmic cadence. While the figurative language is often exceptional, its sheer density occasionally verges on overwriting, with some phrases feeling more decorative than propulsive ("opaline sorrow"). This is a hairline imperfection in an otherwise masterful performance, a final polish away from flawlessness, but it slightly tempers the propulsion in a few key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and polished, demonstrating masterful control of rhythm and figurative language. While verging on ornate, the style is a purposeful choice that creates the story’s fable-like atmosphere and never obscures clarity. Sentences are constructed for maximum impact, conveying information, character, and tone simultaneously with impressive economy and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is superb, with high information density and clear sentence-level propulsion. The prose is rich with figurative language that, for the most part, deepens the atmosphere without becoming overwrought. A few phrases like "windows of connection" feel slightly more like authorial labels than organic parts of the world, a minor artifact in an otherwise flawless execution. There are no loops or significant redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is of the highest caliber, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and stunningly precise figurative language ("firefly season embroidered the courtyard air"). The prose achieves a rare poetic quality without sacrificing clarity or momentum, containing zero scaffolding, loops, or overwriting artifacts. Every sentence works to advance character, atmosphere, and idea in a seamless, elegant whole.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density and evocative, precise language ("shimmered like a hallucination," "radient as hope"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or plot momentum. The syntax is varied and the rhythm controlled, creating a polished and propulsive reading experience from the first line to the last.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious and almost entirely successful, marked by high information density and striking figurative language. The rhythm and syntax support the epic tone without faltering. While the sheer density of metaphors borders on overwriting in a few moments, it never breaks clarity or momentum, and crucially, the language at the climax remains powerful and precise ("split the thundercloud like a seedpod").

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is consistently elevated and evocative, with high information density and a clear, compelling rhythm. Figurative language is strong and purposeful, such as the hum "brushing cobwebs like a careful broom." The piece avoids scaffolding or redundancy, moving with a momentum that feels both deliberate and effortless. While one or two similes verge on the ornate ("puddled like moonlit tide pools"), they remain within the bounds of the story's lyrical, fable-like register and do not detract from the clarity of the peak emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density. However, the sheer density of figurative language throughout constitutes a form of overwriting; striking images are so frequent that they diminish each other's impact. The prose is strong but lacks the strategic restraint that would elevate it to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is exquisite and highly controlled, marked by vivid imagery and a compelling rhythm ("ice thick as glass spun for giants," "the hum was the revolution beginning to breathe"). Its momentum is only slightly diminished by a minor tic: occasionally following a potent, concrete image with a more abstract, explanatory phrase (e.g., "...unyoking me from urgency more surely than shackles unfasten wrists"). This hairline flaw slightly tempers the otherwise brilliant line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally crisp and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. However, some abstract phrasing ("fortified vulnerability," "mausoleum of intentions") feels slightly overwrought and less grounded than the surrounding concrete details. The final line, "droughts end, but vigilance must flow," is a memorable aphorism but contributes to the thematic summary noted in Q5, slightly dulling the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is exquisite, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistently inventive and purposeful, such as hope misting "like incense escaping an unlatched thurible." While the density of simile and metaphor borders on overwhelming at times, it remains coherent and serves the story's heightened, almost fable-like tone. There are no wasted sentences, loops, or scaffolding; every line contributes to the "vibrant hush" and the story's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is consistently inventive and imagistic, demonstrating high-level craft. However, the density of figurative language is so high that it occasionally borders on overwriting, with nearly every sentence carrying a simile or metaphor, slightly dulling the impact of the most crucial images. Furthermore, the final line functions as thematic scaffolding, a prose artifact that states the story's meaning rather than letting the final image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is clean, dense, and propulsive, with strong verbs and evocative imagery that avoids overwriting. Sentences are syntactically varied, creating a rhythm that adapts to the scene's pacing. There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or scaffold phrases; every line serves to advance character, plot, or atmosphere with precision and elegance, particularly in the climactic sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally elegant and precise, with strong imagery and varied sentence rhythms. Lines like "Spray from the polar sea hissed against gnarled apple trunks" are evocative and efficient. However, there are moments where the density of figurative language approaches overwriting ("doubts curled like smoke inside conviction," "facets dark yet whispering of futures diverted"), slightly hindering momentum without adding significant new information.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, dense, and highly lyrical, with powerful and precise imagery ("the marina groaned like a tired leviathan shifting armor"). The rhythm and syntax vary effectively to match the emotional pacing. A few metaphors, such as the foreman's nod being "older than the mountains" or the horizon's "lantern," are slightly self-consciously literary, momentarily thinning the otherwise immersive texture, but the overall craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with precise, evocative imagery. The command of figurative language is consistently high, with images like "breath clouds like spilt milk" demonstrating mastery. A single phrase, "nurture intersubjective understanding," creates a minor register shift into academic language that feels slightly out of place with the otherwise earthy, poetic lexicon, representing a rare hairline crack in a nearly flawless surface.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, rhythmic precision, and evocative, original figurative language. Sentences like "The wind over the Crescent Expanse carried a hush that felt like philosophy spoken in sand" establish the tone immediately. The prose is entirely free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, demonstrating a masterful control that propels the quiet narrative forward with grace.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and largely free of mechanical flaws. However, the density of figurative language is extremely high, with similes and metaphors appearing in nearly every paragraph ("startled moths," "secret staff," "shadowed petals," "eager metronome," "silver thread," "confetti blessings," "warm tea"). While consistently toned, this relentless ornamentation borders on overwriting and slightly dilutes the power of the most crucial images by surrounding them with so many others.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is exquisite, marked by high information density, rhythmic control, and inventive figurative language. Sentences are crafted with precision, propelling the narrative forward while deepening the atmosphere. The score is capped below 9.0 only because the final two sentences, while elegant, shift from demonstration to direct explanation, slightly flattening the poetic ambiguity so carefully built before that point.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and highly figurative, a style that succeeds due to its precision and consistency. Lines like "a curse that let tomorrow flash open like a match, then drop into water" are both beautiful and functionally clear within the story's logic. While dense figuration can be a risk, here it builds the necessary textural and emotional reality of the piece without lapsing into overwriting or obscuring momentum. The craft is clean, purposeful, and executed at a very high level.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and evocative, precise language. The prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and a strong rhythmic sensibility that supports the story's contemplative pace. While the language is consistently rich, it avoids becoming overwrought, as each figurative element serves the established tone without creating mixed metaphors or obscuring clarity, even in the peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is polished and often beautiful, but it carries a density of figurative language that occasionally verges on being overwrought. Phrases like "anchored ship in milk" or "tears made small mirrors on his cheeks," while evocative, can draw attention to the writing itself. This slight tendency toward ornate prose is the only factor holding it back from the highest marks.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, dense, and demonstrates a high level of craft with varied sentence structures and strong word choices. There are no technical flaws like loops or scaffolding. The line-level execution is held back slightly by a stylistic tendency toward overwriting, where nearly every sentence carries a complex metaphor, occasionally feeling self-conscious rather than seamlessly integrated into the character's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently elegant and information-dense, with striking and original figurative language ("a low chime resonated, like a rib cage remembering its first breath"). Its momentum is excellent and the clarity is pristine even amidst complex ideas. The score is held just shy of the 9.0+ band by a few minor instances of thematic summary in place of pure dramatization, such as articulating Kedron's yearning directly, a small blemish on an otherwise masterful line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is exquisite, marked by high information density, strong verbs, and varied syntax. Every sentence serves the story's tone and momentum. The prose is saturated with figurative language ("Mist coiled like sleepy dragons," "pearl of stillness"), a high-risk style that succeeds due to its coherence. The sheer density, while effective, verges on being overwrought, which is the only element holding it back from a near-perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is of a very high literary quality, characterized by its precision, rhythm, and startlingly effective imagery ("gauze over a bruise," "electrolyte and loam"). Sentences are dense with meaning without feeling overwritten. There are one or two phrases that lean slightly towards direct statement ("Action steadied his trembling hands more effectively than sympathy"), but these are minor slips in an otherwise impeccable performance. The language propels the story's quiet momentum beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and dense with imagery, but it exhibits a minor template-cadence artifact. The sequence of introducing and dismissing the three cameos follows a repetitive structural pattern ("First came... The girl dissolved," "Second... The fisherman faded," "Third appeared... Before vanishing"). This slightly mechanical rhythm is a small seam in an otherwise luminous and carefully crafted piece, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is luminous and evocative, with high information density in its figurative language. However, this strength borders on a flaw; the density of metaphors and similes is relentless, risking overwriting and lacking textural variety. Nearly every sentence contains a figurative flourish ("quiet applause," "ribbons of dawn light," "comet tails"), which slightly flattens the rhythm and can feel more decorative than purposeful in moments, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density and a powerful, poetic rhythm. Nearly every sentence serves multiple functions. A few instances lean slightly explanatory, such as "The map, however, was still scattered data; it needed a seal," which momentarily tells rather than shows the stakes of the next step. This is a hairline imperfection in an otherwise luminous and flawlessly crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. At times, particularly during the climax, the density of figurative language becomes almost overwhelming, verging on overwriting ("a chorus bright enough to see," "walls themselves applauded"). This high density, while ambitious, occasionally pulls focus from the action itself rather than clarifying it.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high informational density, evocative figurative language, and a strong, varied rhythm. Sentences like "The bronze grotto under starlight glimmered like a hollowed bell, its ribs ringing with a whalebone reverie" establish voice, setting, and mood with remarkable economy. The prose is ornate yet purposeful, avoiding the pitfalls of overwriting by ensuring each image serves the accumulative drive of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense, precise, and evocative. Figurative language is consistently fresh and purposeful ("dissolved like chalk in rain," "rust-hued peace settled over her shoulders like a performer’s cape"). There are no wasted sentences, loops, or scaffolding; every line propels the story's emotional and textural momentum. The syntax is varied and controlled, creating a rhythm that is both elegant and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional craft, with high information density and a strong, poetic rhythm. Figurative language, such as regret being "a currency accepted by ghosts" or a memory being "unshelved," is inventive and tonally consistent. Sentences are structured with purpose, accelerating during the storm and settling into the "fractured stillness" of the pier. The piece is polished, with no discernible loops, scaffolding, or artifacts to dilute its momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is polished and professional, with clean syntax, strong verbs, and evocative figurative language that consistently serves the story's "stoic wonder" tone. The prose is efficient and free of distracting artifacts, demonstrating a high degree of control and artistry.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with a strong, varied rhythm. However, the density of figurative language is extremely high; nearly every paragraph contains multiple similes or metaphors. While individually effective, their sheer volume verges on overwriting, slightly congesting the otherwise clean lines and drawing attention to the craft itself.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is exceptional, marked by high information density, precise word choice, and evocative, original imagery ("Mist lay in bands over the water, cool and luminous as breath made visible."). Sentences are propulsive and rhythmically varied, and there are no instances of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting. The final line—"direction seemed an open conspiracy"—is a perfect, tonally resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exquisite, marked by high information density, strong verbs, and original, evocative figurative language ("gulls stitched pale circles," "hollow roots of frozen thunder"). There are no wasted words or scaffolding. The piece demonstrates masterful control of rhythm and syntax, creating momentum through precise and beautiful lines that serve the story at every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of the highest caliber, marked by rhythmic control, syntactic variety, and powerful, original figurative language. While the density of metaphor is high, it is established early as the story's native register and never obscures clarity or momentum. There are no technical flaws, loops, or scaffold; every line is polished and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but occasionally veers into overwriting where the density of figurative language slightly obscures the action. A few transitional sentences summarize instead of dramatize (e.g., "Through the discovery of this tension, Oriven conceived the next step"), acting as scaffolding that momentarily flattens the otherwise immersive prose.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense with striking and original figurative language ("grains run through her fingers like lunar time," "melody was crushed glass and sunrise"). There are no technical flaws, loops, or overwriting; the density is purposeful and serves the story's accumulative method. The sentences propel the narrative with a controlled, poetic rhythm that is both beautiful and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is meticulously crafted, with high information density and a clear, propulsive rhythm. While the figurative language is consistently inventive, its sheer density is relentless, occasionally bordering on overwriting where a moment of simpler prose might have provided powerful contrast. However, the metaphors are coherent and serve the mythic tone without obscuring clarity at pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is luminous and demonstrates high craft, with inventive, powerful metaphors. However, the figurative density is relentless, bordering on overwritten in a few passages where nearly every sentence contains a complex metaphor. For instance, the opening paragraphs, while beautiful, are so saturated with imagery that they slightly impede momentum. A slight thinning of this density would elevate the piece to near-perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density and precise, evocative language. Sentences like "They thought he meant poetry; he meant stone" do immense work in a short space. Figurative language, such as teenagers releasing "ash like accidental prayers," is fresh and thematically coherent. The prose maintains momentum and clarity throughout, with a varied rhythm that supports the story's meditative yet purposeful pace. There are no wasted words or text artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is a significant strength, marked by high information density, striking figurative language, and a powerful, varied rhythm. Sentences like "Salted wind knifed along the tidal obsidian ridge" establish tone and setting with muscular economy. While the language is consistently elevated, it remains purposeful and avoids overwriting, propelling the narrative with confidence and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with high information density in most lines. There is strong syntactic variety and momentum. A minor weakness appears in a few instances of overwriting where abstraction replaces concrete imagery, such as the sentence, "...reminding him that comfort can chafe when steeped in unresolved memory," which verges on thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is exceptional, characterized by high information density, striking imagery ("sandpaper over glass," "lazy jungles of thought"), and a controlled, lyrical rhythm. Every sentence works to advance the story, atmosphere, or character. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought figurative language; the density of the prose serves the story's intellectual and aesthetic ambitions without obscuring clarity, especially in the crucial final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and precise, evocative language. The prose is rich with figurative language, but it serves the story's voice and atmosphere rather than feeling ornamental. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence propels the narrative forward while simultaneously building the world and deepening the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is exquisite and demonstrates a high level of craft, with strong verbs and evocative, original imagery. However, the density of figurative language is so high that it occasionally borders on feeling overwritten, slightly impeding momentum rather than accelerating it. A line like "the crystal keeps melting in his hands" leans toward thematic summary in a piece that otherwise relies on powerful indirection. These are minor flaws in a superlative execution.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and precise, with very few wasted words. The opening paragraph is a masterclass in establishing world, character, and tone. Figurative language, such as "sanding down certainties" and "roofs became reefs," is consistently fresh and purposeful. There are no notable loops or scaffolding; the sentences propel the narrative forward with clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and frequently stunning, with high information density and rhythmic control. Lines like "The pause grew round and resonant, like the hollow of a long-absent instrument" demonstrate masterful craft. A minor deduction is for a slight tendency to explain its own effects, as in "The sound did not persuade by argument; it clarified...", which momentarily shifts from showing to telling. This is a small friction in an otherwise polished and beautiful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and dense with vivid, purposeful imagery. However, a few key phrases like "synaptic plasticity" and "micronutrients" introduce a clinical register that feels slightly at odds with the story's otherwise mythic, lyrical tone. This tendency toward scientific explanation in a few spots constitutes a minor form of overwriting that slightly dulls the magic of the moment, preventing a higher score for an otherwise beautifully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is a standout strength, marked by high information density, evocative imagery, and a controlled rhythm. Word choices are precise and memorable ("bottled lightning, crackling like a captured yell"). The piece is free of line-level artifacts, loops, or overwriting, demonstrating masterful craft from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with striking and original figurative language. However, the story is marked by a significant line-level flaw: "Loneliness can carve deeper than knives, she thought, inadvertently profound and startled by her own words." This combines a cliché with meta-commentary that momentarily breaks the narrative voice and pulls the reader out of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, precise word choice, and evocative imagery. Sentences like "Its lilac surface kept leaking lavender smoke that sketched question marks before dissolving" are both beautiful and functional. The prose avoids overwriting; its richness serves to build the world and Aios's internal state. There are no notable loops, redundancies, or syntactic patterns that dull momentum, resulting in a polished and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of a very high literary quality, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is inventive and generally serves the story's surreal atmosphere well (e.g., "clouds moved under us like discarded thoughts"). While the density of metaphor is consistently high, it is so well-integrated into the story's conceptual framework that it rarely feels overwritten, maintaining propulsion and clarity even in its most lyrical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, striking figurative language, and a clear, propulsive rhythm. Word choice is precise and evocative without ever feeling overwritten. The prose is clean, free of scaffolding or repetitive artifacts, and every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or momentum. The final line provides a perfect, quiet cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense with striking, original imagery ("glass-voiced," "reliquary key," "ripple like dough beneath a baker's knuckles"). The rhythm is controlled, and the language is precise. The piece avoids major flaws, but a few phrases, like the final thematic summary and the repetition of "rosewater dread," slightly reduce the propulsion of the final beats by shifting from concrete imagery to abstraction or verbatim repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious and often brilliant, with powerful, concise imagery ("gears smaller than barnacle teeth," "motes that drifted upward like reversed snow"). However, in a few places, the density of figurative language verges on being overwrought, slightly impeding momentum. Phrases like "the smothered shimmer of latent radiance leaking from the stones" feel less focused and impactful than the story's strongest lines, representing a hairline flaw in an otherwise masterful performance.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often brilliant, with striking images like "vomiting watery letters." However, its very density occasionally verges on overwriting, with a high frequency of figurative language that can slightly impede momentum in high-pressure moments. While the effect is largely successful and stylistically coherent, a demanding editor would flag a few phrases for concision to ensure propulsion is never sacrificed for texture.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density. However, its relentless figurative richness occasionally verges on overwriting, where the density of metaphor slightly impedes the narrative momentum, particularly during the storm sequence. While the style is consistent with the voice, a more varied cadence would have made the peak moments even more impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, poetic, and immaculately controlled. Figurative language is consistently inventive and purposeful, avoiding cliché while enhancing clarity ("a hush clings to the tiles like damp linen"). While the style verges on maximalist, it never sacrifices momentum or clarity, particularly in the climax where complex actions are rendered with precision. The rhythm and syntax are varied and sophisticated, demonstrating a masterful command of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("flashlight slicing through dust like a censor's pen"). The momentum is excellent, and there are no technical errors. The score is held back slightly by a tendency towards high-register abstractions and constructed aphorisms that, while fitting the tone, occasionally feel overwrought and slow the otherwise crisp pacing of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, yet remains clear and propulsive. Word choice is consistently precise and evocative ("a hushed blaze," "interlaced absence," "trapped applause"). The story avoids scaffolding or redundancy; every sentence works to build atmosphere or advance the character's internal journey. While the style is elevated, it never feels overwrought, successfully sustaining its poetic register without sacrificing clarity or momentum, even in moments of physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lyrical and dense with strong imagery, particularly in its opening and middle sections. Sentences are well-constructed and propel the narrative forward with a distinct rhythm. The final paragraph, however, becomes slightly overwritten, with figurative language ("inked upon a broken world," "dawn... prepared to open its fragile pages") that feels more abstract and less grounded than the tactile prose that precedes it, slightly dulling the sharpness of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is ambitious and exquisitely crafted, with high information density and arresting figurative language. The execution walks a fine line, as the sheer density of metaphor ("koi swam through the air like censers leaking color") risks becoming overwrought, but here it succeeds, building the story's unique textural atmosphere. Line-level propulsion remains strong, and there are no technical flaws or wasted words, resulting in a polished, impactful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious and highly polished, marked by strong verbs and high information density. The rhythmic control is excellent, particularly in moments of tension. The only minor weakness is a tendency towards high figurative density that occasionally feels self-conscious, and the repeated phrase "intangibly tangible," while thematic, verges on becoming a tic by its third use.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong, with high information density and evocative figurative language ("dragging someone's unborn memory into daylight"). There is a slight tendency toward overwriting, where nearly every sentence carries a metaphor, which risks blunting the impact in moments of high action. However, the prose is propulsive, clear, and free of technical errors.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative ("valcouer," "kelp twine"), and the syntax varies to control rhythm masterfully. The sentence-level craft is superb, with very few wasted words. The deliberate repetition in "a hush sifted, sieved hush" is a stylistic risk that pays off, intensifying the atmosphere rather than creating a loop, demonstrating a high level of authorial control.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is of the highest caliber. The prose is dense, lyrical, and precise, with no overwriting or wasted words. Figurative language is consistently fresh and effective, from "gusts ploughed trenches in the air" to a brow "knitting like wet rope tightening." The rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful, creating a momentum that is both stately and tense, culminating in a final paragraph of exceptional resonance and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lyrical, dense, and rhythmically controlled, with figurative language that is both vivid and purposeful ("Clouds bunched like bruises overhead"). The piece demonstrates high information density and sentence-level propulsion. A minor deduction is warranted for the final paragraphs, which verge on summarizing the thematic takeaway, slightly flattening the prose at the crucial moment of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates a very high level of craft, with memorable images like "lace forged from engine grease." Momentum is excellent, and the syntax is varied and propulsive. The only minor artifact is the threefold repetition of the phrase "delicately robust," which, while thematically deliberate, slightly overplays its hand and draws attention to its own construction in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and dense with striking imagery ("aroma sharp as comet tails," "sliced it like bread"). However, the final two sentences slightly deflate the landing. The line "For after the phoenix rises..." is a powerful thematic statement, but the concluding "We were those someones now..." feels like an unnecessary summary that explains the new status quo, rather than letting the resonant action of opening the censer close the story.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is exquisite, with high information density and a powerful, rhythmic cadence. However, its very richness creates a slight friction; the density of figurative language is relentless, occasionally feeling overwrought. The repetition of key words like "bruised" and "choking," while thematically coherent, borders on becoming a tic, pulling the score down from the highest tier for an editor wary of over-stylization in a high-pressure scene.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, dense with figurative language that, for the most part, lands with precision and power. While teetering on the edge of being overwritten in the climax ("bones whispering like flutes carved from dandelion stems"), it maintains coherence and serves the transcendent nature of the moment. The piece is free of technical errors, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating high-level craft and control.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and varied syntax. However, it occasionally suffers from a high density of figurative language that borders on overwriting, where the imagery becomes more ornate than clarifying (e.g., "parchment soaked in thunder then dried in moonlight"). While the rhythm is excellent and there are no technical errors, this relentless ornateness in a few key spots slightly dulls the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, strong verbs, and resonant figurative language ("doors yawning like polite giants"). The prose is lush and walks a fine line of being overwritten, but maintains clarity and momentum, particularly in the climax. It avoids loops and scaffolding, with each sentence contributing to the story's forward motion and atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, yet it maintains clarity and momentum. Word choices like "sinuous cadence" and "liquid geometry" are both beautiful and precise. There is a risk of being overwritten, but here the elevated style feels integral to the story's mythological scope. The piece avoids scaffolding and repetition, with each sentence contributing to the potent, dreamlike atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional craft, with high information density and a powerful, varied rhythm. While the figurative language is extremely dense—risking overwriting—it remains coherent and voice-motivated, serving the story's lyrical mode. Lines like "static haloed each cumulus, making the heavens look like a wounded photograph mid-development" are stunningly precise, showcasing a command that justifies the heightened style without impeding propulsion or clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density in each line. However, it suffers from a relentless barrage of figurative language, particularly in the opening, which verges on overwriting and can slow momentum. While many images are striking, their sheer density occasionally muddles the action rather than clarifying it, a key flaw in an otherwise masterful performance.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its relentless density of figurative language constitutes a form of overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile, which can exhaust the reader and, paradoxically, flatten the prose's rhythm by maintaining a constant high pitch. While individual images are strong, their sheer volume detracts from momentum and clarity in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong rhythm and sentence variety. However, the density of figurative language occasionally verges on overwriting, slightly dulling the impact through saturation. The repetition of the “fate”/“destiny” concept in the final paragraphs feels a touch redundant, a minor scaffolding artifact in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is polished to a mirror shine, characterized by high information density, rhythmic grace, and precise, evocative language. Figurative language is consistently strong and purposeful, as in the "embryo fruit shaped like an ear," which is both a striking image and a key plot point. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, demonstrating a professional level of line-by-line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently beautiful and imagistic, with high information density in most lines. However, a few minor repetitions slightly mar the otherwise flawless surface. The phrase "rhythmically placid" appears twice, and a sentence like "Every instruction arrived through instructions..." contains a small redundancy. While these are minor, and the repetition of "placid" might be a deliberate motif, they momentarily break the hypnotic spell in a story that relies heavily on incantatory rhythm.
