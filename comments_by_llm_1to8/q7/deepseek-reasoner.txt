  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm, particularly in "The flood was a full stop, but in its aftermath, the sentence was continuing." Some redundancy appears ("gradual change" concept restated) and occasional overwriting ("impossible density," "seismic shifts") but momentum sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and some striking images ("her breath pluming in the air, a ghost of her former luminosity"). However, several instances of overwriting appear ("The drifting resonance of the place, the haunting quiet") and some redundancy in describing the quiet/silence motif.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery like "flowers that glittered like captured constellations." However, several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("unshaken marvels," "perpetual, frozen bloom") and the phrase "silently expressive" appears twice verbatim. Some redundancy in explaining Elara's method across paragraphs 3-4.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose occasionally strains with phrases like "pursuit of chased stillness" and "soul of light," creating mild register drift. Some sentences could be tightened—"He had to revitalize the lens, to make it speak its coded light once more" contains redundancy. However, the rhythm effectively modulates between the methodical restoration work and the climactic descent.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Strong moments like "a whispered rumor that grew into a sustaining myth." Deductions for occasional overwriting ("breathtaking views"), some abstract phrasing ("collective despair"), and redundancy in describing the community's suffering. The "amplified quiet" construction appears twice, creating mild repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with moments of overwriting ("forgotten promises," "pilgrim of sparks journeying through lives"). Some abstract phrasing in emotional beats ("profound and aching motivation") rather than embodied sensation. The final transformation sequence maintains clarity despite figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"luminous, geometric dust" and "the texture of memory, simultaneously solid and ephemeral." However, abstract phrases like "geometric certainty" and "sensory overload" occasionally tell rather than embody. The "quaking reverie" feels forced, and some sentences could be tightened for momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong momentum and varied sentence structures. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deduction for repetitive phrasing around "patiently strategic" and "plant resilience in dry soil" appearing three times, and some filter-verb clustering ("She could hear," "she beheld").

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and sensory precision, particularly in passages like "The glass domes are shattered, and the twisted branches...frozen in a silent, perpetual scream." Some figurative density in emotional peaks ("shattering prism of obsidian and ice") and occasional abstract phrasing ("acoustic vulnerability") create minor friction.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though phrases like "quietly savvy grace" and "profound solitude" edge toward tell-language. The final paragraph's density serves the closure effectively, but mid-story passages contain some filter-verb accumulation ("she realized," "she would leave").

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong craft-specific vocabulary and varied sentence structure, but several abstract formulations weaken precision: "weighty lightness," "profound and paradoxical peace," "occupied by a future." The "violent, cracking, painful thawing heart" edges toward overwriting. Some filter constructions ("she realized," "she felt") could strengthen through direct perception.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong momentum. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive "He [verb]" constructions in paragraph 4-5 and some abstraction ("transformative betrayal," "obliteration of his very self") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs (describing while advancing the mapping process). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("temporal geometry defined by the single witness") but serves the mythic register. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose maintains clarity through complex temporal shifts with varied sentence structures and strong information density. Minor redundancies appear ("moments prior" / "And then again" repetition), and some filter constructions could be tightened ("It saw," "It had witnessed").

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("muted glow of ornate streetlamps"). Minor redundancy in explaining the hornet nickname's significance. The phrase "ambiguously clear" borders on oxymoronic cleverness that slightly muddies meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "hands were a map of thorn-scars." Some overwriting in the climax ("exploded into a constellation," "transcendent, impossible beauty"). Template cadence appears briefly ("She had mended... She had let them believe"). Information density is high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied rhythm and strong sensory detail ("mechanically warm energy, filling the room with an icy warmth"). Minor redundancy appears in "quiet, absolute certainty that settled into her bones" but overall maintains good momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. However, "profound peace" and "sacred, drowned space" edge toward elevated register in the closure beat. Minor template cadence in "She stopped...She opened...She had to" sequence. The "unstruck chords" motif bookends effectively without forcing symbolic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("hollowed out and clear"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("baptism of ice," "achingly pure") and minor redundancy around "weight" and "truth." The final paragraph achieves excellent rhythm despite these minor frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("grimy glass beads," "scream of tearing metal"), but some overwriting appears in descriptive passages ("paradoxical blend of bone-deep fatigue and hyper-vigilant focus"). Minor scaffold in explaining Leo's method rather than showing it in action initially.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression, though figurative density in places approaches overwriting ("stone wept dust and knowledge dissolved into mud"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor template cadence appears in "He journeyed deeper...He moved through it."

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythmic variation, especially during the eclipse sequence. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "profound weight"/"lead weight" for the locket, multiple versions of Leo's blankness. Some overwriting in emotional moments ("cautious exuberance, terrified of breaking the spell but exhilarated") and unnecessary scaffolding phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong moments like "walls have heard, the whispers trapped in stone." Some abstract phrasing ("terrible new weight," "fortress for its final, waking thoughts") and slight repetition of "bronze quiet" create minor drag. Information density is good overall.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm shifts, but several abstract phrases weaken immediacy: "familiar enigma," "grand scheme," "terrifying clarity." The metaphor mixing of musical terms (transpose, orchestrate, symphony) with light/navigation occasionally strains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some abstract passages ("potential," "multiplicity") lack concrete grounding. Minor density issues in philosophical sections ("His assumption had been that oneness was purity") but no major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with vivid specificity ("pearlescent segment," "logarithmic spiral"). Some overwriting in the climax ("celestial orchestra," "crescendos of color and diminuendos of shadow") borders on purple. Minor template cadence in "She was... She wasn't..." construction. Information density high in the dawn sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("stalactites of crystallized anxiety"). Several abstract constructions weaken immediacy: "darkening brightness that promised revelation and dread," "obsession burned into her soul." Template phrasing appears in "She saw not one... but a dozen" construction.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("a music recorded forever backward in her bones"). Some overwriting in the forest passage with elevated diction ("cathedral of gold and crimson"). Template structure in the drum sequence ("The deep, thrumming bass was...The quick, light tap was...") creates minor cadence monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally clean with purposeful variation, though some template phrasing appears ("She looked from...to," "She would not...she would"). Information density is good in investigation sequences. Minor loops in emotional description ("rattled nerves," "trepidation," "curiosity") and some filter verb clustering ("she noticed," "she thought," "she saw") reduce immediacy without serving voice.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong sensory specificity and information density, with lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in peak beats ("cathedral of crystal shadows") and occasional redundancy ("hot and silent") create minor friction. No major loops or scaffolding. Rhythm varies appropriately with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("singular, burning need," "fracture in reality"). The filter verb "he felt" appears multiple times in pressure beats. Strong control in the closing paragraph redeems somewhat.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some elevated diction appears ("mendicant's bowl," "chronic hush"). Minor template cadence in "She played..." repetition, but it builds textural accumulation purposefully. Information density adequate but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong musicality ("whispered against the glass," "honey-colored light filtering") though occasionally tends toward ornate ("architecture of convincing half truths"). Some filter constructions ("She felt," "She saw him then") could be more immediate, but information density remains high with most sentences advancing multiple story functions.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some phrases edge toward the ornamental ("resonant note...hang in the air," "cautious exuberance"). Information density is solid with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in the middle section's chronological progression.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery, though some phrases edge toward overwriting ("beautiful, painful yearning," "boldly sympathetic" used twice). Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template patterns in "She knew...She raised...She would not" sequence but momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "She worked with quiet desperation, for her subject was time itself." Some elevated diction ("entropy's grasp," "geological epoch") occasionally drifts from character register but doesn't obscure meaning. The final image of drawing "with a steady hand, her time now her own" provides clean resolution through action.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("The mathematics hadn't failed. It had been answering the wrong question") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("mineral-rich water," "resonant soil") and repetitive structures. Some passages edge toward purple prose without clear purpose, particularly in descriptive sections.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. Minor redundancy in describing Silas's invisible helper role, but overall momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of lyric precision ("the sky tore open," "petrichor") but suffers from repetitive sentence openings ("She saw," "She had," "She worked") and occasional overwriting ("circuitously sincere," "reluctant metamorphosis"). The paraphrase loop around studying behaviors (paragraphs 1 and 5) and some abstract phrasing ("sustaining transformation") create mild drag, though the closing image lands with appropriate resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong information density—most sentences advance multiple layers. Good syntactic variety and momentum through the vision sequence. Some elevated diction ("desiccation," "thresh") occasionally strains against the intimate register but serves thematic weight. No significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery like "silhouette a stark cutout" and "tiny moon resting in her hand." Minor redundancies appear ("tiny, magnificent moments"/"infinitely precious seconds") and some abstract phrasing ("steady unpredictability") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful variation, though some paraphrase loops appear ("navigated absences" concept restated multiple times). Filter-verb stack in paragraph 6 ("She sat back," "She looked," "She felt") dulls immediacy during the crucial revelation beat. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance story or atmosphere, but some scaffolding remains ("The method was always the same"). Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts from methodical opening to accelerated discovery. Some redundancy appears ("trembling certainty" used twice, "unspoken truths" repeated without variation). The final paragraph's "ready to document the truths she would find" tells what could be implied, slightly weakening the close.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("profound isolation," "raw, courageous kindness") and mild redundancy ("lonely songs"/"loneliness"). The phrase "entangled memories" appears twice without evolution. Strong momentum in the transcription sequence where syntax accelerates appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.6)
    While individual sentences achieve poetic effect ("hushed thunder, a promise of violence held in abeyance"), the prose suffers from density issues with abstract concepts stacked without breathing room. The philosophical weight occasionally obscures momentum, particularly in the vortex sequence where metaphysical description dominates over concrete experience.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("breached every trust but his love for her"). Some overwriting in metaphorical passages ("The contradictions swirled like the ink") and slight template cadence in paragraph 3 ("She saw...She saw"). Information density good but could be tighter in middle exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose flows with varied syntax and strong sensory precision, especially in "The air was cool and carried the scent of damp earth and miniature blossoms." Some redundancy appears in the vision catalog ("a gardener...a couple...yesterday's rain") that could compress. The final paragraph contains mild scaffold with "another captured texture, another sliver of truth" that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm shifts. However, several instances of elevated diction ("grim pronouncement," "meticulous and patient") and abstract phrasing ("texture of memories") dull immediacy. The metaphor "cold stone in K's chest" is stock, and some passages lean toward telling over showing, particularly in the investigation summary paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves moments of strong compression ("The myth was true, but not in the way anyone had said") and varied syntax, but suffers from abstract descriptors ("gloomy cheerfulness," "melancholic peace"), occasional redundancy ("universal riddle" appears twice), and elevated register that occasionally drifts from the established voice. The filter verb "She understood then" and similar constructions dull immediacy in the vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several template phrases appear ("weight...like an anchor," "sound like creaking wood"). Information density is high in action sequences. Minor paraphrase loop with "hopeful desperation" appearing twice. The final paragraph maintains propulsion despite length.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and selective detail, though occasional overwriting appears ("pure, stark lunacy"). Information density is high—most sentences advance plot while building atmosphere. Some template phrasing in transitions ("She knew," "She understood," "She thought") creates minor friction but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with good momentum through the diagnostic sequence. Information density is solid with most sentences advancing plot or atmosphere. Some overwriting in metaphorical descriptions ("iron belly of the city") and occasional redundancy in explaining the drone's function.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong rhythm variation and effective image density, particularly in "gaunt silhouette," "frost-ferned map," and "obsidian ice." Minor redundancy in explaining the ice-fisher's word after showing it ("It meant 'the before-place'") and some abstract phrasing ("worrying tranquility") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong rhythmic control, particularly in "Tap. Step. Tap-tap. Step." Information density is high throughout with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition in "infinitely patient" appears twice but serves thematic emphasis. No significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose shows strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, though "lonesome splendor" repetition and occasional elevated diction ("preternaturally still," "ephemeral") create minor register drift. Information density remains high throughout, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density works well in descriptive passages. Several instances of elevated diction that border on overwriting ("granite silence," "deep and waiting void"). Some repetitive phrasing around light descriptions reduces score.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density with lines doing multiple jobs ("ashen-veil ghost bride, drifted between the gnarled, silver-barked trees"). Some register elevation in phrases like "profound grief" and "soaring joy" creates distance in peak emotional beats. Minor template cadence in "She had... She had kept" structure, though generally clean with good momentum through varied sentence lengths.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful imagery, though some figurative density crowds peak moments ("orchid solace," "luminous steps"). The sewing sequence achieves strong propulsion through concrete action. Minor issues include occasional abstract scaffolding ("Her motivation was singular") and slight overwriting in emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong momentum, though occasional overwriting appears ("quietly desperate heart," "cautious enchantment made whole"). Information density is high—most sentences advance discovery or deepen atmosphere—but some metaphorical flourishes could tighten ("vibrated in her bones").

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the clipboard description establishes tool, texture, and emotional weight). Some figurative density in the opening paragraph ("ghost-whispers," "phantom clatter") without clear payoff. The "archaeologist of intention" metaphor in the final beat introduces new vehicle without prior grounding, creating mild register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong moments like "her needle a tiny conductor in the echoed silence" and the phosphorescence reveal. Information density is generally high. Minor deductions for repetitive "she began" constructions and some filter verb stacking in the discovery sequence that slightly impedes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts between description and action. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in places ("fragile, weightless second") but pattern is consistent with voice. Clean grammar and punctuation throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("twilight bled the last of the color") but several overwrought phrases ("lotus-hearted ache," "graft new meaning onto old wounds") feel forced. Some template phrasing in emotional beats. Information density is good but occasional purple patches ("labyrinthine surface a silent echo of neural pathways") slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery like "fog diffused the weak afternoon sun into a soft, omnidirectional glow." Some overwriting in passages like "disconnected from tangible time" and occasional abstract phrasing ("the electric thrill of creation"). The installation sequence achieves strong momentum through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity and varied sentence structure. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("liquid jewel," "sonic alchemy") and slight template cadence in the vision sequence ("She saw... They saw... In a final act..."). The "nested within the first" construction feels slightly forced, though line-level momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several passages contain abstract phrasing that slows momentum ("vibrant garden of unregistered ideas," "beautiful, converging chaos of pressure"). Template cadence appears in the final paragraph with repeated "of" constructions. The prose achieves strong moments (the cricket dispersal signal) but inconsistent density, with some sentences doing single jobs where compression would heighten effect.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery and varied rhythm. Information density is high, particularly in descriptive passages. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("quiet, persistent madness," "shyly unstoppable compulsion") and some redundancy between "centuries of longing" appearing twice in different forms.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery and varied rhythm, but some overwriting appears ("profound foxglove regret, tall and tinged with poisonous purple") and redundant phrasing ("silent, shimmering vault"). The metaphorical density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum through the decipherment sequence. However, several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("reverent dread," "cautious exuberance," "tangled knot of syntax") and the metaphorical density in places ("chain of intent and meaning," "conducting" the text) occasionally obscures rather than clarifies. The "hum...not a sound but a feeling" construction works but pushes the boundary.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts during crisis moments. Some figurative density in non-peak beats ("dappled resolve fractured, patches of fierce determination clouded by waves") and one instance of slight redundancy ("deep, harmonious hum resonated") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("a digital scream into the void"), but occasional overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("painful and blooming withering process"). Some template phrasing emerges in transition moments, though the closing image lands with clarity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong moments ("butterfly's wings," "dusty eyes staring") but suffers from occasional overwriting in the prism terrace section. Some redundancy appears in emotional descriptors ("sacred, charged with terrifying energy"). The closing paragraph maintains good momentum despite density, though "quiet miracle" edges toward telling rather than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, especially in "Together, in a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer." However, several issues: the unexplained Chinese character, some overwriting ("negative image of the night sky"), and repetitive "rhythm" usage in the final section. Template cadence in "She belonged to..." sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong imagery density with "fractured light into a thousand watery hues" and "glyphs of deep blue and somber grey," though some abstract phrasing ("profound, resolute acceptance," "magnificent, terrifying force") could be more embodied. The rhythm varies effectively between longer descriptive passages and shorter revelatory moments.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, though some overwriting appears ("calculated wilderness of the music," "maestro of maybe"). Information density high in chess-move descriptions that simultaneously advance plot and atmosphere. Minor template cadence in "She was no longer...she was his" construction but doesn't pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The law had taken her past; she would not let it take her future"). Some overwriting in figurative density ("obsidian grace" appears twice, "sharp and beautiful severance") and abstract phrasing ("profound and private grief," "portable eternity") that could be more concrete. The final paragraph has momentum but relies on telling ("She was not waiting for a change") rather than showing through action.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean prose with varied rhythm and strong information density, though occasional abstraction ("hidden architecture," "ephemeral scripture") slightly dulls immediacy. The final image of light exploding through the prism lands with concrete power, and no loops or scaffolding mar the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like "scarred forest firefighter whose body was a map of past infernos" but suffers from occasional overwriting ("patient, indifferent waltz of stars") and abstract phrasing ("translate that specific, searing pain into a universal language"). Some filter constructions ("She pictured," "She saw") dull immediacy in the reflection sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "acoustics of reality were different" and "concentrated possibility." Some density issues with stacked metaphors in paragraph 4 ("harmonizing timelines," "conducting probabilities," "hopeful chord"). Minor scaffold in "She had done it" followed by explanation. Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves clarity with selective density ("ivy-veiled passages," "being slowly digested by the relentless green"). Some filter verbs cluster mid-story ("She felt the weight," "she saw it was"), and "burden of its legacy" appears twice, creating minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some overwriting appears ("dusky harmony of twilight and impending renewal"). Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in "She painted a possibility..." repetition, though it builds accumulative pressure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("testament to flawed beauty," "terrifying vulnerability of hope") that could be more concrete. Some repetitive sentence structures in the middle section. The final paragraph achieves strong propulsion and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, though occasional overwriting appears ("universe of lost potential"). The repetition of "fractured grace" and some elevated diction in peak moments ("visceral prelude") creates minor friction, but information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, though occasional abstraction ("alarming serenity" appears twice, "beautiful, terrifying awareness") dulls precision. Strong rhythmic control in key passages. Minor redundancy in explaining the harvest's purpose reduces momentum slightly but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("dome's great bowl arching over her like the inside of a skull") and varies rhythm effectively, but suffers from occasional redundancy ("beautiful, ethical burden" appears twice) and some filter-heavy passages in the middle third. The opening and closing sentences anchor well, though middle sections contain scaffolding phrases that could be cut for momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The monarch veered, its graceful flight path jerked into a panicked zigzag" simultaneously shows cause, effect, and emotional register). Some filter verb accumulation during rescue ("she could not simply pull," "she began to knot") creates minor drag. The parallel structure of "transient root" and "blushing stillness" bookending the piece shows purposeful patterning rather than repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong sensory detail and varied rhythm. Deductions for the POV-breaking "forgiving yourself," some elevated diction drift ("snowmelt ardor" feels forced), and occasional abstraction ("transcribed memory, a soul given solid, metallic form"). The "technically gentle" repetition feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"Her name was her function, a cruel joke of programming"—but suffers from density issues in peak beats. The final paragraph contains three metaphors in rapid succession (seed cracking, circuit to ecosystem, walking/being the path) that slightly muddle rather than clarify. Some template phrasing appears ("precisely playful" used twice identically). Information density is generally strong with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("dusky harmony," "cavernous husk") and there's mild repetition of "covenant" and "devotion." The mathematical precision language effectively mirrors character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Strong specific verbs ("groaning," "sheared," "snarled"). However, some abstract phrasing dulls impact: "meticulously laid traps of consequence" and "flowing with shifting grace" lean purple. The repeated "shift" variations risk oversaturation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with phrases like "soup-like haze that swallowed sound" and maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths. Some abstract formulations ("erasing boundaries," "synchronized breathing") and the slightly overwrought "solidified song" metaphor prevent higher scoring, but no loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("coiled like a pale serpent," "ceiling of green and gold") with strong rhythm variation. Some redundancy appears ("breach of contract was absolute" after showing destruction; "feisty spirit" echoing "endearingly feisty"). The "deciduous vows" explanation contains mild paraphrase loop between promise types.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting ("deep, philosophical panic began to bloom"). Information density high in most beats. Deductions for occasional purple patches and one instance of telling what's shown ("The inheritance was not a thing to be received").

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("books that seemed to be made of shadow and starlight") but suffers from abstract noun clusters and conceptual redundancy. Phrases like "singular focus," "scholarly pursuit," and "desperate rescue missions" feel scaffolded. The ending accumulates abstract concepts that blur precision.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and evocative imagery, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("ghost of gaudy paint," "blissfully aberrant") and abstract constructions that slow momentum. The final paragraph contains some redundancy as it restates the integration rather than letting the image carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations matching scene pressure. Information density wavers—some passages like "warmly methodical, a trait that soothed both anxious students and brittle parchment alike" do double work well, while others feel padded. Minor template cadence in "She saw... She wove... She did not pull." The final sentence attempts too much summary.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Some figurative density in peak beats ("flower of pure stillness petals unfurling") approaches overwriting but serves the mythic tone. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story functions.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied sentence structures. However, some overwriting appears ("thistle-blown hope on the edge of oblivion") and occasional register drift ("pervasive silence—a shard of hush lodged in the heart of the world") that doesn't fully match Elara's practical custodian perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves strong clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts, particularly in the whispers sequence. Minor issues include occasional overwriting ("perpetually, preemptively nostalgic" feels slightly redundant) and some elevated diction that occasionally strains ("glassine plain," "conjunction of her past self's hope"), but information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves solid momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks, particularly in the climactic sequence. However, abstract phrases ("gravity of hopelessness," "profound melancholy") and slight redundancy in describing the fortress's despair create minor drag, while the preparation sequence could compress further without losing essential information.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density is high in the vision sequence. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("transition periods in climate"/"transition periods of the heart") and occasional elevated diction strains against the intimate scale ("ethereal light," "reverent"). The "texture of time" phrase recurs without always adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some overwriting appears ("roaring, vertical silence that tore at her soul"). Minor template cadence in "She wrote of..." repetition. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple purposes.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean with strong sensory detail ("glass panels refracting the twilight into a thousand muted colors").

Some repetition of "vaulting hush" and slight overwriting in places ("fluidly logical grace") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The history of his people's long retreat was laid bare in sediment"), though some template phrasing appears ("He took a steadying breath, his heart a drum against his ribs"). Minor redundancy in the final paragraph repeats the futuristic nostalgia/wisely adventurous pairing, and occasional elevated register ("nascent sun") strains against established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The silence was a presence") but some overwriting in metaphorical density ("tender shadow keeper," "guardian of this fading threshold"). The "ghost in your lungs" and breath sequence achieves strong propulsion. Minor template cadence in "She had come to forget, but the memory..." structure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several paraphrase loops damage momentum: "translate pressure into diamonds" concept repeated without advancement, "virtuously mischievous" used twice identically. Template cadence in "She understood...She focused...She held...She envisioned" sequence. The prose achieves moments of clarity but scaffolding and repetitive stems prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum. Several instances of overwriting ("sepia reading room," "liquid amber," "gilded cage") and some abstract phrasing ("bridge of intuition," "weight to be understood"). The filter verb "she realized" and similar constructions appear multiple times, creating minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("armor had grown heavier with silence than with battle"), though some elevated diction occasionally obscures ("negotiation with the unstable ground"). Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks that mirror Silas's discoveries, with lines like "The dust would continue to fall, but he would always look for the patterns within it" doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing ("fractured mosaic of what might have been," "monument to loss") and repetitive constructions around dust weaken precision.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts during action sequences. Minor redundancies appear ("quiet, meticulous" and later "swift and silent" feel template-adjacent) and the opening contains slight abstraction, but information density remains high and the searchlight sequence demonstrates excellent propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm that matches the story's meditative pace. Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Minor template cadence appears in "She played... She saw... She stood" sequence, and some figurative language borders on over-density ("radiant grotto in mist," "aural threads stitching"), but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("Understanding washed over Elara, a profound and terrifying clarity"). Minor template cadence in "She looked at... She looked at..." construction. Strong opening and closing images bracket the piece effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong opening and closing lines. Information density high in pattern descriptions. However, some overwriting appears: "maelstrom of dried oak and brittle maple" feels slightly purple; "The frantic dance of the leaves wasn't chaos; it was a pattern" borders on telling what could be shown. Some filter constructions ("she realized," "she understood") dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "The foundry, once a place of violent heat and shaping, was now a chapel of quiet and water." However, abstract phrases like "numinous wonder" and "factually mystical" lack concrete grounding, and some metaphorical density ("luminous regret," "chapel of quiet") approaches oversaturation without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though some abstract phrasing ("luminous ache," "fractured echoes") verges on overwriting. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in middle section ("The soul's form... It was... Then another...") but recovers for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong momentum with vivid sensory detail and varied syntax. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("living cartography of his own pain"), some abstract phrasing ("rootedly tethered"), and slight register drift into clinical language ("proprioceptively enhanced," "trauma response"). The mathematical metaphors occasionally strain clarity but mostly serve the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("web of rope bridges and suspended platforms") and there's occasional abstraction ("the weight of entire cultures"). The final paragraph achieves strong propulsion and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some minor repetition ("Leo" appears frequently as subject) and occasional filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "crystalline trees bearing fruit of bound knowledge" and effective rhythm variation. Some abstract phrasing ("negotiable reality," "raw, un-cataloged feeling") occasionally dulls immediacy. Minor repetition of "perfect/perfection" could be trimmed, though it serves thematic purpose. The closing transformation sequence maintains propulsion despite complex concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong information density. However, several instances of abstract labeling ("burnished sorrow" appears multiple times) and some redundancy in the mirror-covering sequence. The phrase "reimagine an entire civilization" repeats without variation. Final paragraph maintains momentum despite these issues.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("fingers, stained with oil and time, danced") and some abstract phrasing ("metaphorical darkness that seeped"). The "explain-everything" tendency appears in phrases like "a metaphorical darkness" rather than letting the image work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves strong clarity with purposeful rhythm variations, though several instances of elevated diction ("psychometry reading," "residual memories") and some conceptual redundancy around the seeking/finding theme reduce momentum. The description "hinged awakenings" repeats without evolving its meaning, and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The world did not dissolve so much as it layered itself"). However, several instances of telling over showing ("She realized the archway was a nexus") and some abstract phrasing ("perpetually learning the archway's secrets") that could be more concrete. The "turbine-hum reverie" metaphor strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean with varied rhythm, though some passages tend toward density ("fractured through centuries-old silica and color").

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("releasing a scent of honey and extinction"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("woolen silence," "velvet disquiet," "shroud") and occasional register elevation. The "curator of annihilation" phrase feels slightly forced. Information density is high and propulsion maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "texture" and "inheritance" that builds meaning. Some figurative density in peak moments ("wild serenity," "controlled storm of intention") borders on overwriting. The "granular" description of time effectively makes abstract concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts matching emotional beats. Some overwriting appears ("sleeping serpent," "held breath") and the phrase "credibly curious" feels forced, but information density remains high and momentum sustains through the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("silent song he had finally learned to hear") but suffers from abstract scaffolding ("cultivation of a flourishing stillness," "profound urge"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("keeper of stillness"/"preserve the silence"). Information density is moderate with several sentences doing single duty.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong information density. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("pale and shimmering," "silent, frantic ballet") and elevated diction that occasionally drifts from POV register ("tangible symbol of the symbiotic oath"). Some filter-verb clusters ("He understood," "He knew") dull immediacy in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and selective detail, though some phrases edge toward overwriting ("texture of time passing" appears twice, "anticipated mysteries" feels forced). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. The clarity at closure remains untouched by these minor issues.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the rescue sequence. However, abstract phrases like "harmonizing discord" and "fractured moment" lean purple, and some paraphrase loops appear ("beautiful incomplete" echoes across multiple paragraphs without adding pressure).

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for filter-verb clustering ("She felt," "She showed them") during the consciousness exchange and some abstract phrasing ("deep-time memories") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum. However, some overwrought phrases ("bronze quiet settling over the stone," "luminous skeptic") and minor redundancy in describing the path reduce clarity. The amber-lens sequence achieves strong propulsion through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines like "each a tiny ark holding a potential forest" doing multiple jobs. Strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition ("fertilize") that pays off thematically. Minor deductions for slight overwriting in "indigo bleeding into the horizon" and one instance of simultaneity confusion in the bird-feeding sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose achieves strong density with lines doing multiple jobs - "His motivation, a faint but persistent hum in his blood" works metaphorically while staying embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("temporally stretched by the residual field into luminous brushstrokes"). However, some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("profound confusion into something resembling exploration") and occasional redundancy ("beautiful and horrifying" followed by extended description of the same quality).

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong moments like "the chime of falling icicles" and "a tiny, swirling galaxy, a mote of pure potential," though some template patterns emerge ("She was here for," "She had to," "She crept forward"). Minor paraphrase loops appear: "To embrace the unknown was not to steal it, but to protect it. She had come to take, but now she had to amend." Information density remains solid with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations and strong opening/closing lines. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("whispering gallery," "luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra" cluster densely) and occasional abstraction ("archive a world in flux"). Information density is high and sentences advance multiple purposes, though some figurative language could be pruned.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "a blanket of calm to smother the hidden thunder." However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("She had not just known this language; she had helped create it" restates rather than advances). The extended vision sequence contains some template cadence that could be more varied.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good sentence variety and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is solid with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("tapestry of suspended breath"), some template phrasing ("Piece by piece," "And then he saw it"), and abstract constructions that could be more concrete ("fruitless churn").

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "forged hush" and "absorbent silence." Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("canyon of endless echoes," "towers of bone," "pale spire in mist" all in opening). Template construction in "He had devised...He believed" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The workshop shuddered, a gear slipping as a particularly violent wave struck" delivers action, setting degradation, and time pressure simultaneously. Some metaphor density in peak beats ("quilt memories," "stitch in time," "painful suture") slightly slows momentum. The final paragraph's philosophical summary ("She had not saved the world. She had done something else.") edges toward telling but maintains imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("quays... weathered wood and restless water"), but some overwriting appears in the cave description ("profound silence, a temporary eternity"). Minor template cadence in "She painted..." sequence, though it builds purposeful accumulation. The "visual echo" metaphor strains slightly, and "intimately aloof" reads as prompt-residue.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting ("vulgar shock," "fierce, quiet need") and one template structure ("It was this... It was a method..."). Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions.

Deduction for three instances of elevated diction ("fractured grace," "chaotic, truthful hum," "resonator designed to amplify") that create mild register drift, and one paraphrase loop ("The truth of it was a scream in her skull" following the flood of history).

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in discovery sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("fierce, internal light," "blinding, golden light"). The transition from surface to cavern flows well, and the final image lands effectively, but phrases like "empirically intuitive" and "conceptual doorway" occasionally feel workshopped rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Information density high in atmospheric sections. Some redundancy: "silent, urgent command" and "hollow echo" could be tightened. The climbing sequence effectively varies sentence length for breathless effect. Final paragraph contains slight template cadence with repeated "The [noun]" structures.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("density of presence," "palette of resolve") and mild overwriting in figurative language.

    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of telling over showing ("profound understanding," "ordinary miracles") and some repetitive phrasing around sensory loss. The extended reflection paragraph about her future practice lacks scenic grounding. Information density is moderate but could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("shower of invisible, effervescent dust") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most high-pressure sentences. Phrases like "alchemy of transformation" and "failing bellows" accumulate without always advancing pressure, though clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong moments ("last light bled from the sky"), though some template constructions appear ("She reached for...She began to pull"). Information density is generally high, but filter constructions ("she did not offer") occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in "She moved with a wanderingly exact precision, her path seemingly aimless yet inevitably correct." Some abstract phrasing ("delicate tapestry of recorded existence") and repetitive constructions in the middle section slightly diminish immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, particularly in the longer descriptive passages about the disc contrasted with shorter dialogue exchanges.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good information density and varied syntax. Some elevated diction in the vision sequence ("pure understanding, delivered through the steeped connection") and occasional abstraction ("the veil between what was and what could be grew thin"). The writing achieves momentum through purposeful repetition of key images rather than forward drive.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "elusive disaster-relief logistician, a ghost who appeared" redundantly establishes the same trait. Template constructions like "She would not just...She would use it to..." and abstract summations ("distributing grace") replace concrete imagery. Strong opening and closing images partially compensate, but middle sections lose propulsive clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"her touch reading the raised ink" establishes blindness, profession, and method simultaneously. Strong syntactic variety and sensory specificity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm variation. Information density is good - most sentences advance multiple layers.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves solid clarity with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm, particularly in the climactic transformation. However, several abstract phrases weaken precision ("wild and yearning thing," "resigned acceptance") and some metaphors strain ("prisoner in a cage without bars"). The final paragraph's syntax effectively mirrors the transformation's fluidity.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm in the performance sections and evocative specificity ("shavings collecting like pale tears"). However, abstract phrases like "cultivate lightness in grief" and "emotional void he cultivated" create register drift, and some sentences edge toward overwriting ("terrifying" could be shown through action rather than stated).

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The hum clarifies into a complex chord, a music of geology and time"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("pure frequency," "history of pressure and ice") approaches overwriting but remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery ("marble eye," "wilting petals...magnificent, complex structure"). Some abstract phrasing weakens immediacy ("curtains of intention," "veils of perception"). The "genuinely artificial" repetition feels slightly forced rather than pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, but several template phrases ("steady curiosity ignited into a focused blaze," "swelling inside her") and abstract descriptors ("strange, analogue silence"). Some paraphrase loops around the cultural pattern concept. Information density good in discovery sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("perfect geometric ache against the darkening indigo sky") with strong information density. However, some figurative density in peak beats borders on overwriting ("atoms of nostalgia," "psychic residue," "shards of glass" in quick succession), and phrases like "steadily unpredictable anguish" create mild paradox without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong opening ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer of the Aerie") and varied sentence structures. Information density high in descriptive passages. Deductions for repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in the research sequence and some abstract phrasing ("tangible manifestation of creative potential") that could be more concrete. The closing image of the transformed stone lands with specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of precise beauty ("curled like a question mark," "cocoon of mist and light") with good information density. Some paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("It was not naivety to choose compassion; it was a conscious, difficult act of will" restates rather than advances).

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"viscous threads of anesthesia" conveys both physical and metaphorical release. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control throughout. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract middle section explaining the miracle's arrival, which could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("hushed thunder," "echoes steep"). Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple elements. Some template cadence in the vision sequence ("He saw," "He captured," "He had poured") costs points.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the sky seemed to bleed green and violet") but suffers from abstract density and occasional overwriting. Several passages loop conceptually ("trapped creativity"/"free that trapped creativity"). Filter-verb clusters appear ("she saw," "she felt," "she finally understood") and abstract phrasing dulls immediacy in places ("profound peace of one who has finally come home").

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong moments ("The world was a monochrome of ash and regret") but suffers from abstract passages that lose specificity ("gently weaving the fraying threads into coherent patterns"). Some paraphrase loops appear in the sorting section, and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("She began to charm the chaos").

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "metallic susurrus" and the temple unraveling sequence. Information density varies—some passages like the "probable miracle" explanation feel slightly redundant. Minor issues with abstract phrasing ("wild frontier of your mind") and occasional filter verb clusters. The "a ocean" typo and some elevated diction ("susurrus") that might exceed POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but occasional redundancy appears: "silent backwaters where the only sound was the dip of an oar" could tighten. Strong rhythm in "They were three figures of weathered stone and river-reeds" but some filter constructions ("Elias looked up") could strengthen. Information density generally high with multi-layered imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "silent, white weight of the world." Some redundancy appears in adjacent descriptions of Leo's silence and occasional filter verb stacks ("she could see," "she looked"). The phrase "seraphically mundane" feels forced rather than organic to the voice. Information density is solid but could be tighter in the middle exposition about the Fortress.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and strong imagery. Information density is high, particularly in the dissolution sequence. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("profound black," "profound precision") and some elevated diction that borders on purple ("perfume of graceful collapse"). The closing image effectively returns to Elara's continued quest.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("pebble dropped into the still pond"). Strong information density in discovery sequences. Template cadence appears briefly ("He began to compare...He had to assemble") but doesn't pervade. Final paragraph achieves strong rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong imagery. However, several issues: the garbled characters "赋予它" break immersion, "tuning fork for her very soul" verges on purple prose, and some repetitive phrasing around "thunderous serenity." The final paragraph contains some template cadence ("She had given them...And in the silent...They had discovered").

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the ritual sequence. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor weakness in repetitive constructions ("She was...," "It was...") and some filter-verb clustering mid-story. The closing image resonates powerfully: "a song of a future finally beginning."

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "a woman quietly talented in the art of going unnoticed" and the visceral panic sequence. Some filter verb clustering ("She noticed," "She heard") and mild overwriting in metaphorical density ("fossil of lost happiness"). Information density good but occasional redundancy in trauma description.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several overwriting issues weaken momentum: redundant phrasing ("fractured pieces"/"fragmented reality"), purple patches ("luminescent ache, a soft, sorrowful glow"), and abstract summaries ("exercise in futility"). The rhetorical questions feel scaffolded rather than voice-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The black pool did not just spread; it organized" advances action while establishing the ink's agency. Some elevated diction in peak moments ("sublime complexity," "ephemeral patterns") but serves the conceptual nature. Minor repetition of "serene anger" but functions as character anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong compression ("The truth was a live wire in her hand") but suffers from abstract density in places ("capable of thawing the frozen past into a chaotic present").

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts marking tension changes. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("senselessly perceptive dread," "malevolent blue light"), some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete, and minor redundancy in explaining the bone slivers' purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong sentence variety and rhythm that supports the dreamlike atmosphere. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("personal solar system of regrets," "gravitational tension") and some filter constructions ("she felt each elliptical path"). The final paragraph achieves strong momentum with concrete action verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story functions. However, some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("the dissonance of old guilt," "captured and catalogued absences") and occasional redundancy appears ("finally, properly, laid to rest"). The "time folds in on itself" paragraph risks opacity without fully earning its compression.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures, with purposeful figurative language ("ghosts of a hundred rainbows," "sugar in rain"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for abstract phrasing that occasionally obscures concrete action ("lilac unease...clung to the skin"), some elevated register drift ("palpable twilight"), and minor repetition of "emergent hush" concept without sufficient variation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("cradle empathy in arms of steel"). Several instances of abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("wave of profound connection," "sacred weight of the moment"). Template cadence appears in places ("She looked... She walked... She stopped") though rhythm varies adequately overall.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some abstract phrasing ("fractured timeline," "ancient grief," "pull of possibility") and repetitive constructions ("She was...," "He was...") in the opening. Strong closing image. Minor template cadence in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied sentence structures. Some elevated diction ("gossamer web," "fractally precise") approaches purple prose but serves the artistic subject matter. The phrase "willowglass hope" feels forced. Strong momentum maintained throughout with no significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structures, particularly in the discovery sequence. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves lyrical density with phrases like "amber warehouse, a vast, dusty cathedral carved into the base of the towering cliffs." Some figurative language borders on over-density ("fraying at the edges," "metaphysical dust," "syllable of the scrambled echo" in close succession). Minor scaffold appears in "deep, meditative connection that left her quietly inspired, filled with a profound sense of purpose."

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the mist clung to the pines like a shroud"). Some metaphor density in opening that doesn't fully pay off ("map of old pain").

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Evocative phrases like "swallowing whorls" and "spindrift serenity" create atmospheric density. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("needle dipping and rising like a tiny oar in a woolen sea") and occasional abstract phrasing ("distill complexity into essence"). The prose serves the accumulative mode but occasionally tips into purple territory.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("viscous flattening of chimney smoke"). However, abstract phrasing appears in peak beats ("profound kindness," "selfless grace") and some paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("The place had absorbed it...bending its very nature toward that moment"). Template cadence in places ("He saw...He saw...He saw").

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, but several overwrought phrases ("luminous harbor by moonlight," "celestial lock being picked") and repetitive constructions weaken momentum. The paraphrase loop "protected vulnerability" appears twice verbatim, and some metaphors strain credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "silence...was a physical presence." However, "brittle awakening" repetition, filter verb clusters ("she felt," "she noticed," "she realized"), and the abstract "raison d'être" create minor friction. Information density is high but some scaffolding remains.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("a twig spiral held together by mud and hope"). Some overwriting appears ("the singular truth woven into the chaos of human feeling") and repetitive abstract phrasing around connection/thread metaphors. Final paragraph contains multiple restatements of the connection theme.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose achieves clarity with technical elements like "recalibrating the massive dish" and "piggybacking her own low-frequency transmission." However, abstract phrases like "organized chaos," "ethereal grit," and "sublime science and raw determination" feel templated. The lockpick metaphor works well, but "silent, high-stakes game" and "weight of her gamble" are stock thriller phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with effective variation, but several issues: redundant phrasing ("perfect sphere"/"perfect prison"), abstract constructions ("wistful rebellion" appears twice), and some overwriting in emotional beats. Strong moments like "a single, sustained chord played through the reverberation of a lonely church organ" show control. The final paragraph contains some summary that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful variation, though some elevated diction occasionally strains ("profoundly, incurably prosopagnosic"). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple elements.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("gleaming with a dull, verdigris light"). Some redundancy in "spongey dread" repetition and occasional overwriting ("nervously confident" appears twice). The final paragraph contains some scaffold phrasing ("Some balances, once thought permanently broken") that could be more compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and evocative imagery, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("the ashes of 'never'") and abstract constructions that slow momentum. Some phrases like "amnesty that forgave no sins" strain for effect. The final paragraph's density of metaphor ("sculpted sky," "silver and glass") slightly obscures the clarity of the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression, though figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("serpent of peeling paint and shattered dreams"). The repetitive "circling" metaphor across paragraphs 5-6 creates minor redundancy, and "dusky harmony" appears twice without evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Some overwriting in metaphorical language ("subconscious cartographies," "witching hour when the world was soft and suggestible"). A few instances of telling over showing ("Understanding dawned, cold and brilliant") but momentum remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax, though some metaphorical density in high-pressure beats ("flash-frozen," "catastrophic backlash," "swirling orchard vortex") and occasional redundancy ("cold failure" after establishing failure). The "greatest thing she had lost" construction in the final paragraph creates mild template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The air itself was thick with anxious elation"), but suffers from abstract scaffolding like "cosmic adjustment" and "metaphysical wounds" that dulls immediacy. Some template cadence appears in the scar-linking sequence ("On she went, from scar to scar"), preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong moments of clarity and momentum, particularly in sensory description and action sequences. However, several issues accumulate: abstract telling ("a place of dusky resolve"), repetitive constructions ("She was not a warrior; her strength was in preservation"), and some overwriting in figurative language. The entity's nature remains vague, described only in abstract terms that reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("His throne was a cracked pleather chair, and his crown was the dust"). Some minor redundancy appears in the middle reflection sections, but sentence variety and rhythmic control remain solid throughout with no significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong sentence variety and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the opening's weighted silence. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the ritual sequence. Information density is high with most sentences advancing atmosphere, character, or the smelting process. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("concentrated memory," "metaphysical pressure") and mild overwriting in places where concrete imagery would strengthen the moment. The "violent act made serene" construction feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("profound, dead silence," "resonant hush that amplified"). Information density is high in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though "daringly methodical" repetition and some abstract phrasing ("raw solace," "fragile and desperate thing") create minor friction. The final paragraph's momentum accelerates effectively. Some filter phrases ("She understood now") but used purposefully for revelation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some abstract phrases slow peak beats ("weight of silent knowledge," "pure, exuberant joy"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction borders on overwriting but stays mostly within the POV's lexicon. The final paragraph effectively recharges earlier motifs without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("a sieve" for destiny), but several instances of overwriting ("fruited sorrow for something beautiful and doomed") and redundancy ("beautiful future" followed immediately by explaining the same vision).

    Prose shows high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"crystalline mouth opened to the endless heavens" establishes setting, tone, and otherworldliness simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak moments ("breathing rhythm," "banked fire") but coherent within the lyric mode. Clean of loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of overwriting ("profound stillness thick with the scent," "perpetual mist from the falls collected") and one template construction ("She saw... She wrote... She looked"). The final paragraph contains some redundancy between "truly content" and the explained contentment source.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, but occasional density issues - "the cloak of doubt fell away from him, not discarded, but finally understood" feels slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("silent explosion of geometry") and slight register elevation in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong sensory detail, particularly in descriptions like "shifting cloud of starlings that twisted and coiled like smoke." Minor issues include some filter constructions ("He felt," "He saw," "He understood") that slightly distance the reader, and occasional abstract phrasing ("desperate cry from a lost time") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Information density is good - most sentences advance multiple elements. Some redundancy exists ("focused care"/"focused on the simple task") and occasional overwriting ("galaxy of enforced creativity"). The closing paragraph effectively varies sentence length for impact.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery, though density occasionally overwhelms: "resonant tone began to hum through the pier, a sound felt more than heard" works, but accumulation of abstract concepts ("covenant," "vow," "inheritance") in paragraph 5 slows momentum. Clean grammar throughout with effective paragraph variation.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though abstract phrases like "wavelength align with purpose" and "distill meaning from chaos" lack concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths matching emotional intensity ("He yanked the cord" vs. flowing descriptions).

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose shows strong moments ("miniature lightning flickered and silent clouds churned") but contains some elevated abstractions ("fragile new truth," "secret geography of hope"). Information density is generally high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor scaffold in thematic statements reduces momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery, though density occasionally tips toward overwriting ("scabrous metal beneath," "bruised purple sky").

Minor register drift appears in phrases like "halo fragment" and "sacred splinter" that feel imposed rather than voice-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"equations of celestial mechanics were shelved beside verses of longing" establishes setting, theme, and tone simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the library description. Information density high in lines like "a story ended without a satisfying final chapter" that advance multiple threads. Deduction for filter-verb clustering ("she noted," "she perceived," "she separated") in the thread-untangling sequence and slight overwriting in metaphorical density ("ghostly cathedral," "lethargic fish," "swirling motes").

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, several abstract phrases lack specificity ("beautiful, broken symphony," "raw data of emotion"), and there's some repetition of concept words (voice/voiceless appears 8 times). The "tinkersong" coinage feels forced rather than organic.

The final paragraph maintains momentum through the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clear prose with some redundancy ("sweet-smelling groves," "gnarled trees" could be tighter). Occasional overwriting ("brambled thing, tangled with fear") and filter verbs reduce immediacy. The final paragraph's "celestial mist" sequence borders on purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several abstract noun clusters slow momentum ("cascade of failures," "nested patterns of cause and effect," "pure intention").

    Generally clean prose with strong imagery like "dust motes dance in the beams of bottled moonlight." Minor repetition of "story" and "glass" variants. The phrase "palpable thing" in the opening is weak. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong sensory precision ("sun-warmed stone," "crystalline frost") with varied syntax. However, "sandpapering rough memories" appears verbatim three times, and "emotionally contagious" reads as template language. The phrase "sturdy brittle" lacks clear meaning. Information density remains high with purposeful paragraph variation.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose rhythms vary effectively, particularly in the repair sequence's building momentum. Information density is generally high though "borrowed starlight" appears twice without added meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the silver light carving stark shadows into the ancient rock walls." However, several abstract formulations weaken momentum: "period of profound transformation," "deliberate unmooring," and the explanatory "He failed, or so everyone thought" creates mild scaffold. The filter verb "She gasped as another crashed over her" dulls immediacy in a peak beat.

    Prose achieves strong information density with lines like "avalanchingly quiet pressure that settled deep in Elara's bones" doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in the opening paragraph ("presence," "avalanchingly quiet") without full payoff. Minor template tendency in "She saw... She observed... She witnessed" sequence, though varied enough to avoid mechanical repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. However, abstract phrasing accumulates ("profound and terrifying sorrow," "lucid turbulence," "heartbreaking peace") without sufficient concrete grounding.

Deductions for redundant phrasing ("calm defiance" appears twice), some overwriting in metaphorical language ("spider spins its web" feels ornamental), and the final paragraph's abstract summary tendency rather than maintaining concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clean, propulsive prose with high information density—nearly every line advances discovery or atmosphere. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, particularly in the gravity navigation sequence. Minor repetition of "gleaming silence" works as purposeful bookending. No loops or scaffolding detected.

Minor paraphrase loops appear ("The masterpiece wasn't the factory. It was the healing" followed by explanatory restatement). Information density is mostly strong, with lines doing multiple jobs, but occasional redundancies prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition of key terms. Information density is generally high. However, several instances of filter verbs ("she understood," "she remembered") and some template cadence in the middle sections ("She had to...She had to") reduce immediacy. The final paragraph's syntax effectively mirrors the spreading sound.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the slow crackle of a spine bending, the soft sigh of skin settling"). Some repetitive structures appear ("He knew... He would... He was") creating mild template cadence. The typo "全部 gone" and occasional abstract phrasing ("profound and aching sense") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"the perfect, imagined resonance of a leaf touching the earth"—but occasionally overwrites with stacked modifiers.

Minor deduction for slight overwriting in descriptive passages and one instance of telling ("Her focus was absolute").

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several issues: redundant phrasing ("yearned only for...yearned for"), abstract descriptors ("profound sorrow," "nostalgic innovation" used twice), and the final paragraph's excessive scaffolding that restates themes. The bone-setting sequence shows strong concrete detail that elevates the score.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Minor density issues in figurative language ("pearl of stillness in the clamoring world") and one instance of elevated register drift, but the closing sequence achieves exceptional clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose shows strong moments like "cavernous hall, once humming with servers, was now a sanctuary of green silence" with good rhythm variation. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "quietly proactive diligence"/"quietly proactive nature" and repetitive "she saw/felt" constructions. The water pattern description approaches purple prose without quite crossing over.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some abstract phrasing ("shapes of different hopes," "feral nexus") and occasional overwriting ("swirling hush, thick with salt and the murmur of things just beyond sight") reduce clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"withered orchard deep in a subarctic crater" establishes setting, atmosphere, and constraint simultaneously. Rhythm varies naturally between longer descriptive passages and shorter action beats. Minor figurative density in places ("veined with frozen green") but serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose demonstrates strong syntactic variety and information density, with most sentences advancing multiple story functions. Some figurative density in non-peak moments ("bled a deep, melancholic gold") and occasional academic register ("theoretical concept she had only read about") create minor friction without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("a library of sorrows"), though "boundary-lessly trapped" appears twice verbatim.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("fractured stillness," "kinetic lagoon"). Some filter verb accumulation ("She could never be sure," "She had heard") and occasional overwriting in figurative density. The "temporal soup" and similar metaphors occasionally strain but don't break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure, but several artifacts reduce the score: metaphor density in paragraph 2 ("graveyard of grandeur," "maze of intentions," "hopeful geometry"), some template cadence in the work sequence ("She cleaned... She felt... She watched"), and abstract phrasing ("carnival left town," "functional purpose") that could be more concrete. The closing achieves strong resonance despite these issues.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though "excruciatingly gentle" repeats verbatim and some phrases edge toward purple ("crystal whispering forecourt," "petrichor nostalgia"). The final paragraph maintains density despite complex metaphorical layering.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm shifts—short, tactile sentences during salvaging, longer contemplative passages for discovery. Some abstract phrasing ("quiet pilgrimage," "canvas of sound") and minor redundancy in thematic statements. The final paragraph's "salvaging the truth they often drowned" provides resonant closure despite slight overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density, but several instances of elevated diction ("oceanic hush," "profound shift") and near-paraphrase loops ("The silence was no longer empty, but full of weaving" echoes prior material).

Final image of brass flowers turning effectively closes without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("black sand from the volcanic beach was cool between Elara's fingers") with good sentence variety. However, several instances of elevated register drift ("a gritty testament," "sentinel on the lagoon's bank," "participated in its renewal") and some abstract phrasing ("vibration...with her soul") create occasional distance. The "low, thrumming note of resilience" metaphor strains slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is generally strong, though some abstract phrases ("realistically imaginative," "sidereal patience") create opacity. Minor template cadence in middle section ("She saw...She circled...She began") but recovers for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean with varied rhythm and strong imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. However, some abstract phrasing ("approximates infinity in its endless, repeating loops") and the repeated "again, and again, and again" feel slightly overwrought. The final paragraph's conceptual density could be more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The ribbon's path, she realized, led to the old botanical conservatory"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("vibrant, decaying greenery") and minor repetition of "thundering calm" prevent higher scoring, but momentum remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "cold, sharp-toothed surf" and "bruised sky." Template cadence appears in father flashback ("She saw...She saw...") and some abstract phrasing ("profound dissonance," "tangible manifestation") dulls immediacy. Information density high in descriptive passages but looser in reflective sections.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong control but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching ("neat rows between the headstones," "twin flags forever fallen," "plush darkness"). Some redundancy appears ("cool and still," "patient and sure"). The clarity remains intact but the ornamentation occasionally obscures momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though some figurative density in places ("pregnant with possibility," "house of cards"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in "She wrote not... She wrote the..." construction, though it creates intentional parallel structure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though several instances of template cadence ("She would then... Only then would she...") and some abstract phrasing ("thistled calm," "secretly luminous") that borders on overwriting. Information density is high and the final image resonates, but minor scaffold elements prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "brittle, terrifyingly beautiful mask" conveys fragility, danger, and allure simultaneously. Some template cadence in "They saw... They whispered... They did not know" sequence. Final paragraph's "simpler, starker truth" edges toward summary but recovers through the concrete image of dust on the rockers.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves clarity with moments of elegance ("library of the sunken city," "sandpaper serenity"), though some scaffolding appears ("He agonized over the weight of it"). Information density is generally strong, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation, though "expectantly resigned" appears twice unnecessarily. Some elevated diction ("vitriolic broadsides," "cacophony of isolation") slightly strains in places. The musical metaphors integrate well without becoming overwrought. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery, though some metaphoric density slows momentum ("weeping orange tears," "drum against her ribs" in close succession). Template structures appear briefly ("She took...She selected...She steeled"). Information density is generally high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though some passive constructions ("was sent," "was complete") weaken momentum. Minor paraphrase loop with "preserved a piece of wonder"/"kept the wonder" in closing. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose has moments of genuine beauty but suffers from periodic overwriting and abstract phrasing. "Creeping normality of silence" and "inadvertent archaeologist of atmosphere" feel forced. Some template repetition in discovery sequences. The final paragraph achieves good momentum and the last line lands well. Information density is generally strong but occasional purple patches slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("crushing pressure of the forgotten underwater city garden"). However, template cadence appears in the revelation sequence ("It was not...It saw...The three hundred and forty-two pearls were not..."). Some paraphrase loops around the certainty/revelation cycle. The "tone animate lifeless" construction feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good information density, but several abstract constructions dilute immediacy: "boundless confinement," "balancedly daring," "perpetual motion." Some philosophical passages edge toward overwriting without full payoff. The "soundless sonic boom" works well as paradox, but other oxymorons feel forced.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves moments of luminous imagery ("moon-tipped brush... filaments of pure silver that seemed to drink the moonlight") but suffers from abstract passages and some repetitive phrasing around "methodically hopeful." The final paragraph contains scaffolding ("She had not needed to prove... She only needed to give them") that dulls momentum. Information density varies, with some sentences doing multiple jobs while others restate.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "melting on their tongues, the taste a memory jolting them awake." Some figurative density in early paragraphs ("mist of the great waterfall forever," "thaw the ice around our hearts") creates mild overwriting. The "rosewater dread" coinage works but "cloying, sentimental sorrow...sharp, metallic fear" explanation diminishes its power through redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some elevated register drift ("coalescence of possibility," "nascent star"). Information density is high in the assembly sequence. Minor redundancy in explaining the yoyo's purpose twice. The final paragraph's "terrible and beautiful" and repeated "clockwork" phrases edge toward ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the paradoxical confessions. However, several instances of overwriting ("symphony of repulsive allure," "belly of this rotting place") and some filter-verb clustering ("she understood," "she found"). The repeated "lingering luminance" works as pattern but borders on precious.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("His world was an orchard afloat"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("restless euphony," "soaring arpeggio") but it serves the musical conceit. Minor template cadence in "He knelt...He placed...He sketched" sequence deducts slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though "sunwashed dread" appears twice and some metaphors strain ("weeping wound across the iron"). Information density is solid with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. The final paragraph rushes through several transformations that could use more breathing room.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some academic phrasing ("cross-referencing forgotten diaries with economic ledgers") slows momentum. Strong opening and closing lines. Minor scaffold in the parallel-drawing explanation runs slightly long but serves closure. Information density adequate but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for repetitive "He [verb]" structures in the middle section and slightly overwrought metaphors ("hushed blaze," "jaws of oblivion") that occasionally muddle clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "reclaimed stillness"/"forced pause," "honest origins"/"truest version," and the final paragraph over-explains Elara's future intentions. Information density drops in exposition-heavy middle sections about the competing histories.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though "luminous torment" repetition and some elevated diction ("perpetual cloud layer," "conflicting gravitational dance") occasionally strain the register. Information unfolds cleanly through action. The transformation sequence maintains clarity despite complexity. Minor scaffold in "She knew what she had to do."

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the opening's compression of backstory and characterization. Clean syntax variation and momentum throughout. Minor deduction for slight abstraction around "intangibly tangible" and one instance of elevated diction ("scoured her soul").

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum through action sequences. Information density high in technical passages. Deduction for metaphor density in transcendence beat ("symphony of light," "resonant wave," "universal song") and slight template phrasing ("fingers danced across the console").

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with effective variation, though some paraphrase loops appear ("beautiful lies"/"beautiful lie," guilt referenced multiple times similarly). Strong information density in the memory-creation sequence. The final paragraph's rhythm effectively slows to match Elara's dawning realization, though "deep, tempered regret" edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("windblown parapet," "swirling ghosts") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("furrowed hush," "desolate spine"). Some redundancy in emotional labeling ("mistrust as thick as fog" followed by "rushing stream of their hostility"). The extended metaphor in paragraph 6 borders on purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("The compass on the deck began to tremble, its needle twitching erratically"). However, several instances of overwriting appear: "psychic weight," "guttering faith," and redundant emotional labeling. The final paragraph contains some scaffold phrasing ("perfectly correct," "arrived nowhere, and everywhere") that dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though the realization sequence contains abstract scaffolding ("Her own quest seemed small and selfish in comparison"). Strong opening and closing lines. Information density is high in the cave sequence but thins during the philosophical middle section where several sentences restate similar insights about choice and connection.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("grey of his pelt like storm clouds"). However, several abstract constructions weaken immediacy: "hollow echo of the spectacle," "reluctant metamorphosis," "cosmic intimacy." The phrase "paradoxically steady" appears twice without clear purpose. Some filter constructions ("she felt," "she saw") in the climactic merger reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff—"choking beauty," "sea of vapor," "vortex, beautiful and suffocating" cluster without advancing pressure. Some paraphrase loops appear: "willingly perplexed" repeated twice, emotional states restated rather than developed. Information density remains high overall with most lines serving multiple functions.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("crystalline residue that had outlasted the eyes that cried them"). Several instances of abstract telling ("profound sadness seeped into her," "strange peace settled") and some repetitive structures. The "shadow work" explanation and "key" metaphor feel slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("Their light caught the plumes of steam venting from the mountain's peak, illuminating them from within") but suffers from abstract loops ("fulfilling prophecies accidentally, setting in motion a chain of events") and some overwriting ("vibrant hush" appears twice as prompt-echo). Information density varies; the middle section particularly loses propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some instances of elevated diction ("profound and unexplained blackout," "lavish chambers") and occasional redundancy ("massive slab of ironoak banded with steel"). The phrase "calmly inventive" feels somewhat forced as a descriptor. Information density is strong in action sequences but occasionally lapses into slight overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("a shimmering, silent river of green and violet") but suffers from abstract scaffolding ("a plea, a question, and a scaffold all at once"). Several template constructions appear ("He was placing," "He finished," "He understood"). Information density is uneven, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others merely assert.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("paper now soft as cloth") but occasionally overreaches with abstract formulations ("tempest of calm resolve"). Information density is generally high, though phrases like "profound affirmation" and "sublime clarity" edge toward telling what could be shown through image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some conceptual redundancy appears ("waiting was never passive; it was an act of sharpening the mind" restates rather than advances). Phrases like "fierce intelligence was always diplomatically fierce" create unnecessary loops, and "perfect, peaceful sense" in the conclusion feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("face like worn leather," "moon just beginning to clear the jagged skyline"). Some figurative density in places ("luminous fracture," "blooming resistance," "breaking into leaf and flower") without full payoff. The phrase "core of who he always was" tends toward abstraction where specificity would strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("cathedral of transit," "cartography of love etched in silver nitrate") but occasionally overreaches with density ("strategically creative" feels forced, "steely longing" borders on oxymoron). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story functions. Minor issues with abstract phrasing ("quiet obsession," "indifferent universe") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure. Information density is adequate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. However, several instances of elevated diction feel forced ("cerulean sea," "wellspring from which all island truths flowed"). Some redundancy in the dream sequence description that could be compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though several instances of elevated diction ("rhythmically placid," "resonant completion") and abstract phrasing ("leached the world of its meaning") create distance. The lace-reading sequence maintains strong momentum through concrete action, but some passages rely on conceptual summary over embodied detail.


== Grader: DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and paid off at closure. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts. Rhythm and syntax expertly modulate with the emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. One minor artifact: "a ghost of her former luminosity" risks cliché but is quickly redeemed by the concrete action that follows. Otherwise, the language is precise, propulsive, and free of loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously, with purposeful variation in structure and length. Read-aloud clarity is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exceptionally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in phrases like "soul of light," which, while beautiful, slightly softens the concrete precision that defines the voice elsewhere. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm that accelerates with scene needs. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, like the mountains as "barrier and jailer." No loops or scaffold artifacts; however, a minor register drift in "mournful choir" slightly clashes with the POV's lexicon, though it doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic variation and information density. Figurative language ("a scent like forgotten promises") is purposeful and consistent. A minor rhythm flatness occurs in the sentence beginning "The luminous mist touched the stone..." where a series of clauses creates a slight list-like effect, but this is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is densely poetic but maintains propulsion, with varied syntax and minimal scaffolding. A minor figurative strain exists in "luminous, geometric dust," but it doesn't obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, and information density is high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propulsive. Sentences are varied and purposeful, doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. Figurative language ("a song of resistance, a tune of hope played on cold, hard iron") is potent and earned. No loops, artifacts, or muddle to detract from the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density and a varied, rhythmic cadence that supports the pressure of the dive. Figurative language ("a silent, perpetual scream," "shattering prism of obsidian and ice") is potent and coherent. A single minor scaffold phrase ("a battered marvel") is repeated but is pattern-taught and pays off, causing no material obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished, dense, and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity rather than obscuring it (e.g., "notes a silver thread"). Minor deduction for a slight register elevation in the opening line ("liquid treasure") which, while beautiful, feels slightly detached from the more grounded voice that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled with high information density. Minor deduction for slightly elevated figurative density in the peak beat ("violent, cracking, painful thawing heart") which, while effective, borders on stacking. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally crisp and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn (“transformative betrayal,” “obliteration of his very self”) and the phrase “firmly adaptive,” which feels slightly label-like. These do not significantly obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density with purposeful figurative language ("solitary pinprick of cold light," "coastline of quietude"). Read-aloud rhythm is generally strong but has minor syntactic uniformity in descriptive passages. One potential paraphrase loop: "summarizing silence" and "retell what she perceived" appear close together. No clarity issues at closure; final paragraph propels beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, dense, and purposeful, with high information density and zero scaffolding or loops. Figurative language ("like a palimpsest") is precise and serves the concept. The sentence-level rhythm is varied and effectively supports the escalating pressure of the overlapping perceptions, culminating in a clear, propulsive closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and propel the narrative forward ("The realization arrived after words became necessary"). Figurative language is precise and character-motivated ("eavesdropping on her own life"). No artifacts, loops, or scaffolded phrasing were detected. A masterclass in concision and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. A minor instance of potential register drift ("transcendent, impossible beauty") is forgivable as it services the climax and is earned by the preceding texture. The final paragraph is a masterclass in rhythmic control and image-making.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exemplary, with high information density, vivid sensory prose, and controlled rhythm that accelerates with the action. The description of the hologram as "a diagram of frozen mathematics" is a standout image. A single, minor instance of adjacent sentences with similar structure ("She pulled it. For a moment, nothing happened.") is the only hairline flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor instance of figurative stacking occurs in the climax ("threnodic chord," "vortex," "coalesced"), creating a slight muddle, but it does not significantly obscure the closure's clarity or impact.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and information density. A single minor artifact exists: the rhythm of "The weight of it was immense, a terrible anchor" slightly echoes the previous sentence's structure. This does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language ("a thick and smothering velvet") is potent and purposeful, not muddled. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with the ghost shift's manifestation. Zero loops, scaffold, or artifactual phrasing obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly purposeful, with excellent rhythmic variation. A minor instance of potential abstraction ("foundational pain") and a slightly over-stacked modifier ("beautiful decline") prevent a 9+ score, but these are hairline slips that do not harm closure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density, varied rhythm, and zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, heightening the climactic moment without obscuring clarity. "A perfect, physical loop from his past meeting this impossible present" is a standout line.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and propulsive, often doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The bronze quiet... was not a silence of absence, but of containment" establishes tone, setting, and theme). There are zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph's cadence shift beautifully supports the closure's conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally elegant and propulsive with high information density. However, a slight overwriting tendency appears in phrases like "the familiar enigma of his other life waiting" and "scattering light into a thousand fractals," which, while evocative, add a minor decorative layer. The rhythm is strong and no loops or scaffolding artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. A minor rhythmical flatness occurs in the high-pressure beat describing the entity's voice ("a sound like grinding glass"), which slightly disrupts the sentence-level propulsion, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity rather than muddying it. A single, minor register drift occurs in the climax with "foundational C-sharp," which momentarily leans technical, but it is a hairline slip that does not harm closure. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or artifacting.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and highly controlled, with rhythmic variation and clear propulsion. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, woven seamlessly into action. A minor instance of potential scaffold exists in "revelation and dread in equal measure," but it is an isolated phrase that does not obscure causality or dull the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion that accelerates with the drumming. A minor instance of potential overwriting ("a silence so complete it reflected the absence of sound back upon itself") is pattern-taught and serves the voice. No loops, scaffolds, or muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is concise, propulsive, and highly dense, with sentences advancing multiple jobs of character, atmosphere, and plot. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A single minor artifact: "layered tranquility" is slightly therapy-speaky but is immediately dramatized and thus not penalized.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("a library of forgotten scents," "clenched fist of stone"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. The final paragraph's rhythm beautifully supports the emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor prose artifact exists: the phrase "passionate subtlety" is used twice, creating a slight template cadence. This does not obscure cause/effect but slightly dulls the specificity of the final image, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without overwriting. Rhythm varies naturally ("gentle tap on leaves," "soft sigh of a ripening pear"). No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("architecture of convincing half truths") is purposeful and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor deductions for a slight tendency toward thesaurus-churn in phrases like "luminescent ache" and "boldly sympathetic," which, while legible, introduce a hint of decorative language in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive, with nearly every sentence serving multiple functions of character, atmosphere, and plot. Figurative language is consistent and masterfully integrated ("sculpting time," "fractured rhythms"). A single, minor instance of adjacent paraphrasing ("a skip in the record of existence" following "interrupted cadence") prevents a perfect score, but clarity is never harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. One minor artifact: "a hollow absence where her brother once stood" uses a slightly common phrasing for loss. However, this is a single instance and does not obscure the closure. The final paragraph is a model of concise, propulsive, and resonant writing.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally clear and concise with high information density, often doing multiple jobs (e.g., "sapphire hush" establishes tone, time, and atmosphere). Rhythm is controlled and varies naturally with the scene's needs. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "kindly methodical" is slightly label-like, but it is immediately dramatized by his actions, preventing a significant deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and clear propulsion. Sentences are concise and advance multiple story elements. Minor artifact: a slight cluster of filter verbs ("she saw," "she worked") in the pivotal metamorphosis paragraph creates a minor drag on immediacy, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, though slightly overwritten in places (e.g., "grinding need: to thresh meaning..."). No loops or scaffolds, but a few mixed metaphors ("kernel of truth... grind into pigment") slightly muddle sense without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language (“silhouette a stark cutout,” “symphony of stone”) is precise and purposeful, advancing atmosphere without muddle. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and advance character, plot, and atmosphere simultaneously. No artifacts, loops, or figurative muddle; the language is precise and evocative throughout, even in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concise imagery. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in phrases like "calcified into purpose" and "cartography of the mystical," which feel slightly elevated for her internal voice. However, these are isolated and do not harm clarity or momentum, especially in the powerful closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.1)

    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the opening paragraph ("gloomy cheerfulness," "melancholic peace," "whisper of closing pages"), which, while beautiful, slightly slows the initial momentum. The final third is flawless, with clear, propulsive sentences that land the closure perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A few minor artifacts exist, such as the slightly cliché "weight like an anchor on her soul" and the near-paraphrase between "hopeful desperation" and "steady resolve," preventing a higher score.

    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the opening paragraph ("hollow roar," "chorus of life"), which, while voice-motivated, creates a small momentum drag before the narrative engine fully engages.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the climax ("The immense space between him and the voice collapsed into nothing"), which briefly abstracts a peak beat, though the effect is still legible and the final line recovers concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deduction for slight figurative density in peak beats (e.g., "rivers of time, islands in the flow"), though it remains coherent and voice-motivated. No loops, scaffolding, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, accelerating with her urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and vivid with high information economy ("breath pluming in the thin, frigid air"). A minor register drift occurs in the apprentice's dialogue ("aura... yearns"), leaning slightly therapeutic, but it is brief and does not muddy the crucial closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control ("luminous absence," "palpable, waiting quiet"). One minor figurative strain: "energy filling the space" slightly abstracts Kael's entrance. Otherwise, sentences advance multiple jobs (character, atmosphere, plot) without scaffolding. Read-aloud test passes with varied syntax and paragraph lengths. No loops or template cadences.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("a searing brand across her mind") slightly dulls immediacy but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is generally coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor instance of repetitive phrasing occurs ("winnow" appears twice in close succession in the third paragraph), creating a slight scaffold artifact. However, this does not obscure causality or dull the closure, and the sentence-level propulsion is otherwise flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "a forged hush lay heavy").

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure ("a final, perfect stitch in the quilt"). There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere with concision and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously without a single loop, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The description of the cave's light as an "impossible ethereal blue" is a prime example of textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and economical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("silence... was a physical presence"). A minor artifact exists in the slightly convenient phrasing of the cork striking "the rotating mechanism," but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, enhancing rather than obscuring sense in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally and supports the scene's needs. The final line resolves by recharging earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly efficient and propulsive, with excellent information density. Read-aloud rhythm is strong. A minor artifact: the phrase "involuntarily truthful" is repeated in close succession in the first third, creating a slight echo. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. There is no scaffold or looped phrasing. A single minor deduction for a slightly precious phrase ("witnessed isolation") that briefly nudges register, but it does not harm clarity or momentum.

No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle detract from the closure's clarity and power.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains propulsion, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "a river of liquid light pouring into the spiral’s origin point"). A minor register drift occurs with "palette of resolve," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon in a peak beat. Otherwise, rhythm is controlled, and there are no loops or scaffolding artifacts that harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.7)
    Prose exhibits exceptional density and rhythmic control, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("The jealousy curdled into a profound pity"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

The final line resolves with a powerful image that recharges earlier motifs without summarization.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though it approaches overwriting in the climax ("shower of invisible, effervescent dust"). Rhythm is controlled and purposeful. One minor paraphrase loop exists ("It was her scar, but it was no longer a scar."), but it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and concise, with excellent rhythmic control and sensory specificity. Information density is high, with sentences performing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. A minor deduction for a potential paraphrase loop between "spectral, woven into the very air" and "stagnant emotional energy," which slightly dulls the immediacy of a key explanatory beat.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and varied rhythm. There is a minor instance of potential overwriting in the peak beat ("wanderingly exact precision" feels slightly redundant).

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor artifact exists in the phrase "the story changes," which slightly echoes the prompt language. However, this is a single instance and does not create a loop or obscure closure, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("a map of nothing but whispers and echoes," "a quiet blaze of understanding"). Sentence-level rhythm varies effectively. A single minor instance of potential scaffold exists ("a map of nothing but whispers and echoes" and "a final, mocking gift" feel slightly adjacent in concept), but it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally precise and evocative, with strong rhythmic control. Minor scaffold is present in the opening line "a study in patterns, a search for meaning in the cosmic noise, a motivation..." which uses a repetitive structure. This is a small artifact that does not significantly harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language ("a vast, dark mirror," "language of light and shadow") is purposeful and pattern-taught, reflecting the POV. Sentences vary in rhythm to match the peace and subsequent violence of the scene. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences like "Her fingers, blackened with soot, moving with a volcanic tenderness" do multiple jobs. A single, minor artifactor is the phrase "vandalized self-portrait," which, while powerful, risks leaning toward thematic echo, though it is quickly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor deduction is applied for figurative density in the peak beat ("auroral sorrow," "universe exhaled"), which slightly risks ornamentation over clarity. The sentence-level propulsion is excellent, and the closure image is clear and resonant, unaffected by this minor flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly efficient and propulsive, with excellent rhythm and clarity. Information density is high. One minor artifact: the phrase "rust-bronze" in the opening line is slightly redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propelled by vivid, concrete imagery. The line "the shavings collecting like pale tears" is a standout, though the subsequent "bone-dry petals and pale wood" slightly echoes the earlier metaphor, a minor repetition. Rhythm and syntax are expertly controlled to serve the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose has high information density and rhythmic control ("a fragile quiet of held breath and suspended wings"). No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves pressure (e.g., "quartz becoming soft as mist"). Minor register elevation in peak beats but voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely lucid and propulsive with vivid imagery. A minor density issue appears in the climax ("The mystery she inherited... became tangible"), where figurative language stacks slightly, abstracting the beat. This is a small artifact that does not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("atoms of nostalgia" feels slightly abstract) and a mixed metaphor ("shards of glass in her mind" following "emotional residue"). However, the language is purposeful and propels the narrative toward its powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("sorrowful glow, like that of a dying star") is precise and enhances clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously ("the hushed thunder of a thousand past audiences"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph's cadence masterfully supports the resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful. A minor instance of potential abstraction ("a terrifying joy that held the weight of infinite time") in a peak beat is hairline and does not obscure the closure's cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the archive-connection beat ("hurricane of might-bes"), though it remains coherent and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere without scaffold or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense, poetic, and highly efficient, with virtually no scaffolding or loops. Sentences like "a perfume of graceful collapse" do multiple jobs, advancing atmosphere and theme. A minor repetition of "graceful collapse" is the only near-flaw, but it is pattern-taught and purposeful, not an artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete diction. Information density is excellent, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "a monument to the paths closed off"). A minor register drift occurs in the phrase "slow, irrevocable thefts," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon at the climax, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor artifact: the phrase "thunderous serenity" is used twice, which feels slightly repetitive. Otherwise, sentences are concise and propel the story forward. Figurative language is consistent and effective, supporting the tone without muddying clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and efficient, with excellent information density. The read-aloud rhythm is strong, though a slight template cadence appears in a few consecutive sentences starting with "She" during the decoding beat. This is a minor artifact that does not obscure closure clarity but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong information density and purposeful sensory detail. A minor deduction for a slight rhythmic stumble in the list "heat and the dust and the screaming" which slightly softens the peak of the flashback. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exemplary, with no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. However, minor overwriting appears in phrases like "a luminescent ache, a soft, sorrowful glow that illuminated nothing but the depth of the emptiness," which slightly stacks modifiers. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure clarity or cause momentum loss, but prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. A minor artifact exists: a potential filter-verb stack in "Elara watched, her breath still in her lungs" slightly dulls immediacy at a high-pressure moment. This prevents a 9+ score but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and vivid, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("truth was a live wire"). Sentence-level rhythm and syntax expertly control pacing and tension, particularly in the climax and denouement.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and concise, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight repetitive stem: "senselessly perceptive dread" and "entirely perceptive and yet utterly senseless" create a near-paraphrase loop across paragraphs. However, this does not obscure closure clarity, and the overall line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.8)
    Exemplary line-level craft. High information density with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and enhances clarity ("a vibration hanging in the air like a teardrop").

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor density issues appear in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "a personal solar system of regrets" slightly slows momentum). However, information density is high, and the final paragraphs accelerate with clear propulsion toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and virtually flawless. Sentences are propulsive and multi-tasking ("The sound stretched, thinned, and was siphoned into the tiny golden tomb").

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deduct for slight figurative density in the opening paragraph ("ghosts of a hundred rainbows," "lilac unease," "sugar in rain") which, while beautiful, borders on ornamental in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor instance of potential register drift occurs with "retrocognitively trapped," a term that feels slightly technical for the otherwise poetic voice. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure clarity. The sentence-level propulsion is strong, and the final line is a masterful image that recharges prior motifs without a hint of scaffolding or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language ("cascade of silver and blue threads") enhances clarity and momentum, especially in peak beats.

    Prose is dense and lyrical without becoming muddy; figurative language ("willowglass hope") is purposeful and legible. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, with variation in rhythm supporting the accumulative mode. A minor register drift occurs with "telepathy pill recall," which feels slightly academic for the POV, but it is a isolated moment.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally clear and concise with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("a perfect map of sorrow in the air") is precise and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, precise, and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. There is a single, minor artifact: the phrase "as the truth unravels" is used twice, creating a slight paraphrase loop. However, this does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for a few filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") and a slight cliché ("heart a drum"). However, information density is high, and momentum is maintained through to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with vivid imagery ("needle dipping like a tiny oar") that advances atmosphere and character. No loops or artifacts; syntax varies naturally with the scene's rhythm. Read-aloud clarity is high.

There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in a few spots (e.g., "the water was a sheet of black glass shattered...") which, while beautiful, momentarily risks density over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is exceptional. Sentences are dense and purposeful, advancing character and atmosphere simultaneously. The rhythm is varied and propulsive, with no scaffolding, loops, or figurative muddle. The high-tide climax is rendered with stunning clarity and sensory impact.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density.

No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously ("a work of ethereal grit"). A minor instance of scaffold phrasing ("a collective, unconscious sigh seemed to pass through the town") prevents a 9.0+ score, but overall, the line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly propulsive, with near-zero scaffold or loop artifacts. Minor overwriting in a few phrases ("a frantic bird in a stone cage," "architectural perfection, and thus, a perfect prison") slightly inflates texture without advancing sense, preventing a perfect score. The closure beat, however, is flawlessly executed.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and advance character and atmosphere simultaneously ("The violence had been a sudden, passionate act...").

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and vivid, specific diction. A minor instance of near-synonym churn ("spongey dread" used twice) and a slightly elevated phrase ("nervously confident energy") prevent a higher score, but these are hairline slips that do not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the peak beat ("a statue of sound and light" feels slightly decorative). However, the sentence-level propulsion is excellent, and the closure paragraph is flawlessly executed.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. A single minor artifact exists ("peeling paint and shattered dreams" is a mild cliché), but it does not obscure causality or dull the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere without padding.

Sentences are propulsive and dense, advancing story and character without loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is lush and highly dense, with superb rhythmic variation. A minor repetition of "small" in a peak beat ("a small agony... a small ecstasy") is a hairline slip that slightly dulls immediacy, preventing a perfect score. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose exhibits high density and rhythmic control without artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful ("roots like petrified veins"). Sentences advance multiple layers (character, atmosphere, plot). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Closure image is clear and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and vivid, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language ("echo valley longing") is potent and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor issues include a slightly cliché phrase ("electric tang") and a potential filter verb ("he sees") in a peak beat. However, these do not measurably obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image, and the sentence-level propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor overwriting risk in peak beats ("a violent act made serene") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts; sentence-level craft is masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and clarity, though a minor scaffold phrase ("profound, dead silence") appears early. Information density is excellent—lines like "a monument to abandoned hope" do multiple jobs. No figurative muddle in peak beats; the closure image is clean and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor deduction for slight figurative density in phrases like "turbulent and poisoned" which, while effective, edge toward pattern in high-pressure beats. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. One minor artifact: "mulberry ache" risks decorative abstraction but is quickly anchored in "fruited sorrow." No loops or scaffold; figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure ("seed on the wind").

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor instance of potential overwriting in "a skyborne grotto whose crystalline mouth opened to the endless heavens," but the figurative language is coherent and serves the atmosphere. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure cause and effect or the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight register elevation in the journal's prose ("We do not own the land...") which, while thematically crucial, feels a fraction less embodied than Elara's own voice. Otherwise, the prose is taut and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic variation. No loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Figurative language ("a masterpiece of sincerely insincere courtesy") is character-specific and enhances clarity. The final paragraph's cadence shift into a quieter resolution is effectively handled.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor deduction for the slightly overused "sycamore hush" which creates a faint template cadence. Information density is excellent, with lines like "a life moving toward its essential, most impactful state" doing multiple jobs of character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is elegant and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and variation. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple jobs, such as "a tiny, sharp testament to a world of conflict."

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward overwriting in the peak beat ("a silent, roaring concert of light"), which creates a minor figurative muddle, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor deduction for a slight register drift in "stellar doubt" and "wavelength align," which feel slightly academic for the POV's internal voice, though they are conceptually apt. No loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, e.g., "a tiny, complex gem forming from the concentrated essence." No loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("purpose had long since curdled") is consistent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and information density. The description of the dew dripping ("soft *plink*") and the final note spinning from "light and longing" are exemplary. A single instance of potential telling ("earnestly naive") prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished, with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. A minor deduction for the slightly ornamental repetition of "mirrored hush" and a single instance of potential filter phrasing ("He understood his task...").

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally concise and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A single, minor artifact exists: the phrase "symphony of a life lived" leans slightly decorative in an otherwise perfectly calibrated peak beat, but it does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive with high information density. Sentence-level rhythm varies effectively to match scene needs. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. No significant loops, scaffold, or artifacting that obscures causality or dulls the closure image. A single instance of potential synonym churn ("cerebral quiet") is minor and not pervasive.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though the phrase "macerate" creates a slight register drift in an otherwise flawless peak beat. Rhythm and syntax are masterfully controlled to accelerate and breathe with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and clarity. Information density is excellent, with sentences advancing multiple elements. A hairline slip: the phrase "dimensionally homesick" risks therapy-speak abstraction, though it is quickly anchored in concrete sensation ("profound ache").

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the opening paragraph ("a hopeless alchemist whose crucible had never once produced the transformation she sought" could be tighter), but this is a hairline slip that does not touch the powerful, lucid prose of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor artifacts prevent a 9+ score: a slight repetition of "serenely electric" and the phrase "fantasy practicality" feels slightly summary-like. However, these do not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clean and purposeful with strong sensory detail ("salty spray," "cold, empty hourglass"). A minor deduction for a slight scaffold moment in the climax: "His positive nature, now tested to its limit, was his only compass" summarizes a state that could be more deeply dramatized, creating a small momentum dip in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor prose artifact exists—a slight paraphrase loop in "This was not failure. This was data."—which slightly dulls the peak beat. However, clarity and momentum are otherwise flawless, with no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is polished with high information density and rhythmic variety. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously—e.g., "cold iron in one hand, ghostly light on her face." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Closure image is clear and resonant, undulled by artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and concise, with excellent rhythmic control. Sentences accelerate and breathe with the scene's needs. A minor prose artifact occurs in the high-pressure closure beat: a filter-verb stack ("She felt a momentary, impossible cold") slightly dulls the immediacy of the transition experience. This is a hairline slip that touches the closure, preventing a higher score, but the overall density and propulsion are exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.6)
    Line-level craft is exceptional. Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive, with every sentence advancing character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and brilliantly integrated ("a binary star in a nebulous galaxy").

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "sound that seeped into the bones") and a single potential paraphrase loop ("reawaken beauty" / "beauty had been reawakened"). Overall, clarity and propulsion are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.3)
    Line-level craft is exceptional. Sentences are dense and propel the narrative forward without a single wasted word. There is no evidence of loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent, coherent, and deeply integrated with voice and theme. A single minor register drift ("a beautiful shell from which the living creature had fled") slightly abstracts a high-pressure beat, but it is a hairline slip that does not harm closure. Sentence-level rhythm and syntax are masterfully controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("a wall of swirling, dark anxiety," "a symphony, a theory, a poem, a revolution—all at once"). Rhythm is varied and supports the narrative's cadence. No artifacts, loops, or scaffold obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density (e.g., the fairy ring description does triple duty: setting, clue, symbol). No loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("distorted jewel," "cathedral of greenish light") is consistent and enhances clarity. Sentence rhythm varies effectively with depth and discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control ("a time of poignant stillness she had always loved, now another marker of solitude"). Minor deductions for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "whetstone on soft metal," "flickering afterimage") which, while beautiful, creates a density that briefly slows momentum. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor scaffold exists in adjacent sentences describing the seed ("warm and humming") but does not obscure closure. No loops or artifacts in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "the aggregate of countless whispered prayers"). A minor register drift occurs in the phrase "interpreted but undisturbed," which feels slightly more diagnostic than the surrounding embodied prose, preventing a 9.0+ score. Otherwise, clarity and momentum are superb.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density (e.g., "sophisticated melancholy" encapsulates backstory and tone). Figurative language is purposeful and consistent ("voice, dry and calm as archived parchment"). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong rhythmic control and sensory specificity. However, there is minor overwriting in peak beats: "tinkersong wonder" and "deafening instant" slightly dilute the intensity with decorative phrasing. No loops or scaffolding issues. The closure image is clear and powerful, though a hairline slip in figurative consistency prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is concise, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language ("a thread of gold in grey cloth") is effective and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or artifacting. Sentence-level rhythm expertly modulates to match the contemplative and revelatory beats.

The read-aloud rhythm is varied and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and efficient, with high information density. However, a minor figurative density artifact appears in the opening sentence ("sun bleed into the jagged horizon") and a slight template cadence exists in the description of the nut ("fossilized and impossibly heavy"). These are minor and do not obscure closure, but they prevent a top-tier score for line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and varied syntax that accelerates toward closure. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("rigid polymer of his grief" → "learn to braid"). No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure cause/effect; the final image lands with clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. However, a minor instance of potential register drift occurs in the peak beat: "a negative image of the truth" leans slightly conceptual against the otherwise embodied action.

    Prose is dense and propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "she was building a bridge for a ghost"). Rhythm is expertly controlled, accelerating with the memory sequences. A minor deduction for a slight template cadence in a high-pressure beat ("It was not a sound, but a sight—or the memory of one."), though it does not obscure closure. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with excellent rhythmic control and information density. A minor figurative repetition occurs with "latent blaze" appearing early and then "blaze" in the final paragraph, creating a slight echo. However, this does not obscure clarity or causality, and the closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a single instance of potentially overripe phrasing ("a humble sculptor, his simple tool in hand") in the closure, which slightly softens the final image but does not obscure it.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density (e.g., "hopeful melancholy" encapsulates complex emotion). Sentence-level rhythm varies effectively with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied syntax and strong verbs ("thrum emanated," "shimmer in the air"). No loops or artifacts; figurative language ("tiny, stubborn sentinel") enhances clarity. Momentum builds seamlessly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. Minor issue: "journalize" is a slightly clinical verb that creates a tiny register drift in an otherwise embodied narrative. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, vivid, and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. No artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Figurative language ("a library of quiet") is pattern-taught and pays off, enhancing clarity and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor artifact occurs in a high-pressure beat: the description of the tree's core pulsing with "a soft, violet light" introduces a slightly elevated, poetic register that feels a fraction removed from Elara's immediate, embodied perception. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a subtle paraphrase loop: "raveling silence" and "unraveling tapestry" appear close together, creating a slight echo. However, this does not obscure clarity or harm the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished, vivid, and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. A very minor instance of potential register drift ("a waking god") feels slightly elevated for the POV but is not pervasive enough to significantly harm clarity or momentum. Information density is high, and the closure image is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control.

    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and vivid, precise imagery ("charcoal-fingered," "auroral sorrow"). Sentences are propulsive and varied, advancing character and atmosphere simultaneously. One minor artifact: the phrase "mnemonic gift" edges toward label-speak, but it is immediately dramatized as a "curse" and embodied in the replaying of "hollow chuckles," mitigating the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. Minor deduct for a paraphrase loop ("contained the chaos" / "condense the sprawling terror") and slightly elevated diction in peak beats ("contained star of anguish").

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is concise, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density. A minor instance of potential telling ("This was how the mystery began") is strategic and does not stall momentum. No significant artifacts or loops are present.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density and a strong read-aloud rhythm. A minor instance of register drift ("lyrical code breaker" feels slightly authorial) and a soft metaphor ("flow of data") prevent a higher score, but clarity and momentum are never compromised.

A slight figurative density appears in the high-pressure beat describing the viaduct ("crystalline pearls"), and the phrase "restrained wildness" creates a minor coherence strain, but clarity is never harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propelled by strong verbs and specific nouns. The sentence-level rhythm effectively supports the emotional pressure of the climax. A minor artifact penalty (-0.3) is applied for a template cadence in the sentence stem "The [adjective] [noun]..." appearing in close succession in the opening lines ("The official title," "The air," "Her goal"). This is a minor, non-closure obscuring flaw that slightly dulls the opening's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information economy and rhythmic control. The description of the heart's operation is a masterclass in specific, kinetic imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush, precise, and highly evocative, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the opening paragraph ("library of silent stories") and a single potentially contradictory metaphor ("prisoner and a guide"). However, these are hairline slips that do not obscure clarity or harm the powerful closure. The final paragraphs are flawless and propel the story to its resonant end.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "a luminous ache filled her" connects emotion, theme, and action).

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic variety. A few minor artifacts prevent a perfect score: the slightly mixed metaphor of "cool fire" and the phrase "zephyr bloom tone" feels slightly over-written and less precise than the surrounding text, though it does not significantly harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "protected vulnerability" describes both the space and their emotional state).

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slightly elevated diction in the peak beat ("fossil of a past hope") which, while voice-motivated, borders on ornamental. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and evocative with strong rhythmic control. Minor deductions for slight density issues; a cluster of figurative language in the climax ("crystalline note," "golden stories," "moon-song") creates a minor muddle, and the final paragraph employs a declarative summary that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Exceptionally high information density and propulsion. One minor template cadence run ("She saw her father... She saw her own life...") and a slight register elevation in "profound dissonance" prevent a 9+ score, but clarity remains untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)

No paraphrase loops or filter stacks bog momentum, and the final image lands cleanly. Density serves atmosphere and progression rather than ornament for its own sake.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and efficient, with images doing double duty (ampoule as storm, pearls as constellation). Occasional high-density metaphor clusters flirt with excess but don’t blur causality or closure. Sentence rhythm varies and propels. Minimal scaffolding and no meaningful loops.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line work is clean, image‑driven, and economical; most sentences do more than one job. There’s occasional purple edging (“dust and infinity,” “soundless sonic boom”) but clarity endures and cadence supports momentum. No scaffold loops or template runs blunt the peak. The final paragraph lands with precise, concrete reprise (dice, hand, sprout).

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and purposeful imagery. Occasional repeated phrases (“methodically hopeful,” “saffron quiet”) feel like motifs rather than crutches. The prose skirts purple but stays coherent and grounded in action and image. No loops or scaffolding dull momentum, and the final line resolves with a clean, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lines carry multiple jobs with clean syntax and strong verbs; images are vivid yet controlled.

No scaffold loops or cadence templates bog the climax. Final line lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lines carry multiple jobs (setting, psychology, stakes) with little scaffold or redundancy; rhythm varies and supports momentum. Figurative language is lush but disciplined, mostly avoiding muddle. A few high‑register phrases skate close to purple but remain voice‑motivated and clear. The final sentence resolves with image and cadence rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lines are musical yet clear; images (“glowed like captured moons,” “spiraling void”) are apt and non‑redundant. Figurative density rises under pressure but remains coherent; minimal scaffolding or loops. Syntax varies with momentum, and verbs do the work. If anything, one or two metaphors could be pared to let the most striking images breathe even more.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences are clean, image‑driven, and purposeful; rhythm varies and supports momentum. Figurative language is apt (“sunwashed dread,” “song of controlled breakage”) without muddle or overgrowth.

    Line‑level craft is concise, with purposeful sensory cues and a good balance of action and thought. The prose avoids clutter and generally advances pressure. A few abstract formulations (especially the final line) slightly soften immediacy. Rhythm and clarity hold throughout without loops or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies with clean propulsion; images often do double duty for mood and action. Occasional purple glints (“hushed blaze,” “interlaced absence”) are controlled and mostly functional. No loops or scaffold; mechanics are clean. A touch more verb‑driven clarity in two metaphor‑dense lines could sharpen peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and image‑dense with strong nouns and verbs (palimpsest, polymer, water‑ceiling). Minor repetition (“reclaimed stillness,” “dappled”) feels intentional rather than padded. Figurative control holds; no template cadence or loops. A hair more concision in a few descriptive clauses could sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in rhythm; information density is high with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is rich but mostly disciplined; repeated motifs earn their keep at closure. No meaningful loops or cadence templates dull momentum. A hint of purple is kept in check by concrete craft and spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line‑level craft is tight: varied rhythm, strong verbs, minimal scaffold, and high information density. Figurative language is frequent but coherent to the motif (perturbation, resonance, conserved potential) and rarely mixes vehicles. A few stacked abstractions flirt with purple but do not obscure action or closure. No noticeable loops or cadence templates dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong, propulsive lines with purposeful image selection and minimal scaffolding. A few purple or generic abstractions in the climax (“universal song,” “everlasting broadcast”) blunt edge and specificity. Otherwise, syntax and momentum are clean, with good verb choice and clarity of sequence. No major loops or cadence templates.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line‑level craft is tight, with images doing multiple jobs and minimal scaffolding.

Syntax supports momentum through the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line‑level craft is strong: clear syntax, high information density, and purposeful imagery (utility poles as “a scar of human order”). Occasional abstractions (“backlash of regrets,” “alignment”) flirt with telling, but they’re supported by concrete beats before and after. No significant loops or template cadences blunt momentum. The closing line recharges the motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is precise and propulsive, with strong nouns/verbs and minimal scaffolding. Repetition (e.g., “jaded wonder”) reads intentional rather than looped. Figurative language (“delicately robust,” “message in a bottle”) is apt and not overstacked. No artifacts or clarity slips impede momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lines carry density and propulsion; images do double duty (spices as both world and method). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; minimal scaffold or paraphrase loops. Occasional stacked modifiers and abstract intensifiers skim the edge of overwriting but do not blur sense or the closure image. Mechanics are clean and sequence is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lines are dense and purposeful, with varied rhythm and minimal scaffold; imagery does more than one job. A few phrases edge toward purple (“choking beauty,” “Milky Way bled its cold light”) but remain coherent and voice‑true. No loops or cadence templates drag momentum. Final images are clear and well‑placed.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences are purposeful and varied, with images doing double duty (gravity as sorrow; stitching as repair and ritual). A few high-register phrases (“frequency of pure, massless peace”) brush purple but don’t blur sense. No scaffold loops or template cadences slow momentum. The final line recharges prior motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line‑level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and minimal scaffolding. Some phrases recur (“vibrant hush,” “slow dance”) but function as motifs rather than loops. The prose skirts purple at times yet stays coherent and purposeful. Syntax supports momentum and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and purposeful; sentences carry multiple jobs (world, character, action) with minimal scaffold. Figurative choices (“infusion of amethyst and gold,” “cradle of sparks”) are apt and not over‑stacked. A slight lushness occasionally edges toward purple but maintains clarity and momentum. No loops or mechanical cadence artifacts noted.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line‑level craft is concise, image‑rich, and purposeful; sentences do more than one job and propel momentum. Figurative language is controlled and consistent with the world’s physics; no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Final image lands cleanly without purple overreach. Minor density patches could breathe more under peak beats, but clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lines are dense and purposeful, with strong verbs and charged images doing multiple jobs. A few metaphor stacks and intensifiers flirt with excess, but clarity and momentum are maintained, especially through action beats around the timer and the release. Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing keep propulsion intact. The final image is crisp and unblurred by purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean, concise lines with purposeful imagery; objects do double duty. Minimal redundancy and smooth sentence rhythm; no figurative muddle at peak beats. Occasional aphoristic statements edge toward summary but don’t stall momentum. The final line returns images with clarity and charge.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs—world, mood, and motion—without scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is vivid and mostly disciplined; motifs return purposefully. A couple of intensifiers (“true anarchy,” “blooming resistance”) tread close to label rather than fresh image, but clarity and propulsion hold. Copy is clean and the final image resolves with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line‑level craft is polished: images work double duty (false F‑sharp as both character and plot device), and modifiers stay purposeful. Minimal scaffolding, strong verbs, and clean sequencing keep momentum. The lyricism approaches lush once or twice but stops short of purple; no pattern artifacts or loops blunt clarity. The final image is crisp and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally tight with high information density and vivid sensory choices. A few phrases lean ornamental or redundant, but momentum rarely stalls. Figurative language remains consistent to the world’s logic. The final image is clean and propulsive without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line‑level craft is precise and musical, with purposeful imagery and minimal scaffolding.

No figurative muddle or loops that dull closure.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, marked by high information density and precise, evocative language. The opening sentence is a model of establishing tone and theme simultaneously. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought metaphors; every sentence works to advance the story's accumulative effect. The rhythm is varied and controlled, moving from clipped observation to more lyrical reflection in step with the protagonist's internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density. Sentences like "her breath pluming in the air, a ghost of her former luminosity" work on multiple levels. There are no significant prose artifacts or loops. The piece is held just shy of the 9-band by a few instances of familiar literary phrasing ("furnace's heart," "bleed over the eastern rim") that are competent but not startlingly fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense with purposeful imagery, demonstrating strong sentence-level propulsion. Word choice is precise and evocative, especially in descriptions of the conservatory and Elara's sensory world. A minor deduction is for a single slightly mixed metaphor ("knitted back together by the light of the note"), a hairline fissure in an otherwise flawless surface that briefly muddles the physical logic of the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong and evocative, but it is weakened by a key instance of telling over showing. The summary of the restoration ("The research was immense, leading him...") is a significant momentum loss, skipping a crucial period of struggle. Additionally, some figurative language ("a soul of light") feels slightly overwrought, momentarily disrupting the otherwise grounded and somber tone.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and often striking, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. There are, however, minor instances of overwriting where the language becomes slightly overwrought, such as "a breath that seemed to draw in all the amplified quiet of the twilight." While the overall quality is very high, a final pass for concision would sharpen the impact of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is clear and grammatically sound, it suffers from a high density of figurative language that approaches overwriting. Phrases like "scent like forgotten promises," "liquid moonlight," and "constellation of tiny, shimmering particles" are layered so thickly they can slow momentum and feel more decorative than propulsive. This lack of restraint is the primary weakness, detracting from the story's otherwise solid craft.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally elegant, precise, and high-density, with strong, memorable phrases ("suffocating grain of old film dissolving"). The rhythm and syntax support the story's movement from meditative exploration to panicked stasis to reality-bending climax. A minor weakness is the final paragraph's tendency toward summary, which reads like scaffolding that should have been removed, slightly dulling the final beat's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clear, evocative, and propulsive. However, it suffers from minor but noticeable repetition of key phrases like "patiently strategic" and "staggering grace." While intended as a motif, the recurrence feels slightly heavy-handed and borders on self-consciousness, particularly in the final paragraph. This stylistic tic is the primary flaw in an otherwise well-crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with not a wasted word. Sentence structure is varied to control rhythm, accelerating into the climax and settling into the final, quiet realization. Figurative language is both original and purposeful, particularly in the description of the captured sound as "a shattering prism of obsidian and ice," which lands with physical force. There are no discernible loops or prose artifacts to disrupt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with high information density. However, the reliance on rich, figurative language is pervasive, and at the story's peak emotional moment, the density of metaphor ("a universe of unspoken history") verges on overwriting. The late introduction of the "jar of captured moonbeams" pushes the boundary of established world rules but is integrated just well enough into the story's fantastical logic to work.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean and often lyrical, with strong imagery ("sculpture of white," "dust motes dancing like atoms"). The rhythm and syntax are varied and support the story's momentum effectively. While a few phrases verge on the familiar ("weighty lightness," "profound and paradoxical peace"), the line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with high information density and no significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean and carries strong images. However, it is weakened by a recurring reliance on template cadence and parallel structures ("He wasn't... He was..."; "The old Leo would have... But the new Leo stood..."). This syntactic repetition, while creating a certain rhythm, feels mechanical and slightly flattens the voice. The story would be stronger if these scaffold-like constructions were revised for greater variety and naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional control, using dense, figurative language not as ornamentation but as the primary tool for world-building and characterization. The syntax varies to control rhythm, mirroring the pauses and flows of the silence being described. There are no wasted words or scaffold; each sentence carries a high density of information about atmosphere, action, and internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly efficient, with high information density in every sentence. Word choice is impeccable, and the rhythm of the language beautifully complements the story's contemplative yet tense atmosphere. There are no wasted words, overwrought metaphors, or clunky sentence structures; the craft is clean, confident, and serves the story at every level. The piece reads as meticulously polished.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, with figurative language that is consistently purposeful. Sentences like "Her breath a ghost in the resonant hush of the wet, empty plaza" are both beautiful and functional. The piece is nearly flawless at the line level, with a minor deduction for the slightly awkward phrasing of the sentence "The realization arrived after words become unnecessary."

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with a varied rhythm that matches the story's meditative yet tense mood. Word choice is precise and evocative, and the final line provides a perfect, satisfying cadence. There is virtually no scaffolding, with the exception of one sentence that explains the premise of the climax, a hairline flaw in a piece of crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its sensory descriptions like "icy warmth." However, a minor but distinct grammatical error in the final paragraph ("a profound and subdued awakenings washed over her") prevents a higher score. For a top-tier publication, this copy-level flaw, while small, would require correction and slightly mars an otherwise impeccable execution.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative figurative language ("a sound that seemed to drink the light"). The momentum is generally excellent, though the repeated phrase "water damage creating images" acts as a minor scaffold. The piece avoids major overwriting, but the high density of adjectives and adverbs occasionally borders on the ornamental, slightly slowing the otherwise propulsive narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and precise. Word choice is consistently strong (e.g., "hollowed out," "baptism of ice," "achingly pure"), and figurative language serves to heighten atmosphere and emotional stakes. There is no evidence of scaffolding or redundancy; every sentence contributes to the story's momentum and texture. The line-level craft is confident and supports the story's literary aspirations without drawing undue attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative. Word choice is precise and powerful ("cathedral of decay," "phantom ballet of labor"). Sentence structure varies to control pace, from long, descriptive sentences building atmosphere to the short, sharp declaratives after the climax ("The sound vanished. The pressure dropped."). There are no technical flaws, loops, or overwriting; every line serves a purpose with grace and force.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery and a deliberate, elegant rhythm. Sentences like "stone wept dust and knowledge dissolved into mud" show high-level craft. The score is held back by minor scaffolding, particularly in the final paragraph, which summarizes the theme rather than allowing the action to carry the full weight of meaning. This verbal summary feels less potent than the concrete image of folding the new swan, creating a slight momentum drag at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. Momentum is well-maintained. A few instances of cliché ("heart soared") or thematic summary in the final paragraph ("She had nurtured his wonder...") slightly reduce the information density and immediacy, preventing a top-tier score for an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and largely concise, with strong verbs and purposeful sentence construction. The final third, however, relies more on abstract conceptual statements to deliver its conclusion, which slightly dulls the immediacy. There's also a minor instance of a paraphrase loop ("why consciousness had retreated... The collective psyche had simply… stopped dreaming"), which softens the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is clean, confident, and highly evocative, with high information density in each sentence. Figurative language, such as the lighthouse beam being a "slow, silent scythe," is memorable and effective without being overwrought. The piece demonstrates excellent rhythmic control and avoids any significant prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding, resulting in a smooth and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and ambitious, with a rich texture and confident rhythm. Word choice is precise and evocative, creating high information density. There are moments where the conceptual language borders on becoming overly dense, such as the direct statement, "The core concept of his existence... was not a natural state but a construct," which verges on telling, but these are minor and do not detract from the overall momentum or clarity of the powerful closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with a high density of evocative imagery that rarely feels overwritten. The rhythm of the sentences effectively mirrors the story's progression from quiet anticipation to a vibrant crescendo and back to stillness. While the conceptual language is ambitious, it remains tethered to the character's perspective. The story is free of technical errors, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious and highly polished, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. There is a tendency toward high figurative density, especially in the opening paragraph, which verges on overwriting and slightly slows momentum. However, the language is precise and avoids significant loops or artifacts, maintaining clarity through its complex subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, but the climax suffers from a minor tendency to explain the emotional effect rather than fully embodying it. Lines like "The deep, thrumming bass was a sorrow" provide a diagnostic label for the sensation, slightly distancing the reader from the raw experience at the story's most critical beat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is clean, concise, and rhythmically controlled, with high information density. However, a few minor authorial intrusions slightly mar its perfection. Phrases like "Elara was credibly curious" and the post-facto summary of her method ("progressing laterally") are small moments of telling rather than showing that momentarily flatten the otherwise immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong, specific imagery ("clenched fist of stone," "ghostly lace"). Momentum is well-paced, building to the climax and settling into the quiet final beat. A few lines, such as "She did not just observe the impact of memories; she was drowning in it," slightly paraphrase the action just shown, creating a minor redundancy that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, with strong imagery. A notable prose artifact is the repetition of the phrase "passionate subtlety," which feels more like a thematic instruction than a natural description. The most significant flaw is the final paragraph, which functions as unnecessary scaffolding, explaining the thematic resolution rather than letting the final action and image resonate on their own, thus dulling the story's propulsive finish.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. Lines like "a flat, ashen whisper" and "a spectral cathedral" demonstrate high-level craft. The score is slightly tempered by the self-conscious repetition of the phrase "magnificent simplicity," a conceptual loop that feels like an authorial label rather than an organic part of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and largely pristine, with high information density and strong momentum. A few minor phrases, such as the slightly clunky "It was as the transformation completes that she understood" and the mild redundancy in "subsume her own defenses completely," represent hairline cracks in an otherwise polished surface. These do not detract from the powerful closure but keep the craft just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, elegant, and propelled by strong verbs and precise imagery. The pacing is controlled, with sentences that mirror the story's emotional rhythm—brisk on the cobblestones, still and lingering in the library. There is a slight tendency towards summarizing emotion in the final line ("Elara left feeling..."), but it's a minor flaw in an otherwise polished and professional piece of writing with no significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often beautiful and evocative, but it occasionally suffers from overwriting, with dense clusters of adjectives and adverbs that slow momentum ("curious, collective desire," "gentle, communal inquiry"). The final paragraph contains a line that reads like a thematic label ("a testament to the grafted self"), which feels less organic than the imagery that precedes it. These moments of telling in an otherwise showing-focused piece slightly dull the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and frequently stunning, with high information density and evocative imagery. However, in a few key moments, it slips into slight overwriting. Phrasing like "horrific, silent interrupted cadence" uses a somewhat generic intensifier ("horrific") that tells rather than shows the feeling, momentarily breaking the otherwise seamless craft. While the line-level execution is overwhelmingly strong, these minor instances of self-conscious ornamentation hold it back from true perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and a complete absence of scaffolding or repetitive phrasing. Sentences are both beautiful and functional, advancing plot and atmosphere simultaneously ("each drop elongating into a shimmering thread"). The prose achieves a rare crystalline clarity that is propulsive and immersive, with every word choice feeling deliberate and impactful. The read-aloud quality is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, concise, and often lyrical, with high information density in every sentence. Word choice is precise and evocative ("ferromagnetic," "burgeoning blue light"). A few moments rely on slightly familiar phrasing ("warmth spreading through his chest"), which are minor blemishes on an otherwise impeccable line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and precise imagery ("a bead of water like a emerald specimen under glass"). Momentum is well-maintained throughout the central conflict. The score is held back slightly by the final paragraphs, which rely on abstract nouns ("sustaining transformation," "resilient, adaptive life") and summarizing statements, reducing the imagistic precision that characterizes the rest of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is consistently polished, evocative, and dense with purpose. Lines like "painted in the bruised hours between midnight and dawn" and "a tiny, captured sun" demonstrate precise, powerful word choice. The rhythm and syntax are controlled throughout, accelerating during the discovery and settling into a contemplative cadence at the close, with no discernible artifacts or overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional control, balancing evocative, figurative language with clarity and concision. Sentences are rhythmically varied and information-dense, propelling the narrative without a single wasted word or overwrought image. There are no notable loops, scaffold, or prose artifacts; the craft is clean and serves the story's atmospheric and thematic aims with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with many strong images. However, the density of the required keyword elements in the opening paragraphs feels slightly mechanical, creating a faint sense of a checklist being addressed. Phrases like "navigated absences," "reactively visionary," and "staggered intervals" appear in quick succession, creating a minor prose artifact that slightly disrupts the otherwise organic flow of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong rhythm and sentence variety. However, a few phrases slightly diminish the momentum with summary, such as "The unraveling mysteries of a lifetime were waiting..." which tells the reader the stakes rather than letting the image do the work. While generally excellent, these minor instances of scaffolding prevent a higher score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely excellent, with a strong rhythmic flow. However, a few moments rely on summary over dramatization, such as "The memories coalesced into a painful truth." While efficient, these instances slightly flatten the immediacy of Elara's discovery. The line-level craft is otherwise very strong, avoiding cliché and maintaining momentum, but these minor scaffolds prevent a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with no wasted words or scaffold-like phrasing. Figurative language like "hushed thunder" and "spatial mutiny" is both original and precise. The sentences have a varied, compelling rhythm that propels the narrative forward, and the final paragraph lands the conceptual shift with clarity and force.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. The rhythm and word choice are excellent, particularly in the opening. The score is held back slightly by a few instances of conceptual paraphrase, where a beat of insight is followed by a sentence that restates it too directly, such as the explanation of the ink's function.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, controlled, and demonstrates high information density, with sentences often advancing character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. Word choice is precise and evocative ("gilded-leaf," "visual topography"). A slight deduction is warranted for a few phrases like "incandescent restraint" or "prism of moments" that verge on being self-consciously literary, momentarily pulling away from the otherwise grounded sensory experience. However, these are minor and do not disrupt the momentum or clarity of the powerful closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific sensory details. Sentences are well-constructed and propel the narrative forward with a deliberate pace. The piece avoids major artifacts, but a few phrases like "a cold stone in K’s chest" lean on familiar formulations, preventing the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of flawless originality.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and rhythmic, with potent figurative language ("skeleton against the bruised twilight sky"). A minor weakness is a recurring reliance on abstract conceptual nouns in key moments ("universal riddle decoded itself"). More embodied, sensory language at the peak of the epiphany could have grounded the intellectual insight with greater visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Figurative language, like the "anchor on her soul" or Hem's sigh "like creaking wood," is fresh and perfectly integrated. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or momentum. The line-level craft is a significant strength, creating a polished and immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, clear, and propulsive, with high information density and a strong sense of rhythm. Figurative language, such as the craters as "silver thumbprints" and the "diamond-hard stars," is vivid and purposeful. A few stock phrases ("hours bled into one another," "impossibly out of place") are the only minor flaws in an otherwise exemplary line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally well-paced, with strong imagery like the "cold iron belly of the city." However, a few moments rely on abstract labels for emotion ("A magnetic calm settled over her") rather than embodied description, slightly flattening the narrative texture. While free of significant artifacts, the line-level craft could achieve greater immediacy by grounding these states in more concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and evocative imagery ("shadow a fleeting bruise," "a gaunt silhouette"). The rhythm and syntax support the story's atmospheric build. The score is held just below the highest tier by a few sentences near the end that lean into summary and slight redundancy, such as "Elara’s quest was over, but her purpose was just beginning," which momentarily dulls the otherwise sharp momentum leading into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery ("a question... its answer," "a note placed back on the staff"). The sentence and paragraph structure vary to create a compelling rhythm. A few phrases verge on the familiar ("blanket of wildflowers," "bled purple into the sky"), which slightly tempers the otherwise excellent and distinctive line-level craft, keeping it just shy of a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density. However, a few phrases like "screaming static of a fractured mind" and "siren song" are familiar clichés that momentarily soften the otherwise sharp prose. The concept of an "emotional counter-frequency" feels slightly more told than shown, a small abstraction in a very concrete story.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with high information density in most lines. There are, however, a few moments of slight overwriting where abstraction dulls the immediacy, such as "a quiet that sustains impossibilities" and "a tangible piece of secrecy itself." These are minor but noticeable in an otherwise immaculate piece, slightly pulling back from flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with many striking phrases like "winter-cracked fields" and "crystalline equations." However, a few moments rely on stock phrasing ("deep pools of sorrow") or dip into summary ("He understood now"), which slightly dilutes the immediacy of the climax. These are minor but notable blemishes on an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong rhythm and clarity. Its primary weakness is a tendency towards poetic but abstract conceptual phrases ("orchid solace," "resilient spirit of salt-grass") where more concrete, sensory details would provide a stronger anchor, particularly during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean and often beautiful, with strong verbs and clear imagery. However, there is a recurring tendency to rely on abstract emotional descriptors ("quietly desperate heart," "resolve was iron") and a few minor instances of paraphrase loops ("interrupted, cut short"). These moments, while infrequent, slightly soften the prose's momentum and information density, preventing it from achieving flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally strong, with a varied rhythm and vivid imagery, particularly in the opening. There are minor instances of overwriting ("ghost-whispers... phantom clatter") and telling ("a carefully inventive figure"). Some phrasing feels overly polished for the moment, but the core mechanics of the writing are clear and propulsive without significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative from the opening line. Sentences are well-constructed with a strong sense of rhythm, and word choice is precise. There is a notable absence of scaffolding or repetitive phrasing. The momentum is maintained flawlessly until the final paragraph, which feels slightly compressed in its summary of the coup's failure, but this is a minor issue in an otherwise impeccable execution.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("tangled roots like a cage built by a mad god"). However, there are occasional lapses into overwriting where the language becomes more declarative than evocative, such as describing the spirits' song as speaking "of love so strong it had outlasted death itself." These moments are infrequent and do not disrupt the momentum or clarity of the pivotal climax, which is handled with commendable restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lyrical and precise for the most part, but a noticeable paraphrase loop ("a chaotic script... a child’s desperate attempt" followed by "The notes were a cipher of panic, etched in the desperate handwriting...") slows momentum by restating the same information. This prose artifact prevents a higher score in an otherwise strong category.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose contains striking images, particularly in its description of the setting and the light installation. Momentum is slightly undercut by a recurring template cadence ("This was more than a memory...", "This was her medium...", "This was her display...") that feels like authorial scaffolding rather than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong, evocative imagery like a note hanging "like a liquid jewel." However, a few minor phrases slightly dull the momentum. The line "With a newfound conviction" is a moment of telling in a story that otherwise excels at showing. Similarly, the explicit labeling of "the first awakening" and "the second awakening" feels a touch mechanical, slightly interrupting the otherwise seamless flow of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("a humid jungle of chirps and clicks," "a glorious, untraceable cacophony of growth"). The rhythm and sentence structure support the story's momentum effectively. The final paragraph contains a few phrases that lean more towards thematic summary than pure imagistic resonance, a minor indulgence in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional line-level craft, with a rich vocabulary and varied sentence rhythms that support the story’s poetic aims. While the language is consistently dense and figurative, it maintains clarity and avoids becoming opaque, a difficult balance to strike. The writing is free of loops or scaffolding, showing a high degree of polish and control.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly efficient, with lines that are both beautiful and functional. Figurative language, such as the "foxglove regret," is specific and deepens characterization without ever feeling overwritten. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the sentences flow with a controlled momentum that builds to a luminous conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, with strong imagery like the ink being a "droplet of captured galaxy." However, during the peak emotional beats, the language occasionally drifts into abstract or overwrought phrasing ("soaring, intricate composition of clarity and compassion," "foundational resonance"). This tendency slightly undermines the grounded, tactile nature of the translation process, creating a minor muddle of figurative density where sharp clarity is most needed.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong, clear, and propulsive, with memorable images like “the breath catching in the volcano’s throat.” The rhythm and syntax effectively support the story's tension and release. The score is held back by minor but noticeable instances of overwriting, such as the slightly awkward "slyly heartfelt efficiency" and a tendency towards stacked descriptors in moments of high emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Sentences like, “She found her equilibrium not by looking at the sky, but by mapping the swirl of dust motes under a single skylight,” are both beautiful and functional. The rhythm and syntax shift appropriately with the story's momentum, moving from meditative to tense, and the entire piece is free of scaffolding or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. The story avoids major line-level artifacts like loops or scaffolding until the final paragraph. The concluding sentences, which explain the theme, read more like an analytical summary than narrative prose, sacrificing momentum and emotional impact for explicit clarification at the story's most crucial beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and a strong, evocative rhythm. Sentences like "The water beyond was a dome of absolute black, a negative image of the night sky" are vivid and efficient. The score is slightly tempered by the jarring inclusion of the foreign word "缝合" mid-sentence, which reads as an uncorrected artifact and momentarily breaks the immersive flow.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant and efficient, marked by high information density and evocative imagery without becoming overwritten. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied effectively, particularly in the climactic parallel phrasing ("She saw the storm... She saw the captain..."). The piece is exceptionally clean, with no discernible loops or scaffolding, allowing the story's inherent poetry to shine through.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. However, it is weakened by several instances of scaffold-like sentences that explain the story's mechanics or theme directly ("This was his method..."). The final sentence is a prime example of a prose artifact that summarizes the theme rather than letting the final image resonate on its own, which dulls the closure's impact and prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is flawless. The prose achieves a rare combination of high figurative density and crystalline clarity, with each sentence advancing the story’s emotional and thematic weight. Word choice is precise and evocative (e.g., “cabochon,” “epidermis,” “lexicon”), and the rhythm of the sentences supports the story’s solemn, ritualistic momentum without a single misstep or clichéd phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density. However, there is a tendency towards overwriting in certain phrases ("noctilucent reckonings," "ephemeral scripture"), which, while beautiful, can feel overly ornate. More critically, the final two paragraphs contain sentences that paraphrase and explain the thematic insight that the final image already conveys, creating a minor redundancy that slightly dulls the closure's sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative, with a strong rhythm and high information density. Sentences like "She was a woman built of hard angles and tougher resolve" establish character and tone immediately. A minor deduction is warranted for the slightly self-conscious repetition of the verb "enlighten," which feels more like a thematic label than a precise description of the action, creating a small moment of register drift in an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is consistently elegant and dense with striking imagery. While the figurative language is generally a strength, there are moments where the density is almost too uniform, risking overwriting. For instance, explaining "a serene upheaval... not a panic, but a profound and calm acceptance" feels like a slight scaffold, telling us how to interpret a powerful phrase. However, the line-level craft remains very high, with strong rhythm and momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery. However, there are occasional moments of telling where showing would be more powerful (e.g., the "legacy's burden settled onto her shoulders"). The final sentence feels slightly less sharp than the rest of the piece, summarizing the new state rather than leaving it resonant in the final image alone. These are minor issues in an otherwise strong performance.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and frequently stunning, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. There are, however, minor recurring artifacts that prevent a perfect score. The repetition of key phrases like "perceptively calm" and "dusky harmony" in the final paragraph feels slightly heavy-handed, functioning more as a label or thematic summary than as seamless prose.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, lyrical, and demonstrates high-level craft, with powerful, concise imagery ("lattice of truce written in starfire"). There are no technical errors or momentum-dulling loops. However, a few key emotional descriptions lean on abstraction ("a compound interest of grief...") rather than embodied detail, a minor but notable instance of telling over showing that slightly mutes the impact of peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and confident, marked by striking and original imagery ("cracked and infinite porcelain plate," "bruised sky"). Sentence structure is varied and propulsive, carrying the narrative forward with a grace that matches the story's tone. While the language is highly stylized, it remains clear and purposeful, avoiding overwriting and serving character and atmosphere without a single wasted word.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and confident, with high information density and strong sentence-level propulsion. However, the sheer density of figurative language ("a testament to a warmth the world tried to extinguish," "a revolution contained within the alarming serenity") occasionally risks tipping into overwriting. This density, while generally effective, slightly dulls the immediacy of key moments with its performative beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional: precise, evocative, and dense with meaning. The language is elevated without feeling overwrought, and figurative language is consistently strong and purposeful ("city’s lights glittering like a fallen constellation"). There are no prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to momentum and atmosphere. The read-aloud quality is superb.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by a strong internal rhythm. Word choice is precise and evocative, establishing a potent atmosphere from the first sentence. The story is free of overwriting, scaffolding, or repetitive phrasing; every sentence serves a purpose. The figurative language ("blushing stillness," "a living note in a silent song") is controlled and effective, contributing to a cohesive and powerful aesthetic without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery ("breath pluming," "river of liquid sun"). Momentum is well-maintained through varied sentence structures that mirror the deliberate pace of Elara's work. The only minor friction is the repetition of the phrase "technically gentle," which stands out as a slight tic in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is remarkably clean, dense, and purposeful, with nearly every sentence contributing to character, plot, or atmosphere. Figurative language, such as the directive being "a ghost in her own machine," is potent and well-integrated. The final paragraphs, in particular, demonstrate masterful control of rhythm and pacing, carrying the reader through the protagonist's dissolution into a state of profound peace.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and controlled, with a rhythm that supports the story's solemn, thoughtful tone. Word choice is excellent, information density is high, and there are no discernible prose artifacts or loops. The framing of the narrative with the phrase "dusky harmony" is a particularly masterful touch, providing a resonant sense of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, but it leans heavily on abstract concepts ("traps of consequence," "state of potential," "shifting grace") at the expense of concrete, sensory detail. There is a paraphrase loop in the opening paragraph describing Elara's motivations. While the rhythm is controlled, the over-reliance on conceptual language slightly dulls the story's immediacy and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, dense, and demonstrates exceptional line-level craft with no discernible artifacts like loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is inventive and supports the atmosphere without becoming overwrought. While the style is consistently elevated, it remains clear and propulsive, carrying the reader through the mystical sequence with grace.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The rhythm is well-paced, moving from the sharp shock of the opening to the meditative actions in the cathedral. A few phrases lean slightly towards familiar poetic constructions ("coiled like a pale serpent," "flag of surrender...beacon for a new one"), which are minor blemishes on an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density, with lines like "a perfect symbol of nonlinear inheritance where the past offered not answers, but deeper voids." There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; the rhythm is controlled and purposeful, accelerating during moments of panic and quieting in the moment of decision. The word choice is precise and evocative throughout, supporting the story's tone and conceptual depth without fault.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a few moments rely on slightly overwrought metaphors ("a stitch in a tapestry of personal fault lines") or abstract, diagnostic language ("methodically researching these gaps in her own character"). These instances, while infrequent, momentarily pull back from the scene's immediacy and slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with high information density and striking imagery. There are no technical flaws, loops, or scaffold phrases. The score is tempered only by the sustained intensity of the figurative language; the unrelenting density, while beautiful, creates a uniform texture that could benefit from moments of plainer syntax to vary the rhythm and allow key images to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, elegant, and precise, with strong verbs and evocative sensory details ("dust-moted silence," "grinding gong"). However, a few minor slips prevent a higher score. The line "a lock without an obvious key" is a touch cliché, and the final paragraph leans slightly toward summarizing the thematic resolution ("The confusion had been translated") rather than letting the final image carry the full weight. These are minor flaws in otherwise polished and effective prose.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise for most of the story, with high information density and evocative imagery. A minor weakness appears in the penultimate paragraph, which contains slight paraphrase loops that summarize the emotional and sensory shift ("The hammered repose...melted away," "The frantic hum was gone, replaced by..."). This momentarily tells what was just shown, briefly slowing momentum before the final thematic insight.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is evocative and dense with purposeful imagery. The piece avoids major artifacts, but a few minor paraphrase loops slightly dull the momentum, such as the two sentences explaining her motivation in the first paragraph. While largely clean, these small instances of redundancy prevent the prose from achieving flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. However, the critical moment of climax relies on summary. Lines like "The conjunction... was a catalyst" and "she understood" explain the turn rather than dramatizing the internal process fully. This strategic telling slightly flattens the peak emotional beat, preventing the prose from achieving flawless execution at the story's most crucial point.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, concise, and highly evocative, demonstrating high information density in nearly every line. The final paragraph is particularly strong, using precise language like the "soft, profound *thump*" to create a unique sensory experience. While a few images are familiar, the overall craft is clean, propulsive, and free of any significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, marked by strong verbs and specific, sensory imagery ("the slow creep of barnacles," "smelled of deep water and wet quartz"). The rhythm is well-controlled, slowing in the grotto to build suspense and awe. There are minor imperfections that keep it from the highest tier, such as the slightly cliché "awe that mirrored her own" and the touch of summary in the final paragraph, but these are small flaws in an otherwise polished and propulsive piece.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often demonstrates high information density, particularly in the setup. There are minor instances of overwriting with stacked descriptors during the climax ("impossibly vibrant," "palpably life"). The primary flaw is the tendency to summarize and label in the resolution, such as "She wrote of the silence of inversion, a buoyant hush that cradled her," which restates what the reader just experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often demonstrates high information density, with phrases like "vaulting hush" doing significant work. The rhythm is well-paced and supports the tranquil mood. The primary weakness is a few instances of conceptual redundancy and over-articulation, such as "She was teaching the silence, and in turn, teaching him how to be taught by it," which creates a minor narrative loop that could be more concise.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. There are, however, minor instances of cliché ("the air crackled with potential") and scaffolding language that echo the prompt, particularly in the final paragraph. While the overall quality is very high, these moments of slightly less polished phrasing prevent it from achieving true flawlessness, particularly the direct reuse of "wisely adventurous" and "futuristic nostalgia" at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly evocative for the most part. Lines like "she burns bridges carefully, with the precision of a surgeon, not the rage of an arsonist" are superb. There are, however, a few instances of abstract phrasing ("loaded emptiness," "imperative of the absolute") that feel slightly less grounded than the story's strongest concrete imagery. While minor, these moments momentarily soften the otherwise sharp and specific line-level craft, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often lyrical and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there are minor but noticeable instances of telling over showing, such as the direct statement of her motivation, which could have been left implicit. The final paragraph also contains some summary ("She had not sought riches, but she had found a deeper truth") that feels less potent than the concrete imagery that precedes it, slightly slowing the momentum at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, a few moments detract from its overall excellence, such as the use of the cliché "gilded cage." The most significant flaw is a paraphrase loop in the penultimate paragraph ("She had come seeking a secret... She had mused over ledgers..."), which summarizes the same realization twice, momentarily stalling the story's forward momentum just before its conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is ambitious, elegant, and highly effective at establishing the story's unique atmosphere. Word choice is precise and evocative. However, the style's relentless richness occasionally tips toward overwriting, with dense clusters of adjectives and abstract nouns ("perpetual, factually mystical dew," "terrifying and ecstatic rush of pure potential"). While mostly successful, a slightly more restrained hand in key moments could have heightened the impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density. However, there is a slight tendency toward ornate phrasing ("fractured mosaic," "topography of neglect") that occasionally borders on overwriting. The primary flaw is the final paragraph, which contains some paraphrasing loops that restate the theme already demonstrated, slightly slowing the momentum of an otherwise powerful ending.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. Sentences like "The late afternoon sun bled into dusk" create a vivid atmosphere. However, a few phrases, such as "a single, bland narrative of peaceful progress," feel slightly more like authorial summary than the character's immediate perception. This is a minor point in an otherwise pristine piece of writing with no technical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with high information density in most lines. The figurative language, such as "aural threads stitching the dangerous brilliance," is fresh and effective. A minor recurring tendency to label an emotional state ("eerie nostalgia," "profoundly sad") rather than purely embodying it is the only element holding the prose back from perfection, representing a slight move toward summary in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is rich with inventive, evocative imagery ("a place of perpetual twilight where the boughs of ancient trees cradled the very clouds"). The rhythm is controlled and sentences are well-crafted. The primary weakness is the tense-breaking sentence at the climax, a significant craft misstep. Minor issues include slightly clichéd phrasing ("heart thrummed a wild, un-orderly rhythm") and the cumbersome repetition of "moonstone cabochon dust speck."

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with high information density in most lines. However, the moment of epiphany relies slightly more on telling than showing. A cluster of sentences summarizes the compass's function ("The compass rose, she realized, didn’t chart land, but pathways...") rather than dramatizing the deduction. This moment of crucial insight feels slightly rushed and summarized, momentarily flattening the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and largely flawless, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are well-constructed and propel the narrative forward with a quiet, deliberate momentum. A hairline flaw exists in phrases like "This was her kintsugi intentions," where the direct insertion of the concept feels slightly less integrated into the prose rhythm than the rest of the piece, a minor artifact that keeps it just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often elegant, but it occasionally slips into overwriting with phrases like "brilliant, white-hot radiance." There is also a minor paraphrase loop in the final paragraph ("The hidden sunrise was no longer hidden..."). While the line-level craft is generally strong and propulsive, these moments of imprecision slightly dull the sharpness required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and demonstrates high craft, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences like "a living cartography of his own pain" are potent and precise. There is a slight tendency towards telling what has just been shown, as in "This was a trauma response," which momentarily creates a minor paraphrase loop, but the overall momentum and clarity remain very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and demonstrates high information density. However, the climactic description contains a minor cliché: "an eternal instant, a sliver of time that stretched into infinity, yet was over in a heartbeat." While functional, this slightly generic phrasing momentarily dulls the sharpness of an otherwise unique and specific experience, representing a small missed opportunity in the story's most critical beat.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. However, a few minor blemishes, like the slightly clichéd phrase "The pieces clicked into place" and the too-direct summary "The secret had killed her," momentarily flatten the otherwise sharp execution. These are small flaws but prevent an otherwise excellent piece from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, strong verbs, and elegant figurative language that serves the story's atmosphere. Sentences are constructed with a clear sense of rhythm and purpose, propelling the narrative forward without wasted words. A couple of minor stock phrases ("heart a frantic drum against her ribs") are the only hairline flaws in an otherwise polished and evocative prose performance.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with a high information density. However, there is a minor stumble in the description of the glyphs' meaning: the sentence beginning "They spoke of a great sorrow..." becomes a sequence of near-synonymous abstractions that slightly dulls the momentum of the discovery. While the surrounding prose is sharp, this brief instance of overwriting prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lyrical and evocative, with strong verbs and a confident rhythm. However, there's a slight tendency towards dense, abstract declarations, particularly in the opening paragraph ("reclaim the light stolen by midnight, a metaphorical darkness..."). While this establishes the concept, it verges on telling rather than showing. The execution in the action- and vision-oriented beats, however, is sharp, clear, and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in its descriptions ("flowstones cascaded like frozen waterfalls"). The rhythm and syntax vary effectively to match the story's momentum, from the deliberate setup to the still, awed climax. The piece is almost entirely free of scaffolding or redundancy, creating a clean, immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the momentum is occasionally slowed by conceptual phrases that feel more like authorial labels than organic thought, such as "timewoven alliances" and the repetition of "scaffold complexity with simplicity." This conceptual redundancy acts as a minor prose artifact, preventing the piece from reaching the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, with high information density and precise, evocative imagery. Sentences are well-crafted and rhythmically controlled. A few phrases, like "a sense of umbral tenderness" or the final internal summary, lean slightly towards abstraction over concrete embodiment, representing minor slips in an otherwise masterful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in the opening and the lagoon scene ("sun a bleached coin in a white sky"). There are no significant technical flaws. The piece is held back from a higher score by a few phrases that drift toward the abstract, such as "parley with this remnant of trauma," and a final sentence that, while elegant, feels slightly too summarizing and overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative ("spectral glow," "grinding cognitive process") without becoming overwrought. The piece is remarkably clean, showing no evidence of scaffolding, paraphrase loops, or other artifacts that would dull its momentum. Every sentence serves a clear purpose, building toward a final line that lands with immense weight and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control without a single wasted word. Figurative language, such as grief being a "riptide" or the "woolen silence," is both beautiful and precise. The sentences are propulsive and clear, building momentum toward a climax that is rendered with stark, powerful simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and largely flawless. Imagery is vivid and purposeful, and sentence structure varies to control pacing effectively, especially during the climactic ritual. While a few phrases like "controlled storm of intention wrapped in an absolute calm" border on redundancy, the overall craft is exceptionally clean, with no momentum-dragging artifacts or overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, with strong sensory details. There are minor, infrequent issues with prose artifacts that dull momentum, such as the slightly templated repetition of "She would trust... trust... and trust" in the resolution. While generally concise, a few sentences carry explanatory clauses that could be trimmed for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise. However, the final two paragraphs engage in conceptual looping, restating the central epiphany multiple times with slightly different phrasing ("He understood his purpose... He saw not just the death... The flourishing stillness was not an absence..."). This redundancy dulls the momentum and impact of the otherwise strong closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, several moments of strategic telling feel more like authorial explanation, creating minor prose artifacts. Lines like "He had to understand it through contextual clues" and the direct explanation of the box's function ("it was a conduit") slightly mar the line-level craft by summarizing an internal process that the story is otherwise brilliantly showing.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong, evocative imagery. However, a few sentences in the final paragraph, such as "She had come to catalogue the past but had instead rediscovered a continuum," lean toward summarizing the theme rather than fully embodying the final moments of realization. This slightly flattens an otherwise powerful and imagistic ending, reading more like an authorial explanation than a character's final lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished and often stunning, with high information density and precise, evocative word choices. The rhythm is varied and controlled, creating a propulsive yet meditative momentum. A few phrases, like "shimmering with a thousand captured dawns," lean toward being overwrought, and the final paragraph contains some thematic restatements that feel slightly redundant. These are minor blemishes on an otherwise impeccable surface.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and purposeful, with high information density in each sentence. Phrasing like "a quiet, clinical thunderclap" and "deep-time memories" is evocative without being overwrought. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors Elara's own "gentle systematics," building momentum cleanly toward the climax. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, demonstrating polished, professional craft.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with a strong sense of rhythm from the opening sentence. Word choice is precise and evocative, and there are no wasted sentences or line-level artifacts like loops or scaffolding. The craftsmanship is clean and professional, creating momentum and atmosphere simultaneously without sacrificing clarity at any point.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and rhythmic, with high information density. However, its reliance on figurative language is so consistent that it occasionally borders on being overwrought, slightly dulling the impact of individual images through sheer volume. A few phrases, like "indigo bleeding into the horizon," lean toward cliché, and the final paragraph summarizes established character traits rather than purely advancing through image.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific, memorable images. The rhythm and syntax support the somber, deliberate pacing. The only minor weakness is a tendency in the final third to summarize insights that could have remained implicit. Lines like "The voice described a world of green..." and the explicit decoding of the riddle are less impactful than the purely imagistic moments, creating a slight momentum drag just before the otherwise flawless conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled, rhythmic cadence. Sentences are well-constructed and information-dense. The piece is slightly held back by a few moments of on-the-nose phrasing that explain the emotional mechanics ("The act was no longer just ritual; it was an act of defiance"), which could have been left implicit in the potent action of sketching.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("a deep, bruised violet shot through with veins of shimmering gold"). Sentence structure is varied, and the pacing is controlled, building tension effectively. While a few phrases verge on the familiar ("heart a drum against her ribs"), the overall craft is clean, concise, and free of momentum-draining artifacts, allowing the story’s core strengths to shine.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with memorable phrasing like "luminous absence" and "nomadic penumbra." Momentum is well-maintained. The score is slightly tempered by a few instances of overt authorial guidance, such as calling the chessboard "a perfect metaphor," which tells the reader how to interpret an image the prose has already made clear.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the story's contemplative-to-revelatory arc. The piece avoids nearly all line-level artifacts; however, a minor awkwardness in "noting the method of its texture, a perfect, intricate softness" is a hairline slip in an otherwise flawless execution. It doesn't impact the clarity of the pivotal moment, but prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with high information content in each line. Figurative language, such as the "woven hush" and the tapestry as a "map of strategic choices," is not ornamental but foundational to the plot and theme. The sentences are well-structured and propulsive, showing excellent control and avoiding any noticeable loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative from the opening sentence. Word choice is precise and imagery is strong without becoming overwrought, achieving a high degree of momentum and clarity. A couple of phrases, such as "His motivation was simple, yet impossible," lean slightly toward telling, but are used so efficiently they barely register as flaws. The overall line-level craft is exceptional, with no loops, scaffolding, or rhythmic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and purposeful, with high information density. However, there are minor repetitive artifacts. The central motif of "breaths held underwater" is restated in slightly different ways three times, which starts to feel like a loop rather than a progression. Similarly, the verb "quilted memories together" is used twice in close succession. These small redundancies slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a few phrases lean towards summarizing the theme rather than embodying it, such as "a visual echo of a promise" and "the concept of a beautiful, fleeting moment." These moments of thematic telling, while brief, slightly reduce the overall immediacy and prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates exceptional line-level craft. The opening sentence is a model of atmospheric writing, and the piece maintains a high level of information density and rhythmic control throughout. Figurative language, such as "the silence...was a physical presence" and the oxymoronic "screaming tenderness," is both original and precise. There are no wasted words, scaffold, or loops; every sentence works to advance character, atmosphere, or plot with clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exceptional: precise, evocative, and dense with meaning. Word choices like "skeletal," "patchwork," and "quilt" are both descriptive and thematic. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere. The rhythm is controlled and poetic, achieving a high level of literary craft without ever becoming overwrought or unclear, even in its most figurative moments.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is clean, confident, and demonstrates high information density. Sentences are crafted for rhythmic effect and clarity, propelling the narrative forward without unnecessary scaffolding. While overwhelmingly strong, a few phrases like "a symptom of the world’s sickness" verge on being slightly too declarative, a minor friction in an otherwise excellent execution. There are no significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong, specific imagery and a compelling rhythm. Sentences are crafted with care and density. There are, however, a few minor instances of telling over showing that slightly blunt the momentum, such as "He decided his method would be by observing gaps," which feels more procedural than a natural thought process. These are small blemishes on an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with high information density and strong rhythm. The opening line is particularly effective. A minor flaw appears in the climax with a slight paraphrase loop ("This was the doorway of decisions. It was not a physical door, but a conceptual one... that was the doorway"), which momentarily softens the propulsive clarity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is excellent, marked by vivid, precise language and a confident, poetic rhythm. Sentences like "a vision of bleeding starlight, a celestial wound weeping light that fell not as rain but as a slow, shimmering mist" demonstrate high information density and command of imagery. While the prose is consistently elevated, it avoids becoming overwrought, and there are no notable loops, redundancies, or other prose artifacts that impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong sensory details like "words tasting of ash" and "liquid light." The rhythm is well-paced and sentences are generally concise. There are a few instances of slightly overwritten, abstract phrasing ("density of presence," "palette of resolve") that feel more like authorial concepts than character-level perceptions, momentarily thinning the otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exceptional: concise, evocative, and free of artifacts. Figurative language, such as the scroll being "veined like old skin" or the sky being "bruised purple and orange," is both beautiful and purposeful. Sentence structure is varied, propelling the narrative forward with a confident rhythm that never falters, culminating in a simple, declarative final paragraph that lands with immense power.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. There are, however, a few moments that lean into overwriting, such as describing fingers that "mapped an emotional terrain far deeper than the physical object." While impactful, such phrases tell the reader the emotional weight rather than letting the action alone convey it, a minor imperfection in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. The rhythm is controlled, building and releasing tension effectively. A minor weakness appears in the final paragraph, which relies on a few abstract labels ("a lesson learned," "weakness alchemized into armor") that summarize the theme rather than letting the powerful final image do all the work. This slight shift toward telling pulls the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise for most of the story, with high information density and evocative imagery ("last light bled from the sky," "a chasm carved by a cruel, offhand remark"). The rhythm is controlled and serves the melancholic tone. The final block of Elara's dialogue, however, slips into a slightly less crafted, more declarative mode which momentarily disrupts the otherwise stellar line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, there are minor instances of repetitive sentence structures in the opening paragraphs that create a slightly mechanical cadence. The most significant flaw is the thematic summary in the final paragraph, which is a craft issue that sacrifices momentum and subtlety for didactic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, with high information density and strong sensory details. Sentences like "The world outside the hut felt still, as if the fjord itself were holding its breath" demonstrate masterful control. A minor deduction is warranted for the final paragraph's slight drift into abstraction, which briefly pulls away from the concrete, embodied prose that characterizes the rest of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and precise imagery ("two celestial bodies in a silent orbit," "a woman who built fences in the air"). The rhythm shifts appropriately from the contemplative opening to the urgency of the crisis. While exceptionally strong, the final two sentences shift from showing to summarizing the thematic takeaway, a minor lapse in an otherwise flawless execution that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and high-quality, with strong rhythm and precise, evocative word choice ("etched dice," "shimmering possibilities"). Information density is high, with most sentences serving character and atmosphere simultaneously. There are moments where the figurative language is so dense it borders on overwriting ("a clover melancholy hanging over the gleaming city"), but it generally succeeds within a literary context. The final sentence, "She finally did," is a minor letdown after the preceding powerful imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is luminous and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally relies on abstract conceptual labels ("a cultivated estrangement," "a meditation on the nature of closure") where a more embodied description might have been stronger. This tendency toward abstraction is a minor but noticeable tic that slightly distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience. Despite this, the overall craft is precise, clear, and highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates high information density. However, a few moments verge on over-explaining the emotional state, such as the direct parsing of "The euphoria came from... the haunt from..." This slightly diminishes the subtext, acting as a minor thematic summary. While it doesn't harm the closure, this touch of explicit labeling in a peak beat prevents the piece from achieving absolute perfection on the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise for most of the story, with strong imagery and varied sentence rhythms. Momentum is excellent until the final paragraph, which leans slightly into summary ("She had built a machine not for distributing goods, but for distributing grace"). This moment of telling, rather than showing, mildly dulls the potent closure image by explaining its meaning, constituting a minor prose artifact at a critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense with imagery, demonstrating strong command of rhythm and syntax. However, a few moments rely on slightly familiar phrasing ("breadcrumb path") or summary. The line listing the emotions of stone, sunlight, and a fallen tree tells the reader the translation's content rather than letting us experience its effect through Elara, a minor dip into summary at a peak sensory moment.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is clean, concise, and carries a strong forward momentum, with high information density in each sentence. There are no distracting loops, scaffold phrases, or overwrought metaphors. The language is precise and purposeful, achieving a technical yet emotionally resonant quality that perfectly suits the story's tone and subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery. There are, however, a few moments where momentum is slightly dulled by telling, such as the sequence, "A fierce protectiveness rose in Elara. She would not let this stand. She understood what she must do." This brief shift to a more procedural internal summary stands out against the otherwise seamless "show, don't tell" craft.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choices are precise and evocative, with phrases like "surgical, a controlled rage" doing significant work. The piece is remarkably clean, with no discernible scaffolding, loops, or overwritten passages, even at moments of high emotion. Its clarity and concision demonstrate a high level of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative ("auroral sorrow," "entangled song"), and the sentence structure varies to create a compelling rhythm. While highly figurative, the language rarely feels overwritten, instead serving to build the story's unique atmosphere. The piece is free of technical artifacts, loops, or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, with nearly every sentence advancing the narrative. Phrasing like "creases worn soft as velvet" and "a small service hatch sighed open" shows a strong command of language. The only minor stumble is the final sentence, which slightly over-explains the victory ("proven her thesis utterly true") when the preceding image had already made the point with more elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise. However, a few moments of slight overwriting hold it back from top marks. The repetition of "spiralingly calm" is noticeable, and phrases like "a seismic approval" for a small nod feel overwrought. These instances, while minor, are slight blemishes in an otherwise beautifully crafted piece, preventing it from reaching the highest tier of prose perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and highly polished, with memorable phrasing like "forests of second thoughts." However, in a few key moments, the figurative language becomes slightly overwrought, threatening to draw attention to itself. Phrases such as "a sound that demanded the universe listen" and "magnetic grotto" reach for a lyricism that momentarily tips into abstraction, slightly softening the impact of an otherwise grounded and powerful scene.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with a strong rhythmic quality. However, a few phrases like "a study in fluid grace" or "efficiency that bordered on art" lean toward polished cliché. The line "The great song was a key, and the scrimshaw was the tumbler" is a moment of telling that slightly undermines the otherwise potent symbolism. These are minor flaws in an otherwise clean and propulsive text.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is polished, concise, and highly evocative, with high information density in every line. Figurative language, such as "shavings collecting like pale tears" and "sanding the edges of his sorrow," is fresh and integral, not ornamental. The piece demonstrates excellent rhythmic control, shifting from the monotonous thrum of the opening to the profound stillness of the end without a single wasted word or clumsy construction.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often stunning. However, a few minor artifacts prevent a top-tier score. The opening sentence contains a slight paraphrase loop ("hush... quiet"), and a line like "This is her method" acts as a form of scaffolding. While these instances are rare and do not harm the closure, they represent small blemishes in an otherwise immaculate line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density. Sentences like "hands scarred by countless beautiful mistakes" do significant character work with great economy. The rhythm and word choice are consistently strong and evocative. The primary flaw is a minor paraphrase loop during the climax: "he was asking, persuading, communicating through plant arrangements," which restates the method unnecessarily and momentarily slows the otherwise excellent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. The piece is slightly weakened by a few instances of over-articulation in the final two paragraphs, such as "a weaver of audial golden shadows" and "a new and profound awareness of each other." These phrases summarize the effect rather than trusting the scene to convey it, a minor impurity in otherwise polished prose.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is often elegant and precise, with strong opening and closing images ("dust motes dancing," "seed of subdued ardor"). However, it occasionally slips into abstract or slightly overwrought phrasing, such as "curtains of intention" or "a piece about artificiality," which reads more like critical analysis than lived experience. While generally concise, these moments of conceptual summary slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and maintains momentum effectively. There is a recurring minor flaw in the use of slightly stock phrases to describe interiority, such as "curiosity ignited into a focused blaze" or "revelation swelling inside her." These moments of telling, rather than showing, stand out against the otherwise high quality of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and often stunning, with powerful, concise imagery. However, its relentless lyricism occasionally borders on overwriting, with figurative language so dense it slightly slows momentum. For instance, "a steadily unpredictable anguish, a joy so profound it curdled into grief" is a powerful idea but its phrasing is a mouthful that summarizes more than it embodies. The craft is high, but a touch more restraint in key moments would increase its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and standout figurative language ("a sorrowful glow, like that of a dying star"). The rhythm is well-paced and clear. It is kept from the highest tier by a few phrases that lean on slightly familiar genre constructions ("a darkness that moved with a purpose all its own," "not a flaw but a feature"), which slightly dull the otherwise sharp specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong imagery ("curled like a question mark," "a world of mist and stars bearing witness"). However, momentum is slightly impaired by paragraphs that function as scaffolding, explaining the psychological mechanism rather than dramatizing it (e.g., the "shedding layers" paragraph). These moments of telling, rather than showing, create a minor drag in an otherwise propulsive and beautifully rendered piece.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by a strong internal rhythm, demonstrating masterful control at the line level. Figurative language, such as "meteor hush" and "a star fallen into the wrong sky," is both original and precise. There is no scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic monotony; every sentence works to advance character, atmosphere, or plot with remarkable economy and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, clear, and often poetic, with strong sensory details and a controlled rhythm. The line "The world of the booth dissolved" is a perfect, concise transition. A minor weakness appears in slightly abstract, analytical phrasing like "propelled by the man’s spatially imaginative solution to his problem," which momentarily breaks from the more embodied prose. Otherwise, the piece is free of loops or significant artifacts, demonstrating high-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with vivid imagery and a strong rhythmic quality. However, a few lines veer towards thematic summary, slightly flattening the immediacy of the realization (e.g., "The creativity she sought to free was not hers alone; it was the universe's"). While effective, this nudges the line from showing into strategic telling, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and largely elegant, with strong, memorable phrases like "a still lake" for the mind and "a monochrome of ash and regret." However, a few moments rely on slightly overwrought or familiar sci-fi abstractions ("a hurricane of might-bes and never-weres") that slightly diminish the overall precision. The sentence structure varies well, creating a compelling rhythm, and there are no significant line-level artifacts, but it doesn't quite achieve the flawless density required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in most lines. However, the final two paragraphs contain moments of thematic summary that slightly reduce propulsion, such as "The entire mechanical rainforest was not a prison... but a nursery." The final sentence's turn of phrase, "the journey’s end and its true beginning," is a minor cliché that slightly dulls an otherwise sharp and resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("a dark slice of shadow," "the soft rasp of water on stone"). The rhythm is controlled and propulsive. A minor deduction is warranted for the final paragraph, which has a slight summarizing quality ("He had traversed... And in doing so, he had found..."), a small loop that explains the outcome instead of letting the preceding action and image suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific sensory details. However, the final paragraph contains a paraphrase loop that weakens the closure. The sentences "Elara understood. The cost of safety was memory. It was connection. It was the raw, unfiltered truth" restate the theme just delivered by the journal. This redundancy slightly stalls the momentum and explains the emotional resonance rather than letting it land through the final image of the shared smile.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and highly polished, demonstrating strong command of rhythm and imagery. However, there is a tendency toward high adjectival density ("diminutive titan," "immense, patient power," "profound black") that occasionally verges on being overwritten. While effective, a more restrained approach in key moments could have increased the propulsion and impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied to great effect, mirroring the narrative's momentum and Kael's internal state. Information density is high, with phrases like "a morse code of boredom and anxiety" doing immense character and atmospheric work. While the register is consistently high and literary, it avoids overt purple prose, and there are no significant loops or scaffolding to dull its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with high information density and evocative figurative language that feels earned and consistent. Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm that carries the reader through the story’s atmospheric shifts. There are no notable line-level artifacts; every word serves the story's momentum and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choices like "skeletal scaffolds" and "collective, patient wisdom" are both precise and evocative. The sentence structure varies to control rhythm, slowing for moments of concentration and quickening during the climax. A minor weakness is the use of a few common phrases ("heart hammered against her ribs") and a slight tendency toward thematic summary in the final paragraph, which slightly dilutes the power of the otherwise impeccable scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is clean, confident, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Sentence structure and rhythm vary to match the emotional tenor of the scene, accelerating into crisis and calming into resolution. Word choice is precise and evocative, particularly in its descriptions of somatic experience and the natural world. There are no notable loops, scaffolds, or other prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and rhythmic, with high information density in each sentence. Figurative language is strong and coherent, particularly the central "luminescent ache" motif. A minor flaw is a small moment of redundancy in the final paragraph, which slightly paraphrases the thematic result of the preceding action rather than letting the image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control without a single wasted word. The prose avoids scaffolding and loops, using precise, evocative language ("pattern-drunk stain," "a technological ghost") to build atmosphere and advance the plot. It is polished, professional, and immediately publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with a strong opening and a resonant closing line. Clarity and momentum are excellent. A few sentences feel slightly overwritten, striving for profundity rather than letting the action carry the weight, such as the lengthy description of the "moment of decision." These are minor blemishes on an otherwise impeccable surface.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and evocative for the most part, with strong imagery like the "cooling ember" rose and the "missing tooth" spire. There is a minor, repetitive prose artifact in the dual use of "senselessly perceptive" that feels slightly forced. Overall momentum and clarity remain high, especially at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and a varied, compelling rhythm. Figurative language is not ornamental but foundational to the world-building itself. A minor paraphrase loop ("The tone of the world was a feral lullaby, a savage yet soothing melody") is the only noticeable imperfection in an otherwise polished piece. The craft is clean, purposeful, and free of artifacts that would impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and ambitious, with strong figurative language and a varied sentence structure that propels the narrative forward. However, a few moments lean toward telling rather than showing (e.g., "The proof was irrefutable") and rely on slightly familiar constructions. These instances are minor but momentarily soften the otherwise sharp and impactful line-level craft, keeping it just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with high information density in its imagery ("jagged, screaming spectrograms"). However, the figurative language is so consistently elevated ("a collapsed star, its gravity pulling everything back to its center") that it occasionally risks feeling overwritten, slightly impeding momentum in favor of poetic abstraction. The final climactic sentences, however, are laudably clean and direct, ensuring the closure lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a few sentences employ a scaffold-like structure ("The circles were not just circles; they were...") that momentarily tells rather than shows. The density of figurative language borders on overwriting in places, slightly impeding momentum in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong momentum. Lines like "a sky webbed with fractures of impossible light" are superb. The score is slightly tempered by a moment of clunky repetition ("the mosaic stone had offered her another way, a method via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone") and a final line that feels a touch cliché, preventing an otherwise excellent piece from reaching the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, with high information density in nearly every line. Figurative language is both beautiful and functional, particularly in describing Leo's synesthetic experiences ("the scent of blooming jasmine sounded like a distant choir"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the read-aloud rhythm is excellent and propels the narrative forward.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative sensory details. However, the final paragraph becomes slightly overwritten and abstract. The phrase “willowglass hope” is an artificial coinage that lands with less force than the concrete image it describes. Explaining the image as the “architecture of memory itself” and detailing its meaning (“fragile and transparent yet strong…”) tells the reader what to feel, dulling the closure image’s immediacy and creating a minor artifact issue at a critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and generally effective, with a steady rhythm that supports the story's momentum. However, it is held back from excellence by a few instances of abstract emotional language ("profound, aching loss") and scaffolding ("It was a factually mystical process..."). These moments slightly dull the immediacy and information density required for the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with evocative and precise language. The score is slightly tempered by occasional moments of telling over showing ("The prophecy... was not a prediction, but a warning") and a few phrases that lean toward abstraction or cliché ("symphony of potential"). These instances are minor but momentarily pull back from the otherwise concrete and imagistic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative from the opening line. Phrasing like "a map of old pain" and "a language written in frozen water" demonstrates a high level of craft. There's a slight wobble with the paragraph summarizing the commander's motives ("He hadn't betrayed her; he had been compromised..."), which leans more towards telling than showing in a moment of peak revelation. However, this is a minor flaw in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece with excellent rhythm and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with high information density in its descriptions. However, a few phrases slightly abstract the moment rather than embody it, such as stating Elias's motivation is "to distill complexity into essence" or Linnea's realization as "a quiet, devastating clarity." These are minor intrusions in an otherwise impeccable piece, slightly telling what the rest of the story shows so effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and demonstrates high information density without a single wasted word. Sentences are rhythmically varied and precise, as in the opening line's "slow, viscous flattening of chimney smoke." The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or any other artifacts, resulting in a clean, propulsive, and highly immersive read.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density, with images like "a sheet of black glass shattered by the silver trails" achieving both beauty and narrative purpose. The rhythm is controlled and varies with the scene's needs. The score is held just below the 9+ band due to a few instances of thematic summary in the final paragraphs ("turned loss into light") which, while not a loop, function as a minor form of scaffolding that tells what has just been powerfully shown. Otherwise, the line-level craft is nearly flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most lines. However, a minor paraphrase loop ("The isolation... began to feel like a cage. Her independence... was slipping away into sheer loneliness.") slightly impedes momentum mid-story. While the line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong and the closure is immaculate, this small redundancy keeps it just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong, evocative imagery. However, it occasionally relies on abstractions and clichés that tell rather than show ("The thought was a key turning in a lock"). The density of figurative language, while fitting the character's voice, sometimes feels overwrought, slightly distancing the reader from the raw emotion the story describes.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, with strong verbs and evocative images like "the audio equivalent of a lockpick." Momentum is well-maintained. The score is slightly reduced due to a prose artifact at the climax and resolution, where the narrative shifts from showing the effects to telling the mechanics ("The divisive anger, she realized, had been artificially amplified..."). This summary flattens the discovery in a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatically sound, but it suffers from a tendency toward overwriting, particularly in the opening. Phrases like "claustrophobic explorer heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic bird in a stone cage" and the abstract "spatial mutiny, a rebellion of geometry against logic" are dense and lean toward purple prose. While the writing is evocative, this lack of concision and reliance on elaborate descriptors in high-pressure moments slightly dulls the story's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is largely excellent, with strong, evocative imagery and a confident rhythm. However, a few moments slip into less polished phrasing. Formulations like "lance the wound...drain the poison" and "a devastating wave of feeling" are slightly clichéd compared to the originality of the surrounding prose, and stating her motivation explicitly is a minor tell-not-show moment.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, propulsive, and demonstrates high information density with evocative figurative language. However, the key atmospheric phrase "spongey dread" is repeated three times, which begins to feel like a prose artifact rather than intentional reinforcement. This repetition slightly dulls the impact of an otherwise precise and elegant line-level execution, representing a minor but noticeable flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("a statue of sound and light"). However, a few moments exhibit a conceptual density that borders on being overwritten, particularly in the second paragraph's rapid string of metaphors for the ruined plate. While effective, this density slightly impedes momentum, a minor friction in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("sky a deep bruise of purple and orange"). Momentum is well-maintained. The score is lowered due to the final thematic paragraphs, which contain paraphrase loops that restate the central idea ("Paths circle back..." and "They were all trapped by their natures...") instead of allowing the final image to do the work. This redundancy slightly dulls an otherwise sharp piece.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and maintains a consistent rhythm. Word choice is generally strong and specific. The main weakness is a tendency to summarize key moments of realization and action, such as "Understanding dawned, cold and brilliant" and "She spoke until she felt the dreamer’s restlessness settle," which tells the reader the outcome rather than immersing them in the process.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong verbs and evocative imagery, especially in the first half ("pulling ancient trees into its gyre like splinters"). Momentum is excellent, and sentences are dense with purpose. Minor blemishes, such as the cliché "understanding blooms within her" and a single typo ("flash-frold"), prevent a higher score, as they slightly soften the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there is a tendency toward high conceptual density and abstraction that can slow momentum, as in "a stalled moment of cosmic adjustment that had thrown all natural law into disarray." Some phrasing reads as slightly overwritten or overly analytical for a character in a high-stakes moment, creating a minor drag on propulsion. The overall craft is strong, with no significant technical errors or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and concise, with strong verbs and specific imagery. Momentum is well-maintained. A minor weakness is the slight repetition of key thematic phrases like "inlaying meaning everywhere" and "fiercely gentle." While establishing core concepts, their repetition borders on becoming a label rather than purely showing, which slightly flattens the texture in those specific moments but does not significantly impede the story's powerful flow.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally well-paced, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The opening paragraph is particularly effective. The fifth paragraph contains some conceptual repetition and a slightly templated sentence structure ("His purpose wasn't... But that wasn't... His purpose hadn't been..."), which momentarily dulls the momentum before the strong final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative sensory details. However, there are minor moments where momentum is slightly dulled by explanation over dramatization. The paragraph detailing the analogical insight, for instance, reads more like a summary of a thought process than an embodied epiphany, and a few adjacent sentences offer conceptual paraphrases rather than new information.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with high information density. However, there are minor instances of scaffolding where the prose explains the process rather than relying purely on the image, such as, "It was a violent act made serene, a breaking down to build up." While a small flaw, it momentarily steps out of the immersive sensory experience to offer a summary, holding the line-level craft just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. There are, however, minor moments of abstract summary that function as prose artifacts, such as describing the pearl as "the physical manifestation of that collective sorrow." While effective, this analytical language creates a slight register drift that momentarily pulls back from the embodied experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and polished, with strong, specific imagery ("a sound as ragged as the breath of the accordion"). The rhythm is controlled, creating a somber, methodical momentum. There are a few instances of abstract summary ("Her motivation, a fragile and desperate thing") where a more concrete embodiment would be stronger, but these are minor. The piece is free of significant loops or artifacts, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, but it occasionally drifts into abstraction or relies on summary where concrete action would be stronger. There is a slight paraphrase loop in the final paragraph, where several sentences restate the story's core thematic discovery in different ways. While the line-level craft is generally high, these moments of slight redundancy and declarative phrasing hold it back from true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and evocative imagery. The sentence-level craft is strong, avoiding clutter and demonstrating a fine ear for rhythm. The final two sentences, while effective, lean slightly toward summarizing the outcome ("beyond anyone’s claim," "music free") rather than letting the preceding image carry the full weight, which is a minor reservation in an otherwise excellent piece.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and highly polished, with virtually no wasted words. Sentences like "Its silence was not empty, but full, a radiant hush that held the memory of sound" demonstrate superb line-level craft. The rhythm and syntax vary to match the story's meditative pace, creating a powerfully immersive and beautiful reading experience without overwriting or artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, clear, and often elegant, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The rhythm is well-paced, slowing for reflection and moving with purpose during action. There are no significant prose artifacts like loops or overwritten passages. A minor weakness is the slightly repetitive syntactic structure in the final paragraph ("She had been looking for... But the source was not... It was the doing..."), which feels more explanatory than evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, a few moments of explanatory scaffolding slightly dull the momentum. The line "He was terrified of his own hesitation, so he clothed himself in the cloak of doubt..." functions as a paraphrase loop, explaining a psychological state that the actions already dramatize, preventing an otherwise exceptional piece of prose from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with memorable phrases like "sycamore hush" and "a silent explosion of geometry." The line-level craft is strong, with good rhythm and clarity. Minor slips into stock phrasing ("tapestry of deep greens") and a single instance of narrative scaffolding prevent it from reaching the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, clean, and highly effective, marked by strong verbs and specific imagery ("twisted and coiled like smoke," "plucked it from the dust"). The rhythm is controlled, building momentum without rushing. Some conceptual phrases, while fitting the tone ("collective, eternal hum," "recursive echoes"), occasionally lean towards abstraction where a more concrete sensory detail might have landed with even greater force. Nonetheless, the line-level craft is very strong, with no technical errors or momentum-killing artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in the evocative descriptions of the spire. However, the final paragraph contains a minor paraphrase loop where the central idea of finding value in a simple, caring act is stated and then restated in slightly different terms. This momentarily slows the momentum and feels like unnecessary scaffolding on an otherwise powerful and self-evident conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong, with evocative and precise language ("a constellation reversing its course"). Momentum is well-maintained through clean syntax. The primary weakness is a moment of summarizing prose at the very end ("He had discovered the color of sound, and in doing so, had come home..."), which restates the accomplishment rather than trusting the preceding powerful imagery to convey the resolution. This brief lapse into telling slightly dulls the otherwise sharp impact of the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and purposeful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("churning, grey morass of pure potential," "crystallized" static). Sentence structure varies to create a compelling rhythm that carries the story's momentum from a contemplative opening to a focused, intense climax. There is a minor reliance on a slightly generic simile ("like trying to hear a single voice in a hurricane"), but the overall execution is pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and purposeful, with very few wasted words. Figurative language, such as the “constellation of sorrowful gems,” is both beautiful and functional. The sentence structure varies to control rhythm, effectively building from the steady, ritualistic pace to the trembling effort of the climax without a single loop or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is impeccable. Phrases like “a bridge of woven light and solidified sky” and “soldering the fractures with solidified song” are both beautiful and precise. The prose is dense with meaning and imagery, yet remains clear and propulsive. There are no wasted words or indulgent descriptions; every sentence serves to advance the atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, marked by high information density and evocative imagery. Sentences are crafted with a poet's ear for rhythm and precision, creating momentum without a single wasted word. There are no notable loops or scaffolding artifacts. The only minor weakness is a slight shift toward summary in the final paragraph, where phrases like "He understood his task" feel less immediate than the concrete, sensory prose that precedes them. Despite this, the line-level craft remains exceptional throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with powerful lines like the crystal weeping "not with water, but with light." There is a high density of evocative language, which occasionally risks becoming overwritten in the opening paragraph. The final paragraph's parallel sentence structure ("Logic had provided... Intuition had provided...") reads as a minor scaffold, slightly slowing the momentum of an otherwise powerful final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often elegant, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, the piece is marred by minor but noticeable repetition of key phrases ("attentively inventive," "remembering through muscle memory," "soundless echo"). This scaffolding, while thematically relevant, reads as an authorial artifact rather than organic prose, slightly dulling the momentum and polish required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, concise, and carries a strong rhythmic quality. Figurative language, such as Rin's words "slicing through pretense with the precision of a razor," is consistently sharp and integrated. The climax risks overwriting with its cosmic scale ("grief so deep it could drown stars"), but the established setting earns this escalation. The piece is free of line-level artifacts, demonstrating a high degree of craft and control.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, clear, and generally effective. However, it occasionally relies on elevated but somewhat generic phrases like "storm-born silence" or "cerebral quiet" that feel more writerly than character-driven. While grammatically sound, the sentence structure lacks the propulsive variety and information density that would elevate it to a higher tier, particularly in the moments of summary and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is strong, vivid, and rhythmic. However, a few lines slightly over-explain the metaphor, pulling back from pure subtext (e.g., “This was not mere yard work; it was a symphony of remembrance”). While the imagery is powerful, these moments of explicit statement create a minor drag on momentum and prevent the piece from achieving flawless execution at the line level, keeping it just shy of the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, but it is marred by moments of authorial scaffolding that break immersion. The line "the truth was perfectly obvious" tells the reader how to interpret the scene instead of trusting the imagery. This, combined with other expository framing ("Tonight, her motivation was clear"), reads like residual draft material that should have been rendered through action.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and largely flawless, with strong rhythm and precise word choice, particularly in the climactic sequence ("un-weave, its atomic bonds dissolving"). There is a minor instance of conceptual redundancy in the first paragraph ("stagnation," "stifling loop," "repeat") that slightly dulls the opening momentum. However, the craft in the pivotal final third is immaculate and free of any artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly efficient, with exceptional word choice ("serenely electric," "a shard of hush"). Information density is high, with nearly every sentence serving character, atmosphere, and momentum simultaneously. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the read-aloud quality is superb, and the syntax shifts to match the story's descent into silence.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and often evocative, with strong sensory details and well-crafted figurative language ("fading like breath on glass"). The rhythm and pacing are generally effective, driving the narrative forward. However, the piece occasionally relies on narrative shortcuts and abstract summary, particularly in describing Leo's sudden understanding and the thematic wrap-up, which lessens the impact of key moments by telling rather than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often brilliant, with evocative, high-density lines ("cartographer of the subconscious," "silent, psychic detonation"). However, minor flaws detract from its polish; these include typos ("yawnedled," "mandela") and a few phrases that feel slightly overworked or cliché ("a truth so profound it could only express itself violently"). While powerful, these small slips prevent the line-level craft from reaching flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, rhythmic precision, and powerful, concise phrasing. Lines like “We spent centuries charting the crease in the paper. Now we must learn the shape of the whole page” are both beautiful and structurally essential. The prose is entirely free of scaffolding or redundancy, demonstrating a rare level of polish and control.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong imagery and sentence variety. However, a few moments rely on summary or labeling over dramatization (e.g., "Her persistent curiosity had uncovered the need"). The final paragraph, while effective, contains a sentence that summarizes the theme ("Her work was always done in the shadows...") rather than letting the final actions carry the full weight, creating minor momentum drag right at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, propulsive, and often evocative, with high information density. Sentences are well-constructed, and the rhythm effectively mirrors the story's pacing, from the slow, tense exploration to the frantic escape. While a few phrases feel familiar, the overall craft is strong and free of loops, scaffolding, or other prose artifacts that would impede momentum. The description of the phase transition as a "tunnel of pure sound" is particularly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The story avoids major artifacts like loops or scaffolding. However, there is a slight tendency toward summarizing key realizations, such as "He was fetching wisdom not from the failure of the machine, but from the failure of the man he had been," which tells rather than purely showing the dawning insight.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative, creating a rich texture that mirrors the story's themes. The piece avoids nearly all line-level artifacts; sentences are varied, rhythmically controlled, and carry significant weight. While the style is highly elevated, it rarely feels overwritten, instead contributing to the story’s powerful, epic atmosphere and maintaining clarity even in its most complex descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and imagistically rich, with a strong, confident rhythm. However, a few key moments lean slightly into abstraction or thematic summary where a more concrete rendering would be even more powerful (e.g., "physics not breaking but choosing to play a new, more beautiful game"). While beautifully phrased, these instances slightly reduce the information density by telling the reader the meaning of the event rather than letting the image do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and vivid sensory details ("bleed from the strings," "a sound like a mountain sighing"). Momentum is well-maintained. A few instances of abstract assertion ("Elara’s time was the gap between knowing and understanding") and slight scaffolding ("This was her method, her secret") prevent a higher score by momentarily telling what could be purely shown.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally demonstrates high information density. However, there are a few instances of thematic summary that read like telling rather than showing ("His motivation was singular...", "He believed that by linking absences..."). While well-phrased, these sentences summarize internal processes that are already being effectively dramatized by the scene's action. This slightly interrupts the momentum and immediacy of an otherwise immaculately crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is evocative and clean for the most part, with strong verbs and specific imagery. Momentum is occasionally slowed by sentences that summarize an internal realization instead of dramatizing it. The line "Elara understood then that her wrong turn had been no accident" is a notable instance of telling that slightly flattens a key moment of insight just before the closure, preventing the prose from achieving flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and carries a high information density without feeling overwritten. Sentences are crafted for rhythmic effect and clarity, especially in the challenging passages describing non-Euclidean space. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding; every word serves to advance the story's atmosphere, character, or conceptual development.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, rhythmic control, and evocative, precise language. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought figurative passages; every sentence propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere. The prose is clean and luminous, serving as a perfect vehicle for the story's content.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, with a strong rhythm and evocative word choice. However, there is a slight tendency towards dense, abstract phrasing ("hush of cosmic possibility," "certainty of a task complete") that occasionally verges on overwriting. The line "It was a symphony, a theory, a poem, a revolution—all at once" is a moment of telling at a climactic beat, slightly diminishing the power of the image.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and precise, particularly in its description of the underwater scene ("a cathedral of greenish light and drifting fronds"). Information density is high, with few wasted words. The primary weakness is in the final memory-return paragraph, which shifts from showing to a highly compressed summary ("She saw... She saw..."). While efficient, this telling of the climactic moment lessens its visceral impact compared to the vivid sensory detail of the discovery phase.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. However, the explanation of the tea leaves ("The leaves are a map of probabilities, a fluid geometry...") reads as a block of exposition that slightly stalls momentum. While necessary for the world's logic, its delivery is less integrated into action than other elements, feeling more like a told rule-set. The rest of the piece demonstrates strong syntactic variety and concision.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong rhythm and sentence variety. Information density is high, particularly in the opening paragraph. While generally excellent, a few phrases rely on familiar constructions ("melancholy settled in Elara’s bones," "despair clawed at her") that slightly soften the otherwise sharp and specific language. The piece is clean and propulsive, with no significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with exceptional moments like "a silence woven from the breath of the dead." However, a few minor imperfections slightly mar the otherwise flawless surface. A grammatical slip ("a anxious energy") and a slightly less potent phrasing ("seeming to flicker") are small but notable in a piece striving for this level of polish.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in most sentences. Phrasing like "a never-ending sigh" and "resonant quiet" demonstrates strong command of language. However, there are minor moments where the prose could be tighter, such as the slightly abstract description of a smell as "profound stillness." These are hairline imperfections in a piece that is otherwise polished to a very high standard and maintains clear momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and evocative for the most part, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, the final two paragraphs contain minor scaffolding that slightly dulls the closure's impact. Phrases like "Elara finally understood" and the direct thematic summary from Mortimer constitute strategic telling that verges on summarizing the story's point, a small but noticeable flaw in an otherwise very strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and generally strong, but held back by minor flaws. Phrasing like "her fingers danced" is a familiar trope, and the repetition of "tinkersong wonder," while thematic, slightly dulls its impact. The sentence-level craft is mostly excellent, but these small instances of conventional phrasing prevent it from reaching the highest tier of flawlessness, particularly for a story aiming for this level of literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery ("Braille for the eyes," "a thousand tiny rainbows"). The piece avoids major artifacts, but a few instances of summary-in-place-of-scene prevent a higher score. Lines like "The narrative continued to unfold" and "his heart was now pledged to the old one's unfinished work" are efficient but slightly blunt instruments in an otherwise subtle work.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and highly efficient, with nearly every sentence doing double duty for atmosphere and character. The language is consistently elevated yet clear, avoiding overwritten passages even in its most poetic moments ("The silence that followed was quietly explosive"). There are no discernible loops or scaffolding; the read-aloud quality is superb, and the rhythm of the sentences propels the quiet narrative forward with an inexorable, gentle momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with high information density in nearly every line. There are no wasted words, and the rhythm of the sentences expertly matches the story's shifting pace. A minor repetition of the phrase "fractally precise" and a moment of telling emotion ("Frustration, a rare visitor...") are the only hairline imperfections in an otherwise masterfully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean and often evocative. However, the final paragraph contains a clear paraphrase loop that dulls the impact of the closure. The line "she had discovered a new language of power" is immediately restated as "she would chart the unseen geographies of energy and resonance." This redundancy at a critical moment is a significant flaw, summarizing a realization that the preceding events had already dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, with nearly every sentence contributing to atmosphere, character, or plot. Word choice is consistently strong and specific ("quicksilver ripple," "seismic alignment"), and the syntax is varied to create a compelling rhythm. There are no technical flaws, loops, or overwriting artifacts that obscure clarity, resulting in a seamless and immersive read.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, elegant, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the story's elegiac tone without becoming overwrought. While a few figurative phrases verge on being slightly ornate (e.g., "her hope a brambled thing"), the line-level execution is largely free of artifacts, loops, or scaffolding, resulting in a smooth and immersive read.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lyrical and demonstrates high information density. The language is ambitious and mostly successful, creating vivid, memorable images. The score is slightly tempered by minor thematic redundancy in the final paragraph, where phrases like "beautiful flaw of existence" echo earlier constructions, slightly dulling the impact of an otherwise powerful closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and efficient, with high information density and strong verbs. The opening paragraph is particularly effective, establishing character, setting, and conflict with concise, evocative language. While the line-level craft is very strong, a few moments verge on being slightly overwritten with figurative language, though it never obscures clarity or momentum enough to be a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, clear, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its use of character-specific metaphors. The rhythm is controlled and effective, propelling the internal narrative forward. A minor weakness is a slight tendency toward paraphrase loops in the final two paragraphs, where the same realization is rephrased multiple times, slightly dulling the momentum of an otherwise sharp conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and polished, demonstrating high information density without a single wasted word or awkward construction. The density of figurative language ("ghost held together by a promise," "voice the sound of pages turning") feels earned and integral to the world's atmosphere, not ornamental. The piece is free of loops, scaffolding, or other line-level artifacts, showcasing exceptional craft and control.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and demonstrates exceptional control. Sentences are crafted for rhythmic and atmospheric effect, such as, "The air itself felt sturdy brittle, like old glass." While the figurative language is consistently strong and tied to the chef conceit, a few moments verge on being slightly overwrought (e.g., the "complex broth"). However, these are matters of taste in an otherwise immaculate and propulsive line-level execution with zero technical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with high information density in its descriptions. However, there is a recurring tendency toward overwriting, with a very high density of figurative language that can feel overwrought. Phrases like "hush of borrowed starlight" and the repetition of "vigorous tender" create a slightly precious texture that, while consistent, occasionally slows the momentum by drawing attention to its own lyricism at the expense of propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a few instances of telling weaken the overall craft. Phrases like "This was her period of profound transformation" and the final "The transformation was complete" function as scaffolding, summarizing states that the narrative otherwise powerfully dramatizes, slightly dulling an otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, clear, and demonstrates strong momentum, especially during the entry and escape sequences. Word choice is generally precise, though a few phrases like "latent blaze of potential energy" lean toward generic description. The sentence structure varies effectively to match the pacing, creating a propulsive and readable narrative with no significant line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and clean, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are well-paced, building momentum toward the climax. The piece loses a fraction of a point for a few instances of overwriting in key moments, such as the slightly clumsy oxymoron "intensely quiet crescendo," which pulls back from the otherwise pristine execution.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, controlled, and demonstrates high information density with a strong, lyrical rhythm. Word choice is precise and evocative ("voice thin as dust," "frantic jig"). A few moments of insight are slightly over-articulated ("she saw not chaos, but desperation"), summarizing the meaning rather than letting the image do the work, a minor artifact that keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, with strong sensory details and varied sentence structures. The story’s momentum is well-paced. Minor deductions are for a few small artifacts: the repetition of "theatrical sincerity," a slightly redundant phrase pair ("profound and earnest gravity"), and the aforementioned cliché. These are small blemishes on an otherwise polished piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, with strong verbs and a varied, musical rhythm. However, several moments lean towards telling rather than showing the character's realization, particularly in the final paragraph ("She understood the lesson," "Elora understood its truth"). While the craft is largely excellent, these moments of authorial explanation act as minor scaffolding that slightly lessens the impact of the otherwise powerful climax.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery like "a library of quiet." However, the two paragraphs of explicit realization ("The resilience wasn't in the soil... an event..." followed by "Elara understood... The resilience was the echo itself...") create a slight momentum drag. This moment of telling, where showing would have been more powerful, is the story's most significant line-level flaw, slightly dulling an otherwise sharp climax.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and dense with purpose. Sentence structure is varied, and the rhythm builds momentum effectively toward the climax. While a few phrases verge on being slightly overwritten (e.g., "chaotic symphony of pressure and suction"), the overall craft is very strong, with specific, powerful verbs and concrete imagery driving the narrative forward without unnecessary scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, strong verbs, and purposeful figurative language. The prose is lush yet clear, with varied sentence structures that control pace effectively, particularly in the lead-up to the climax and its immediate aftermath ("The note struck. For a heartbeat, nothing."). There are no notable prose artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. Phrases like "avalanchingly quiet pressure" and "curtain of cold silk" are memorable and effective. The piece is nearly flawless, but a few functional, slightly procedural phrases ("Her task complete," "a mindless thing") momentarily flatten the otherwise superb texture, keeping it just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and frequently stunning, with high information density and evocative imagery. Sentences are well-crafted and the rhythm supports the story's tone. The piece avoids major artifacts like loops or redundancy. The only minor weakness is a tendency towards a very deliberate, almost overwrought lyricism in a few places ("a singular, lucid turbulence"), which can feel more authorial than character-bound, momentarily thinning the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density. However, a few lines drift towards telling in moments of high revelation. The sentence, "The pendant was not a delivery; it was a key," followed by an explanation of its function, slightly flattens the discovery. This minor tendency to summarize an insight rather than letting the image do all the work is the only element holding the prose back from true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant and highly effective, with strong, specific word choice and a varied, pleasing rhythm. The density of figurative language is high but remains purposeful, serving character and theme without becoming overwrought. The piece is remarkably clean, with no distracting loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony, resulting in a polished and professional execution at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose contains many luminous phrases ("fossilized against the relentless flow of ages"). However, there is a consistent pattern of overwriting, with a high density of adjectives and adverbs that occasionally slows the momentum ("stoically sparkling," "thin, miraculous strand," "profound, healing quiet"). The repetition of "stoically sparkling" and the slightly awkward metaphor "hush of time's unraveling tapestry" are noticeable artifacts in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, elegant, and generally possesses high information density. However, a few moments detract from an otherwise flawless execution. The phrase "The cavern held its breath" is a stock cliché that feels out of place in such specific prose. Similarly, the final sentence ("She had coaxed resilience from rubble, not with noise, but with a meek blacksmith’s quiet, unbreakable will") functions as a thematic summary that slightly undermines the power of the preceding image.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, clear, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. Word choice is largely precise and evocative. There is a slight, noticeable repetition of key words like "weight" and "withheld truth" that borders on a conceptual loop, though it could be argued as a motif. The primary flaw is the final sentence, which feels overwritten and less potent than the image of the sigil it follows, slightly dulling the sharpness of the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with a strong, rhythmic cadence. The line-level craft is mostly excellent, particularly in its sensory details. However, a few moments verge on overwriting, such as the near-synonym pairing of "luminescent ache" and a "sorrow that glowed," which creates a minor conceptual loop. The final paragraph's declarative summary slightly dilutes the power of the preceding actions, telling what was already effectively shown.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. The opening sentence is a masterclass in establishing character, setting, and tone. While the line-level craft is generally excellent, a few abstract emotional labels ("shadowed elation," "dread-tinged thrill") feel slightly less concrete than the surrounding physical descriptions, and the final paragraph leans toward summary over pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, with high information density and striking imagery, especially in the first half. Phrases like "iridescent caution a silent sermon" are memorable and effective. There is a slight tendency towards overwriting in the final paragraphs, where abstract summary ("It was not a memory, but an understanding, a quiet explosion of empathy") slightly dulls the immediacy of the preceding physical action and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong, evocative imagery like “7.3 grays of sorrow.” There is a minor repetition in the opening paragraph (“quiet, measured” used for both his days and his sorrow) that could be refined. The final paragraph veers slightly into telling over showing, summarizing his new role rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is impeccable, demonstrating high information density and sentence-level propulsion. Word choices are precise and evocative (e.g., “guttered out,” “specific gravity of sunlight on dew”). The prose is lush without becoming overwritten, and there are no instances of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts; every sentence contributes to the story's texture and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with high information density in most sentences. There are moments of exceptional craft, like "her solitude a well-worn cloak she preferred to the world's abrasive textures." The score is held back from the 9+ band by a few minor artifacts, such as a paraphrase loop ("The silence was not empty, but full, a listening silence") and a slightly overwrought metaphor ("a wave of cognitive frost") that momentarily break the otherwise seamless texture.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a few phrases like "heuristically gentle" and "a tenuous absolution, a fragile forgiveness" represent a register drift into abstract, academic language that momentarily breaks from the story's grounded, sensory texture. While isolated, these moments are noticeable blemishes on an otherwise impeccable surface.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and largely excellent, with high information density in its descriptions. There is a minor, brief run of "He [verb]..." sentence structures in the third paragraph, but it's contained and arguably reflects the character's procedural mindset. The figurative language ("cathedral of ice," "bruise healing into yellow") is strong and integrated. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no notable artifacts to disrupt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely excellent, with powerful lines like "a metallic sigh of betrayal." However, a moment in the climax—"He hadn’t broken it; its steadfastness had been violated"—verges on telling the reader Silas's internal state rather than letting his expression carry the full weight. This is a minor slip in an otherwise impeccable piece, but it slightly abstracts an otherwise perfectly embodied moment.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and inventive, particularly in its rendering of synesthetic experience ("sweet and dusty like jam left in a sunlit attic"). Sentences are well-crafted with strong rhythm and momentum. A few phrases, like "terrestrially cosmic display," lean toward high-concept abstraction where a more concrete image might have landed with greater force, a minor blemish on an otherwise stellar piece.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there are minor instances of scaffolding and near-redundancy that could be tightened for greater momentum (e.g., "A sudden, inexplicable pull, an inescapable calling"). The final paragraph occasionally slips into summarizing the thematic resolution ("The suppressed creativity was not just uncorked; it was transformed") instead of letting the action of drawing carry the full weight of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and precise, with strong sensory details and varied sentence structures. However, momentum is slightly undercut by a few instances of telling over showing. Lines like "The method was clear; she would have to proceed by..." and "This was the opposite of the grand deceptions..." read like scaffolding or authorial summary rather than organic thought, momentarily flattening the prose and pulling the reader out of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery that carry the story's emotional weight. Sentences are well-crafted and rhythmically varied, creating a smooth and immersive read. A minor instance of a paraphrase loop ("muted vigor, a quiet, determined energy") slightly detracts from the otherwise pristine line-level craft, but the overall quality is very high and free of significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and vivid, specific imagery ("a contained star of anguish"). The rhythm and syntax support the story's mounting tension and the android's evolving state of mind. A single weak point is the use of a slightly worn metaphor ("pieces of a vase glued back together") in the final paragraph, a minor flaw in an otherwise impeccable execution.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally well-paced, with strong sensory details like the "sandstorm calm." However, some phrases lean towards abstraction where concreteness is needed, such as the lock being "strengthened by witness." The final sentence is a prose-level flaw, functioning as a summary that flattens the resonance of the final image. These minor issues prevent the prose from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally polished, clear, and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative. The primary weakness is a minor tendency toward over-explanation in key moments, such as when her dance is described as "a living diagram, translating...sorrow into motion," which summarizes the metaphor rather than allowing the image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in its imagery ("hands like worn rope," "papery ghost of a moment"). The sentence and paragraph structure create a deliberate, somber rhythm that supports the story's atmosphere. There are no technical flaws, though the final two paragraphs shift into a slightly more declarative mode to deliver the conclusion, a minor deviation from the otherwise consistently imagistic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and powerful, original figurative language ("tranquil blaze," "a peace so intense it was luminous"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to the atmosphere and momentum. It is a piece that demonstrates immense control at the line level, with its rhythm and word choice perfectly calibrated to its conceptual aims.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, evocative figurative language, and a compelling rhythm. The prose is clean, with no discernible scaffolding, loops, or overwriting. Every sentence works to advance the story's atmosphere and momentum with remarkable precision and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose contains moments of beauty and precision, but is hampered by the same abstract jargon that affects the voice. The final paragraph verges on a conceptual loop, restating the outcome in different abstract terms, which dulls the impact of an otherwise strong and quiet closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong rhythm and precise word choice. However, the line "She worked with a focus that was wisely enduring" is a clear prose artifact, inserting a provided key term as a label rather than dramatizing the quality. This momentary lapse, occurring in the final third, is a notable flaw in an otherwise polished piece and prevents the story from reaching the highest tier of execution.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong verbs and evocative, specific imagery ("reed-blown melancholy," "a negative of its sun-bleached daytime self"). The sentences have a varied, lyrical rhythm that propels the narrative without drawing undue attention to itself. The writing is dense and purposeful, with no significant scaffolding, loops, or wasted words.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally demonstrates strong line-level craft with good rhythm and clarity. The piece is weakened by a few instances of conceptual summary where concrete action would be stronger, such as labeling the snow globe a "metaphor." While there are no egregious prose artifacts, these moments of telling over showing slightly reduce the overall momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density. Sentences are crafted with a poet's ear for rhythm and specificity ("a cool, damp blanket of mist bejeweled with a thousand prismatic droplets"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding. The repetition of "scintillatingly somber" works as a deliberate framing device, enhancing the story's ritualistic, meditative quality rather than feeling redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely excellent, with strong imagery like "crunched on vitrified soil." However, a few minor instances of telling over showing ("Kaelen knew better," "a deliberate act of obfuscation") and slight redundancy ("a singular, driving force") represent hairline flaws. These moments are brief and do not derail momentum, but they prevent the prose from reaching flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with very few wasted words. Sentences are constructed with rhythmic variety and a strong ear for poetic effect ("fractured the lightning into sapphire shards"). While the register is consistently high, it avoids feeling overwrought, instead building a cohesive and immersive atmosphere. It is free of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with high information density in every line. Sentences are constructed with a poet's ear for rhythm and cadence, creating momentum without a single wasted word. There are no notable loops or scaffolding; figurative language is fresh and integrated. The description of the symphony—“The foghorn’s moan became a foundational cello note, the birds’ chatter a skittering flute line”—is clear, imaginative, and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, particularly in the opening and the action sequence. Sentences are well-crafted and propel the narrative forward. The piece is held back slightly by abstract descriptions of the resolution ("dissolved into harmless warmth") and the thematic statements in the final sentences, which feel less concrete than the sharp prose preceding them.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, precise imagery, and a compelling rhythm. Sentences like "He had to unyoke his spirit from the frantic tempo of desire and bind it to the slow, sure rhythm of the cosmos" are both beautiful and functionally critical. The prose is entirely free of artifacts, exhibiting a polish and confidence that elevates the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and propulsive. While mostly excellent, there are minor artifacts, such as the template construction of "The investigator in her... The woman in her," and the slightly abstract label "fortified vulnerability," which momentarily lessen the otherwise sharp immediacy of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, clear, and often lyrical, with a high information density and strong sentence-level propulsion. The opening and closing paragraphs are particularly effective. The score is held back only by a single awkward construction—"the method by the way light breaks through storm clouds"—which feels abstract and slightly jarring in an otherwise concrete and sensory scene.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and rhythmically controlled. However, a few phrases lean heavily into high-concept abstraction ("transliterate the language of change itself," "world’s shifting DNA") which, while consistent with the voice, slightly dampens the otherwise excellent momentum in those specific lines. This is a hairline issue in an otherwise masterfully executed piece.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, concise, and propulsive. Figurative language, like the archive as a "mausoleum" and the data leak as a "supernova," is generally effective and well-integrated. The piece is slightly weakened by a few cliché phrases in the final moments, such as the truth's "roar that echoed through the halls of power," which feels less specific and crafted than the story's strong opening.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there are a few moments where the story defaults to summary or abstract labels at key junctures, particularly when establishing motivation ("Her motivation, a deep-seated need..."). While the line-level execution is mostly sharp, these instances of scaffolding slightly dull the propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional and ready for publication. The prose exhibits high information density, with fresh, coherent metaphors and a varied, compelling rhythm that supports the contemplative tone. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; every word is chosen with care and contributes to the story's powerful effect.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is largely elegant, with a strong rhythmic control. However, a few phrases like "nurture intersubjective understanding" and "passionate subtlety" are jarring text artifacts, a register drift into academic jargon that momentarily breaks the lyrical spell. While the figurative language is dense, it is mostly coherent and effective. These isolated but noticeable flaws in word choice prevent an otherwise excellent prose performance from scoring higher.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery that build a tangible world. However, a few moments rely on abstract labels that tell rather than show (e.g., "a visual representation of a profound and final truth"). There is also a minor repetitive sentence stem ("It was a..."), a small scaffold that slightly dulls the propulsion in the first half. These are minor flaws in otherwise polished and confident line-level craft, but they prevent a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery. However, there are moments of overwriting and conceptual redundancy, especially in the final paragraphs. The central theme of healing and transmutation is restated multiple times in slightly different phrasing, creating a loop that dulls the momentum and impact of the otherwise powerful final image. This replaces propulsion with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and highly crafted, with strong, evocative imagery ("a tombstone for a language," "sanded down by the relentless silence"). The rhythm and sentence structure support the story's quiet, deliberate momentum. While the figurative language is dense, it largely avoids feeling overwritten and contributes to the atmosphere, though a few phrases verge on abstraction without immediate concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lyrical and precise for most of the story, with many memorable phrases. However, a significant text artifact—the Chinese character `全部` in the line "before it was全部 gone"—occurs at a moment of peak tension. For a publication of this caliber, such an error is a critical flaw that shatters immersion and suggests a lack of final polish, heavily impacting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("a silent tomb hurled into the sunless deep"). However, a few minor artifacts slightly dull the effect. Phrases like "restructure her understanding of the problem immediately" are overly abstract, and "a wave of calm" is a familiar cliché. These moments are brief but prevent the line-level craft from reaching perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative for the most part. However, a few lines veer slightly into over-explanation, telling the reader what is already being shown. For instance, "She was not recreating a perfect performance; she was hymning the mundane miracle..." summarizes the theme a bit too neatly. This minor tendency to state its own mechanics, while not severely damaging, prevents the prose from achieving absolute flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative ("gritty, metallic sigh"), and the sentence structure varies to control rhythm effectively. Figurative language, like the spoon that "writhed like a silver eel," is fresh and vivid without ever feeling overwritten. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no wasted words or distracting prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. There is, however, a minor tendency toward abstract conceptual phrasing that can feel slightly overwritten, such as "nostalgic innovation" or the heavily thematic language in the final paragraph. This intellectual gloss occasionally stands out from the more grounded, emotional prose surrounding it.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("flowed over the dark, wet stone like liquid emerald"). Momentum is well-paced for a contemplative piece. A minor deduction is warranted for a few instances of overwriting, such as the "zephyr bloom tone" passage, which momentarily sacrifices concision for excessive figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its descriptive passages ("glistening, ephemeral map... a complex and fleeting algorithm of meltwater"). However, a few select phrases feel slightly overwrought or like prompt residue ("watchful dreamer," "quietly proactive diligence"). The repetition of "honeyed hush" is a minor but noticeable artifact that slightly dulls the otherwise pristine surface of the craft.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and controlled. Sentence structure and rhythm vary to match the emotional cadence of the scene, moving from watchful stillness to the rush of memory. Word choice is precise and evocative ("feral nexus," "swirling hush") without tipping into overwriting. The piece is remarkably clean, with no discernible loops, scaffolding, or rhythmic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong, with clear, evocative prose and good syntactic variety. Momentum is well-maintained. The piece is held back from the highest tier by a handful of phrases that lean into familiar fantasy conventions ("impending change," "ached in her bones," "latent energy"), which slightly soften the specificity of an otherwise sharp and textured narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional, with high information density and a distinct, evocative rhythm. Word choice is precise and powerful ("spectral anatomy," "liquid mercury," "sublimated into the image"), creating a vivid texture without a single instance of overwriting. There are no loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles; every sentence propels the story's atmospheric and narrative goals with concision and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density. The sentence structure and rhythm are controlled and evocative. A minor deduction is warranted for a few instances of adjective stacking in key moments, such as the "rich, profound, and beautiful echo," where a more concrete image might have had even greater impact. This is a hairline slip in an otherwise masterfully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished to a high sheen, with immense information density and rhythmic control. Nearly every sentence serves character, atmosphere, and momentum simultaneously. A minor conceptual repetition ("She was the archive, and the archive was her") is the only element that feels slightly less sharp, a hairline imperfection in an otherwise flawless line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with very few wasted words. The sentence structure is varied, and the imagery is consistently strong and purposeful ("a ton of muscle and tooth paced a breath away"). A few moments feel slightly repetitive in their phrasing, such as the back-to-back sentences stating her "task" and "motivation" in the opening paragraph, but these are minor issues in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong, evocative imagery and varied sentence rhythms that support the story's momentum. The language demonstrates high information density and avoids cliché. The score is slightly tempered by a few sentences that lean toward summarizing the emotional arc rather than embodying it, as seen in the phrasing "Her regret softened, not disappearing, but transforming into a dull, useful tool," which feels more analytical than experiential in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is generally functional but contains a critical flaw that makes it unacceptable for publication. The phrase "a 清晰的 flowchart" is a text artifact that breaks the story's coherence and suggests a technical error in the writing process. Additionally, there are minor issues of overwriting and repetition, such as "fractured through the fractured dome glass," which dull the precision of the language.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and propulsive, with high information density in nearly every sentence. Figurative language, such as "a cavern of ticking and tocks," is effective and integrated. While the lyricism is mostly controlled, a few phrases like "condensed history and forgotten promises" lean slightly toward abstraction, a hairline slip in an otherwise masterfully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is overwhelmingly lyrical and precise, with strong verbs and vivid imagery. However, a significant line-level artifact appears at a pivotal moment: "The attribute of the revelation was thoughtfully clear." This abstract, clunky phrase breaks the established voice and interrupts the story’s otherwise seamless flow, momentarily dulling the impact of the climax. While most of the writing is exceptional, this flaw is too prominent to ignore.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, concise, and evocative, with high information density in nearly every sentence. The rhythm is controlled, mirroring the story's quiet, deliberate pace, and the imagery is both beautiful and functional ("a fragile, lightning-born root of sand"). The piece is free of line-level artifacts, loops, or overwriting; every word serves to build atmosphere, character, or momentum toward the central revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.9)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: precise, evocative, and rhythmically controlled. Every sentence is load-bearing, contributing to character, atmosphere, and momentum without a single wasted word or cliché. Figurative language, such as Isolde's voice being "the sound of dry leaves skittering on stone," is fresh and effective. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; the clarity and information density, especially in the climactic sensory flood, are flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, clear, and evocative, with high information density in nearly every sentence. Word choice is precise, and the sentence structure varies to match the pacing of the narrative, from the meticulous assembly to the climactic awakening. The story is almost entirely free of line-level artifacts; the only minor weakness is the thematic summary in the final paragraph, which feels slightly less crafted than the potent imagery that precedes it. Overall, the craft is exceptionally clean and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and evocative imagery. Sentences are beautifully constructed, creating a strong, meditative rhythm. A minor deduction is warranted for a few instances of abstract summary that dilute the otherwise concrete prose, such as, "Her compassion was not soft; it was a stubborn, active force," which tells the reader something the actions are already demonstrating more effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, with high information density and strong rhythm. The word choice is precise and evocative. A few character descriptors ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative") feel slightly like authorial labels rather than emerging purely from the prose, a minor artifact that keeps it from the 9+ band, but overall the line-level craft is superb.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with not a wasted word. Figurative language is rich but never overwrought, serving to build the world and Elara's internal state simultaneously. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no line-level artifacts, loops, or scaffolding to impede its momentum, resulting in a polished, professional finish.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is often luminous but is held back by minor, recurring flaws. The key phrase "thundering calm" is repeated, functioning as a thematic shortcut rather than allowing the feeling to emerge from different descriptions. There is also a slight over-reliance on abstract emotional nouns ("unspoken histories," "silent sorrow," "profound and settled peace") that, while fitting the tone, occasionally feel less concrete and impactful than the story's strongest sensory images.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is consistently precise and evocative, with figurative language that enhances atmosphere without becoming overwrought ("a dark mirror under a bruised sky"). There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; every sentence serves a clear purpose in advancing character, setting, or action. The rhythm and syntax vary to match the story's pacing, culminating in a final paragraph of profound, declarative stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    While often beautiful, the prose falters at the climax. The revelation arrives via "a transmission of pure meaning directly into her mind," a tell-not-show shortcut that summarizes the epiphany rather than dramatizing it. This moment of abstract exposition lessens the impact of the discovery, feeling more like a data transfer than a deeply felt realization.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. However, a few lines drift towards thematic summary, slightly undermining the principle of showing over telling. For instance, "sustaining transformation not as a triumphant fanfare, but as a low, steady hum" explicitly names the tone. While effective, a top-tier editor would likely tighten these moments to let the effect exist purely in the action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are constructed with care, varying in length and structure to match the story's quiet, deliberate pacing. While the figurative language is rich, it rarely feels excessive, instead serving to build the story's unique atmosphere. The final paragraph provides a clean, powerful cadence that brings the narrative to a satisfying close.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and clear, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are constructed with a jeweller's care, particularly in the description of the artistic process. The score is held back slightly by the same issue noted in Theme: a few sentences in the resolution stray into direct summary, a minor scaffolding that lessens the impact of the otherwise flawless scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is a significant strength, marked by high information density, clarity, and evocative imagery. Phrases like "sedimentary layers of silt and forgotten history" and "sand down her certainty" demonstrate a high level of craft. There are no loops, scaffold phrases, or overwritten passages; every sentence propels the narrative forward with concision and a strong, rhythmic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is superb. The prose is both beautiful and economical, with high information density in every sentence. Word choice is precise and evocative (e.g., "thrum of discord," "rustle of aged paper"). There are no wasted words, awkward constructions, or overwrought figurative language, resulting in a clean, propulsive, and highly polished narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong imagery like the greenhouse's "iron skeleton weeping orange tears." However, there are minor but noticeable artifacts that slightly dull the momentum. The pruning sequence uses a repetitive sentence structure ("With each precise cut... With every snip...") that feels more like a template than organic prose, and a few instances of list-like phrasing slightly flatten the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is often evocative and polished, with strong opening imagery ("bruised amber bleeding into violet"). Sentences are clear and propel the narrative forward. There are a few instances of familiar phrasing ("words tasting like ash," "heart soaring") that slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution. The final paragraph feels slightly summary-like, spelling out the thematic resolution rather than letting the final image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most lines. The rhythm and syntax support the contemplative mood effectively. There are minor instances of near-redundancy that could be tightened for maximum impact, such as "sanctifying a moment, making it holy and permanent," where the latter half paraphrases the former. These are small frictions in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and often luminous, but a noticeable artifact dulls a crucial transitional moment. The sentence, "The tone animate lifeless of the garden shifted..." contains awkward syntax ("animate lifeless") that disrupts the rhythm and clarity just before the climax resolves. While the rest of the piece is polished, this line-level flaw in such a pivotal spot prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in most lines. The opening and closing sentences are particularly strong, anchoring the story's concept and resolution effectively. A minor deduction is warranted for a few sentences that summarize the thematic implication ("The equations had not been a key... but a seed..."), slightly diluting the otherwise powerful 'show, don't tell' execution of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong, evocative imagery. However, there is a tendency toward overwriting in places, with a high density of figurative language that occasionally slows momentum (e.g., "a vast and stubbornly blank canvas, stood accused by a palette of dried paints"). While there are no major artifacts, a lighter touch would elevate the craft further.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and confident, marked by strong, evocative imagery like "the sound of a culture starving" and "rosewater dread." The rhythm and sentence structure vary effectively, supporting the story's momentum. There is a slight, occasional tendency towards adjectival density ("cloying, sentimental sorrow... sharp, metallic fear") that borders on overwriting, but these moments are infrequent and do not detract from the clarity or impact of the pivotal beats. The piece is polished and demonstrates high-level craft with no technical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and powerful, specific imagery. Sentences like "It was not a light that shone upon something, but a light that was something" demonstrate a mastery of conceptual description. While a few phrases verge on the familiar ("heart hammering"), they are embedded in such a strong and original context that they do little to detract from the overall momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and propulsive, with strong verbs and evocative figurative language ("a symphony of repulsive allure," "a shattered heart"). There is a high information density per line without feeling overwritten. A few phrases verge on the familiar ("dust motes dancing"), but the overall craft is sharp and free of loops or significant artifacts, driving the narrative with clarity and confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. However, the figurative language is so consistently dense ("bruised, fractious clouds," "amorphous indigo," "restless euphony") that it risks becoming overwrought, slightly impeding momentum. The final paragraph contains a minor thematic summary ("Its chaos had been given order...") which is a small but notable flaw in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often lyrical, with strong imagery like the "weeping wound" of rust. The pacing is well-managed through varied sentence structure and paragraphing. There are no significant prose artifacts or loops. The piece is held back from a higher score only by a few instances of summary in the final paragraph where a more concrete, imagistic rendering would have been more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, clear, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, particularly in the opening paragraph. Word choice is precise and the piece is free of line-level artifacts like loops or overwritten passages. The information density is high, with every sentence serving a clear purpose. The writing is polished and professional, achieving its aims with an admirable economy.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a high density of purposeful imagery. The rhythm of the sentences effectively mirrors the character's deliberate pace and later, his emotional turmoil. A minor penalty is applied for a slight conceptual loop with the repeated use of “wrest” to describe his motivation in two consecutive paragraphs, which slightly flattens the momentum in that section. Otherwise, the line-level craft is superb.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, economical, and evocative. Word choices like "velvet silence," "dappled resolve," and "palimpsest" are precise and purposeful, achieving high information density without feeling overwritten. There are no wasted sentences or distracting prose artifacts; every line serves to advance character, atmosphere, or plot. The sentence and paragraph structures create a rhythm that mirrors the story's quiet, deliberate pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is clean, concise, and rhythmically sophisticated. Figurative language, such as the memory becoming "stained-glass beautiful," is both original and precise, doing significant work to advance theme and atmosphere. The piece is free of loops or artifacts; even the repetition of "descend while ascending" is a deliberate, powerful structural choice that connects setting to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—dense, lyrical, and precise from the first sentence to the last. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful ("a title that was a tombstone"). The rhythm and syntax are controlled with a confidence that builds momentum and supports the story's grave, focused tone, with no evidence of scaffolding or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery in the opening and setting descriptions. However, a few moments rely on common phrasing ("fingers danced," "heart hammered against her ribs") that slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution. The language describing the final consciousness-altering event leans more abstract than concretely sensory, missing an opportunity for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—polished, lyrical, and concise. Information density is high, with sentences like "Her own guilt was the loom upon which she built these beautiful lies for others" doing significant character and thematic work. There is no overwriting, scaffolding, or repetitive phrasing; every word feels deliberately chosen to advance the story’s atmosphere and meaning. The rhythm and clarity are maintained even in moments of high internal pressure, demonstrating remarkable craft.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and often powerful, particularly in its imagery. However, a few phrases drift toward abstraction or thematic summary where a more concrete image would be stronger (e.g., "recycle mistakes into wisdom," "its toxic energy neutralized"). While minor, these moments slightly soften the otherwise impeccable line-level craft, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Figurative language, such as "a man chasing electricity because he had lost his own," is consistently fresh and purposeful. The line-level craft is nearly flawless, with a minor deduction for a slightly explanatory sentence ("It wasn't a physical weight, but a psychic one...") that precedes a more effective dramatization of the same idea.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, concise, and often elegant, with high information density in its descriptions ("a clean slate that felt less like a fresh start and more like an erasure"). There is a strong command of rhythm and syntax, creating momentum without overwriting. The language is precise and evocative, avoiding clichés and demonstrating a read-aloud quality with no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with high information density. However, there are minor artifacts that prevent a top-tier score. The phrase "paradoxically steady" is repeated, a noticeable echo in a piece this short. Some abstract phrasing like "a reluctant metamorphosis of reality itself" and "cosmic intimacy" could be more grounded, though they do serve the story's tone. These are minor frictions in an otherwise polished and propulsive piece.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery that carry the story's emotional weight. The rhythm is controlled, modulating well between description and the rising intensity of the ritual. The only slight weakness is in the final paragraph, which has a slightly summary quality, briefly slowing the momentum by restating what the climax had already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, momentum is occasionally slowed by minor conceptual redundancies in the second paragraph, where the nature of the sorrow is described in several consecutive sentences. A few phrases, like "a physiological truth the ship's systems mirrored," are overly clinical and break the otherwise ghostly, lyrical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean and often evocative, but it suffers from moments of conceptual overwriting and redundancy. The final paragraphs contain several paraphrase loops where the same epiphany is re-stated in slightly different terms ("She was not orchestrating coincidences; she was one... Her philanthropy had never been about the money..."). This scaffolding dulls the momentum and impact of the otherwise strong closure scene.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is clean, dense, and propulsive. The opening sentence, "The twilight was not a dimming but a deepening," immediately establishes a high level of craft. Word choice is precise and evocative ("ironoak," "sun-stones"), building the world with economy. There are no discernible prose artifacts like loops or scaffolding; every sentence serves a purpose in advancing the narrative or enriching the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is exceptional: dense, precise, and evocative. Every sentence works to advance the story, with no wasted words or scaffolding. The figurative language is fresh and integrated, such as the aurora being a "silent river" or the star dust being a "paradoxical grain of infinite density and weightless hope." The piece passes the read-aloud test with a varied, compelling rhythm, and is entirely free of the loops or artifacts that plague lesser prose.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with virtually no wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language is rich but purposeful, consistently serving character and theme, as in "a seed cast onto fertile lightning." The sentence structure is varied, creating a rhythm that modulates with the internal and external tempest. The piece is exceptionally clean and demonstrates a high level of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, clear, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, the final paragraph contains several sentences that restate the thematic resolution, acting as scaffolding that dulls the impact of the final image. This paraphrasing loop at the very end prevents an otherwise exemplary piece of prose from achieving a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant and efficient, with a strong, varied rhythm. Information density is high, with imagery doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. While a couple of phrases lean towards cliché ("panic rising like a tide"), the overall execution is sharp, clear, and free of distracting artifacts. The reprise of "luminous fracture" is a particularly effective structural and stylistic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense with vivid, purposeful imagery. However, there is a minor text artifact: the phrase "strategically creative" is repeated verbatim in two separate paragraphs. While a small flaw, this exact repetition slightly disrupts the otherwise seamless flow and unique phrasing found elsewhere in the piece, reading as a minor authorial tic.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and often elegant, with strong imagery like the seed's "internal, shifting galaxy of colors." However, there are occasional patches of slightly overwrought or familiar phrasing ("cerulean sea," "wellspring from which all island truths flowed") that momentarily soften the impact. The momentum is excellent, with no significant scaffolding or loops to drag the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong, rhythmic cadence. Sentences like "his movements as patient and inevitable as the growth of stone" demonstrate high craft. However, there are minor instances of repetition that could be tightened, such as the direct restatement of "cerulean regret." While the language is beautiful, a few phrases like "a universe of understanding" feel slightly less specific than the rest of the sharp, concrete imagery.

Final paragraph is flawless cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. One mixed metaphor—“etched the pain deeper into the memory of the place”—barely grazes clarity. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.1)
    High-density, variegated syntax that breathes in step with ritual. No synonym loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("rivers of color and sound, of laughter and tears"). Final line’s "brilliantly restored tapestry" recharges opening "defiant hush" without muddle. Minor deduction: "pulsed, alive and desperate" slightly overwrites peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("unleashed a torrent," "threading poetry"). Figurative language sparse yet potent ("gilded cage of failure"). Technical phrasing ("infinitesimal variables") slightly jars but doesn’t obscure closure’s crystalline charge.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "thundering calm" repetition functions as intentional motif. High density: "vibrant, decaying greenery" compresses setting/emotion. Final line's "permanent as stone/light as butterfly wing" avoids cliché through precise duality.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold, but "ethically diligent weight that bent her shoulders" slightly overwrites physicality; high density persists even in peak beats like "cold a shock that clarified her mission," though minor figurative muddle touches escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops in climax, but "tenderly organized" repeats identically early on; high density falters with "dense, intricate knot" (redundant modifiers), though final image avoids figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; "house of cards" metaphor serves character logic. Propulsion accelerates through "each word was a step," with final line’s "frozen ground of the real" achieving high density. "Groundedly imaginative" slightly jars but doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless density: "melodic hum, a memory of music trapped within microscopic fragments" compresses theme/action/image. One near-loop in "perpetual mist" repetition prevents 9.0; no artifacts dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("deciphered," "biting"). Figurative language ("library," "sedimentary layers") integrates with POV without muddle. Final line's "dawning, rational curiosity" crystallizes closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    "Traveled stillness" repetition creates a subtle synonym loop in the final paragraph, slightly muddying the closure image despite otherwise precise rhythm and zero scaffolding in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "shimmering like captured starlight" shows textural specificity. Final line ("symphony—the quiet courage...") crystallizes theme without sentimentality or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is taut with high density ("a silent, sprawling void"), but minor scaffold appears ("she had never shown its contents to anyone. It was her private wonder"); no loops in peak beats, though "familiar anxious pull" borders on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.3)
    Near-flawless propulsion and density ("brittle tissue," "perpetual cool hush"); only minor register drift in "inadvertent archaeologist" and borderline mixed metaphor ("hushed blaze") prevent 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops; high density ("sloshed the last breath"). "Three hundred and forty-two" risks unmotivated precision but anchors closure. Final beat's "hummed in harmony" avoids overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story with surgical precision. Figurative language ("soundless sonic boom") heightens pressure without muddle, and final line’s cadence ("fertile feel of what was to come") delivers crystalline propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffold; "methodically hopeful" avoids label-speak through concrete actions (palette of dried paints, tracing exhaustion). Slight density dip in "thousand kindnesses swallowed by time" but closure beats remain sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops; "cloying, sentimental sorrow" slightly overwrought but pays off in final dread fusion. Strategic telling compresses journey. Final line’s "taste it" crystallizes motif without scaffold. No closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; "latent radiance" passage achieves high density: "not a light that shone upon something, but a light that was something" shows purposeful variation. Minor cliché ("frantic slash") saved by context.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold in "whisper slithered... whisper came again" dulls immediacy; otherwise vivid propulsion through concrete verbs ("gasped," "shuddered") avoids figurative muddle in climax.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in opening ("amorphous indigo... bruised, fractious clouds... spiraling void") risks density overload, but high-pressure beats avoid figurative muddle. Final image ("luminous lemon") delivers crystalline propulsion with zero loops, though not quite 9.0 due to slight cadence stiffness in setup.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion, but "sunwashed dread" in early description risks abstract labeling; minor register drift from Kaelen’s expertise ("sacred geometry") to lyrical phrasing slightly dulls immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels tension ("The final petal trembled... dropped. Its fall was the signal"). Final image ("breathtaking beauty and terrible contradiction") crystallizes dualities without muddle. Peak-beat metaphors precise and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "cerulean blue" specificity replaces abstraction, but slight sensory repetition ("water shockingly cold"/"fingers numb") prevents 9.0; zero loops in closure beat maintains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.6)
    No loops or scaffold—every sentence does triple duty (e.g., "light and shadow playing over endless shelves" sets atmosphere, theme, and action); final line’s "reclaimed a part of it forever" has crystalline rhythm without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; high density with propulsion ("She blew the glass... her breath giving shape to pain"). Final paragraph's cadence ("circled... ascended... felt her spirit descend while ascending") achieves rhythmic perfection. Minor density in "central floating isle" description costs 0.1; no figurative muddle near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via dense, multi-jobbing lines ("a cathedral of amethyst spikes" serves character and setting). Final line’s crystalline simplicity ("learn how to drink") avoids overwriting while charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or stakes (e.g., "glowing data now streaming... onto the ancient instrument" compresses tech and ritual without overwriting).

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero scaffold or loops; "minuscule weight a profound pressure" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line’s "silencing" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "sliver of waxing crescent" and "toxic energy neutralized" exemplify high-density propulsion; minor abstraction in "carved features" redeemed by immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "clenched fist of sorrow" crystallizes emotion without cliché. Figurative language sparse but potent ("guttering thing," "psychic weight"). Final line’s "nowhere, and everywhere" achieves density without muddle—propels closure with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("ethereal blue light pulsed from intricate fungal patterns") propels without muddle. Final line’s "fragile ember" achieves textural specificity. One borderline purple phrase ("delicately robust") avoided cost-dulling through thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("molecules aligning to her will"). Figurative language serves pressure ("celestial fire painting moonlight") without muddle. Final line's paradox recharges prior material with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; "blood along the crack shimmered" does triple duty (visual/emotional/thematic). Figurative language precise ("hairline crack a tiny white lightning bolt"). Minor overwriting in "choking beauty" repetition costs 0.1 in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is immaculate with high density ("fossilized fact in the databanks"), but "profound, almost physical lightening" risks therapy-speak abstraction in a peak beat, narrowly avoiding Q7 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "fine black grit whispered under worn shoes" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line risks simplicity but works within Earned Stasis—no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops in closure beat; "cradle of sparks" avoids muddle. Template cadence in investigation sequence ("He moved... He angled...") but variation follows. "Pathetic flicker" slightly overwrites, yet density supports propulsion. Final line recharges quill holder motif flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "silent, sliding things" establishes texture early. Every line multi-tasks: "fractured mirror" describes both curse and insight. Final line ("feeling the first real dawn...") crystallizes closure without abstraction—pure image propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "cartography of scars" repetition functions as intentional motif. High density ("voice a frail but steady thread woven into roaring tapestry") propels momentum. One borderline purple phrase ("seed cast onto fertile lightning") prevents 9.0 but doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.1)
    Zero loops and strong propulsion, but "dignified chaos resolved into perfect, peaceful sense" creates a mixed metaphor that dulls closure image, violating text-artifact guard for peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "rusted library" reappears with shifting meaning. Final line ("fracture had become luminous") crystallizes theme without abstraction. Minor deduction: "blooming resistance" slightly vague amid concrete prose.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion, but high-pressure beats risk density ("luminous, gaseous flora that pulsed and swayed with a rhythm as old as time") bordering on overwriting without pattern payoff. Final image clarity prevents severe deduction; scaffold-free.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    No loops or scaffold; propulsion remains strong even in reflective beats. Minor overwriting in "crystal clear" (redundant) and "galaxy of colors" (slightly generic) in the climax, but no artifacts dull the closure image's luminous charge.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold—every line propels ("sorrow as vast and blue as the ocean" crystallizes emotion without cliché); final line ("washed anew on a familiar shore") delivers crystalline closure with no figurative muddle, though "cerulean regret" repetition slightly risks thematic echo.
